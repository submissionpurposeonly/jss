AB  - The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in domains like manufacturing, where knowledge sharing and retrieval play crucial roles. Traditionally, manufacturers relied on extensive databases and manual querying processes, often limited by domain-specific vocabulary and collaboration challenges. LLMs, with their advanced capabilities in document retrieval and summarization, have spurred interest in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, particularly for enhancing decision support systems. Existing approaches to knowledge retrieval, such as hybrid methods combining sparse and dense retrieval, face limitations in interpretability and fine-tuning performance when applied to noisy or scarce manufacturing data. To address these gaps, this study introduces SEASONED (SEquentiAl denoiSing cONtrastive EncoDing), a novel LLM-based contrastive representation learning framework that incorporates triplet loss learning and attention heatmaps to improve retriever module performance and interpretability in RAG pipelines. By leveraging both TSDAE and contrastive fine-tuning, SEASONED enables Efficient sub-cluster segregation and differentiation between closely related sentences. Experimental evaluation on two datasets—one open-source and one proprietary manufacturing dataset—demonstrates that SEASONED enhances document retrieval performance by 28 to 58% (accuracy) and 21 to 62% (Mean Reciprocal Rank - MRR) and compared to six state-of-the-art architectures.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of robotic systems for inspection and maintenance is gaining importance due to the number of scenarios in which robots can operate. Indeed, robotic systems provide many advantages in harsh and hostile environments, improving workers’ safety and overall efficiency. Given their ability to perform different tasks, robotic manipulators constitute a significant proportion of the possible robotic systems employed in these environments. The category of manipulators is a heterogeneous group that comprises many different types of robots: non-redundant, redundant, and hyper-redundant manipulators, the latter being subdivided into discrete-joint manipulators and continuum manipulators. Among these types of robots, hyper-redundant manipulators play a crucial role in operating in challenging environments due to their ability to perform auxiliary tasks, such as obstacle avoidance and joint limits satisfaction. Furthermore, manipulators can be made of rigid or soft mechanisms and can be mobile, operating in aerial, ground, and underwater environments. The objective of this review article is to provide a reference point for researchers interested in modelling and controlling manipulators for inspection and maintenance in challenging environments.

AB  - Building environmental assessment (BEA) is critical to improving sustainability. However, the BEA process is inefficient, costly, and often inaccurate. Because automation has the potential to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the BEA process, studies have focused on automating BEA (ABEA). Updated until now, a comprehensive analysis of prevailing literature on ABEA remains absent. This study conducts the first comprehensive systematic analysis appraising the state-of-the-art of research on ABEA. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided to systematically analyse 91 relevant studies. Results uncover that only 29.7% of BEA systems worldwide have automated their processes, with the US LEED residing at the vanguard of automation efforts. The New Buildings scheme was mostly focused on, while largely ignoring other schemes, e.g., Existing Buildings. Five key digital approaches to ABEA were revealed, namely building information modelling (BIM) and plug-in software, BIM-ontology, data mining and machine learning, cloud-BIM, and digital twin-based approaches. Based on identified gaps, future research directions are proposed, specifically: using data mining and machine learning models for ABEA; development of a holistic cloud-based approach for real-time BEA; and digital twin for dynamic BEA. This study generates a deeper understanding of ABEA and its theoretical implications, such as major constructs and emerging perspectives, constitute a basis for holistic, and innovation in, BEA.

AB  - A systematic scoping review was performed to map literature in the field of Design for Disassembly (DfD) in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry and identify existing built DfD structures to compare the current DfD practice and research front. Online scientific databases and architecture magazines were searched and almost 470 journal and conference articles, grey literature, and online magazine articles were selected for scope mapping and case study analysis. Based on the gathered literature the key research focus areas were identified as follows: analysis (barriers identification, standard development, literature review, feasibility study, ethical issues), frameworks, Building Information Modelling (BIM), tool development (indicator, method, technology), and case study analysis (concepts, structures, connections). Qualitative and quantitative data for 151 built DfD structure examples identified in the literature were collected and analysed to give an overview of the current practices and trends in the AEC industry. The DfD building was found to have various definitions and implementations and 50% of the built DfD structures have area below 300 m2. The structure in 75% of the identified existing DfD buildings is made of timber while research literature into enabling technology is dominated by the development of the connections for reinforced concrete and hybrid concrete–steel structures.

However, many apps still fail to bind users long-term. Although research has been conducted on individual mechanisms aiming to improve long-term user adoption, such as gamification, we lack an understanding of different approaches at the time of this research. Thus, in this research, we investigate different approaches and persuasive technology that aim to keep the users’ engagement with the app in use. Therefore, this study reviews existing literature and tries to identify how motivational mechanisms can be successfully implemented. In the course of this, identify 14 major motivational mechanisms to increase long-term user adoption of mobile apps. Based on these insights, we want to give advice on how to improve their impact through combination as well as give advice on future implementation.

AB  - Fatigue remains a critical contributor to human error in Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems, posing significant risks to aviation safety. The mentally demanding nature of ATC tasks, particularly during transitions from automated to manual control, intensifies the challenges associated with fatigue. While existing fatigue detection methods are broadly categorized into behavioral, physiological, and subjective approaches, there is limited understanding on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized in this context. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 105 peer-reviewed studies, focusing on both technological and human-centric dimensions of fatigue management in ATC. The review explores key advancements in fatigue detection strategies, including the development of reliable data collection platforms, refined feature classification techniques, and the use of simulation-based assessments. It further highlights the potential of AI to enhance traditional human factors frameworks by enabling a more integrated approach that balances human adaptability with automated support. Ultimately, this review provides actionable insights for both academia and industry, offering a comprehensive foundation for evolving fatigue risk management practices in alignment with Industry 5.0′s emphasis on human-centric automation.

AB  - Digital Twin (DT) technology has gained significant attention in various areas, including nuclear energy. Technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-fidelity modeling and simulation have been studied to further the digitalization of the nuclear industry. In this paper, an overview of the DT initiatives and developments for the design optimization and intelligent transformation of nuclear energy systems is described to provide a development trend of DT technology for nuclear reactors. For the design of DT for complex systems such as nuclear reactors, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) technology offers requirements models, design processes, and system verification that are clearer, more precise, and more comprehensive. Four properties of Digital Twin for Nuclear Reactor System (DTNRS) are summarized, which are given by the block definition diagram of MBSE philosophy. Then, to bridge the gap between numerical models and theoretical research of DT, a systematic and hierarchical “V” architecture is proposed, which reflects the digital-related technologies of the DTNRS throughout the whole life cycle. Furthermore, a four-layered decomposition construction model is developed and a prospective application scenario of DTNRS is pictured. Finally, the five-step instructive demonstration of the DTNRS is given based on a Generation III (GEN-III) reactor with its visualized condition map.

However, existing literature lacks a critical assessment of their current applications, implementation challenges, and developmental opportunities. To address this gap, a systematic review was conducted, which included bibliometric and content analyses of 107 and 92 studies published between 2010 and 2024, respectively. The results reveal eight primary WSD application areas: health and fatigue monitoring, hazard identification, activity recognition, location tracking, fall detection, environmental sensing, communication and training. Four operational limitations, six adoption barriers, future research needs, and device development opportunities were identified and thoroughly discussed. A conceptual action framework was developed to outline the strategic roles and policy mechanisms necessary to support WSD implementation. This paper provides a consolidated foundation to guide future research and the effective use of WSDs to improve construction safety.

AB  - Summary
Despite rapidly rising incarceration rates, the health needs of women in custody are overlooked. This Review aims to summarise the current evidence on the health of women in prisons around the world. In this systematic review, we searched peer-reviewed and grey literature databases for quantitative studies published between Jan 1, 2003, and Jan 29, 2025. Our population of interest was people detained in carceral spaces designated for women as part of the criminal-legal system worldwide. We included studies that reported the prevalence of health conditions (based on the Global Burden of Disease Study, or in the International Classification of Disease 11th revision) among women in custody. We assessed risk of bias using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. We identified 18 008 unique records, 247 studies (including more than 452 261 women) were included for analysis. Nearly all studies had a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Communicable diseases and mental health conditions were the most frequently described topics. Prevalence of many conditions varied widely between studies and across geographical regions. We identified gaps in the literature, particularly around non-communicable conditions and in the geographical representation of data. Globally, women in custody experience a high burden of health conditions but there are substantial gaps in current evidence and a need for improved data collection and reporting. Additionally, limitations found in some studies included the exclusion of people with complex health-care needs and the use of measures such as self-reporting, which depend on previous access to health care, and it is likely that the true burden of health conditions among incarcerated women is even greater. The findings of this Review call the correctional, health, and research communities to act to reduce the health inequities faced by women in prison.

AB  - Hydrogen is increasingly viewed as an essential element in the global transition toward low-carbon and sustainable energy systems. This review systematically evaluates the major hydrogen production pathways, spanning mature fossil-based processes, steam methane reforming, dry methane reforming, catalytic methane decomposition, and coal gasification, to emerging renewable routes including biomass gasification, water electrolysis, photolytic methods, and biological/biochemical processes. Each technology is critically assessed through integrated techno-economic and environmental analyses, examining efficiency, carbon intensity, technological readiness levels, and scalability potential. Life cycle assessments reveal that conventional methods, while cost-effective ($1.25–2.27/kg H2), generate substantial CO2 emissions (9–20 kg CO2-eq/kg H2). Conversely, renewable pathways demonstrate significantly lower environmental impacts but face economic and technological barriers limiting commercial deployment. Key challenges identified include catalyst deactivation, high capital costs for electrolyzers, and low efficiencies in photolytic systems (∼5%). The review establishes strategic research priorities: developing durable, cost-effective catalysts; advancing high-temperature electrolysis technologies; integrating renewable energy systems; and scaling photobiological platforms. This analysis provides actionable insights for researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers to accelerate hydrogen technology development and deployment, supporting the transition toward a sustainable, hydrogen-based energy economy aligned with net-zero emission targets.

AB  - Industry 4.0 technologies present transformative potential in data acquisition for production activities, promising to revolutionize the Life Cycle Inventory process. Despite acknowledging their utility in environmental impact analysis, a gap exists in understanding the specific applicability of these technologies to fulfill ISO 14044 criteria. This study addresses the gap by introducing innovative approaches to Life Cycle Assessment through Industry 4.0 technologies. Beyond existing research, technologies directly impacting LCA development are identified, along with a classification for optimal usage in the LCA process. The crucial role of these technologies in enhanced data collection across life cycle phases is highlighted, introducing a scoring mechanism to identify the technology excelling in enabling Life Cycle Inventory development. Employing a developed framework and systematic literature review, the study aims to identify Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing that facilitate LCA. Findings illuminate potential contributions across different product life cycle stages, with cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and Simulation and Modelling identified as the most effective technologies for constructing Life Cycle Inventories. The outcomes provide guidance for practitioners in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies into manufacturing activities, offering valuable insights for environmental sustainability assessment.

AB  - The field of Energy System Analysis (ESA) has experienced exponential growth in the number of publications in the last two decades. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on ESA by employing different statistical techniques to investigate the underlying science's structure, characteristics, and patterns. The focus of results is on quantitative indicators relating to the number and type of publication outputs, collaboration links between institutions, authors and countries, and dynamic trends within the field. The five and twelve most productive countries have 50% and 80% of ESA publications, respectively. The dominant institutions are even more concentrated within a small number of countries. A significant concentration of published papers within countries and institutions was also confirmed by analysing collaboration networks. These show dominant collaboration within the same university or at least the same country. There is also a strong link among the most successful journals, authors and institutions. Within the field, the Energy journal has had the most publications, its editor-in-chief is the author with both the highest overall number of publications and the most highly cited publications. In terms of the dynamics within the field in the past decade, recent years have seen a higher impact of topics related to flexibility and hybrid/integrated energy systems alongside a decline in individual technologies. This paper provides a holistic overview of two decades' research output and enables interested readers to obtain a comprehensive overview of the key trends in this active field.

AB  - Background
Motion tracking technologies serve as crucial links between physical activities and health care insights, facilitating data acquisition essential for analyzing and intervening in physical activity. Yet, systematic methodologies for evaluating motion tracking data, especially concerning user activity recognition in health care applications, remain underreported.
Objective
This study aims to systematically review motion tracking in daily living and physical activities, emphasizing the critical interaction among devices, users, and environments from a design perspective, and to analyze the process involved in health care application research. It intends to delineate the design and application intricacies in health care contexts, focusing on enhancing motion tracking data’s accuracy and applicability for health monitoring and intervention strategies.
Methods
Using a systematic review, this research scrutinized motion tracking data and their application in health care and wellness, examining studies from Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and PubMed databases. The review used actor network theory and data-enabled design to understand the complex interplay between humans, devices, and environments within these applications.
Results
Out of 1501 initially identified studies, 54 (3.66%) were included for in-depth analysis. These articles predominantly used accelerometer and gyroscope sensors (n=43, 80%) to monitor and analyze motion, demonstrating a strong preference for these technologies in capturing both dynamic and static activities. While incorporating portable devices (n=11, 20%) and multisensor configurations (n=16, 30%), the application of sensors across the body (n=15, 28%) and within physical spaces (n=17, 31%) highlights the diverse applications of motion tracking technologies in health care research. This diversity reflects the application’s alignment with activity types ranging from daily movements to specialized scenarios. The results also reveal a diverse participant pool, including the general public, athletes, and specialized groups, with a focus on healthy individuals (n=31, 57%) and athletes (n=14, 26%). Despite this extensive application range, the focus primarily on laboratory-based studies (n=39, 72%) aimed at professional uses, such as precise activity identification and joint functionality assessment, emphasizes a significant challenge in translating findings from controlled environments to the dynamic conditions of everyday physical activities.
Conclusions
This study’s comprehensive investigation of motion tracking technology in health care research reveals a significant gap between the methods used for data collection and their practical application in real-world scenarios. It proposes an innovative approach that includes designers in the research process, emphasizing the importance of incorporating data-enabled design framework. This ensures that motion data collection is aligned with the dynamic and varied nature of daily living and physical activities. Such integration is crucial for developing health applications that are accessible, intuitive, and tailored to meet diverse user needs. By leveraging a multidisciplinary approach that combines design, engineering, and health sciences, the research opens new pathways for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of health technologies.

AB  - Increasing market and labour costs arouse an urgent need to develop automatic mechanised tea picking equipment over mountainous tea plantation area. To address the poor operational stability of existing machines, this paper proposes a new design of an omnidirectional dynamic four-point levelling platform and the levelling control algorithms based on four-point levelling and central immobile levelling method. A prototype is built to test the static and dynamic levelling performance on a simulated mountainous terrain. Different from other conventional four-point levelling platforms, the rotary motion is added to this platform and the number of control units is reduced to reduce the difficulty of manoeuvring. These developments result in a damage-free feature when the rotation or inclination motion is beyond the normal manoeuvre range. The test results of the prototype showed that the inclination error of the platform was controlled at 1.1°–1.9° in 2–2.5 s during the static levelling test on a mountainous terrain with a slope of 15°. The dynamic levelling was tested on a mountainous terrain with varied slopes between 10° and 20° and the inclination error range of the platform was 1.7°–2.2°. The field tests confirmed that the levelling system can achieve omnidirectional dynamic levelling in the case of tea picking operations in mountainous areas with slopes below 20°.

AB  - Introduction
This work aims to study the current scenario of dosimetry audits in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) in Europe to evaluate whether there is a need to implement more services of this type and to define the characteristics that they should meet according to users.
Material and methods
A survey consisting of 30 multiple choice questions was designed and distributed among European centers. The estimated time to answer was less than 15 min. 74 HDR BT centers participated, having 192Ir, 60Co and/or electronic sources. Information about users’ opinions and experience with dosimetry audits in this field, center resources and quality assurance (QA) procedures was gathered.
Results
For 61 % of users, dosimetry audits in HDR BT should be recommended, but not mandatory, whereas 35 % suggested that they are necessary and should be compulsory. Only for 4 % of participants these audits are not necessary. In contrast, 86 % of users found that the current number of these services is inadequate and that more national and/or international services are needed. Most participants operate according to QA recommendations of published guidelines, with exceptions, such as the use of the Reference Air Kerma Rate provided by the manufacturer instead of the one measured by the home medical physicist.
Conclusion
The number of HDR BT dosimetry audits available to users is inadequate and there is a need to implement more national and/or international services of this type. Some technical aspects that an audit of this type should fulfill are outlined in this work.

AB  - Meeting the mobility needs of urban residents using formal transport systems in developing country cities such as Accra is often fraught with challenges. Paratransit modes have thus, over the years, tended to fill the void created by the shortcomings of formal systems. Their dominance is however often associated with various setbacks which often militate against achieving sustainable urban mobility in developing countries' towns and cities such as Accra. The quest to develop sustainable urban transport modes has often led to marginalisation and outlawing of paratransit operations in these regions despite their notable contributions to urban mobility. This scoping review presents a deeper understanding of paratransit's role by addressing: its broader scope and meaning; its contribution to first- and last-mile connectivity; how it serves underserved populations; its operational strengths and weaknesses; the extent to which it complements formal transport systems and its general overview in the Ghanaian context. These findings are expected to set the stage for further empirical study of how paratransit can be integrated into formal urban transport systems to achieve sustainable public urban transport in Accra given the failure of previous attempts to implement the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in the city.

AB  - Lower temperature heating (LTH) involves using the lowest possible supply temperatures to meet residential heating demands, thus supporting the integration of sustainable heating sources and decarbonising the existing residential stock. However, choosing appropriate energy renovation options to prepare existing dwellings for LTH presents decision-making challenges due to the heterogenous dwelling stock with varying building characteristics, numerous renovation options, and various performance indicators for evaluating trade-offs. This study aims to review the scientific literature on integrating LTH into existing dwellings to identify the building characteristics for evaluating the potential of using LTH and the necessity for renovations, presents a systematic method for organising renovation options and summarises key performance indicators. The study employed the SALSA (search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis) framework for systematic review and identified 24 scientific publications. Findings show that dwelling characteristics such as compactness ratio, thermal insulation, thermal bridges, airtightness, ventilation systems, space heating system capacity and supply temperature level are essential for investigating LTH potential and the need for renovations. Most research lacks qualitative renovation criteria and product-level information for selecting renovation options. Key performance indicators related to energy efficiency, thermal comfort and quality-of-services can help indicate the possible solutions, while those related to environmental and economic performance indicate the feasibility of possible solutions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of standard set of criteria for indicating the dwelling's readiness for using LTH. These findings can help address the decision-making challenges of selecting appropriate renovation strategies to enable the use of LTH and contribute to decarbonising the built environment.

AB  - In the current job matching of students in higher vocational colleges, the traditional recommendation system often faces some problems, such as inaccurate job information matching, insufficient personalization of recommendation and poor user experience. This paper studies the design and implementation of student job matching system based on personalized recommendation algorithm, aiming at improving students' job matching degree and satisfaction through systematic methods. Firstly, the basic principle of personalized recommendation algorithm, including collaborative filtering and content recommendation algorithm, is discussed, and combined with the employment characteristics of students in higher vocational colleges, the job matching needs are analyzed. It is pointed out that higher vocational students are faced with limited employment opportunities and unequal skill level, so the recommendation system needs to meet the diversification of job information, personalized management of student data and ease of use of the system. When conducting user behavior analysis, it was observed that in a total of 598 user interactions, the average dwell time per user was 3.5 min and the number of page views reached 4.506. This indicates that the user's interest in the content is higher. The statistics of user activity show that the conversion rate is 70.2 %, which shows strong user engagement. There are a total of 523 active events in the system, of which 38 events have significant user interaction frequencies. Finally, this paper provides in-depth theoretical basis and practical guidance for the application of personalized recommendation algorithm in the field of employment matching.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is now an integral part of our daily life and society. AI offers numerous affordances with potential positive and negative impact on society. K-12 educators are responsible to prepare the future generations to harness the benefits of AI ethically, responsibly, safely, and critically. Teachers need sound knowledge, skills, and dispositions to implement ethics-driven AI literacy education. To achieve this goal, there is need to identify and operationalize the competencies that teachers need to foster AI literacy. We conducted a larger systematic literature review (SLR), which reviewed empirical studies focused on AI literacy published in the last ten years (2014-2024) to explore and consolidate all competencies for K-12 teachers. This paper reports on teachers’ ethical competencies identified from this SLR. The review of 76 papers included in the final dataset unveils that the ethical AI competencies are interdependent and co-occur in a given context such that teachers may need a combination of knowledge, skills, and dispositions to successfully implement AI literacy education. The findings revealed that teachers need (1) the knowledge competencies of AI ethics issues, limitations of AI, socio-political awareness, and human in the loop, (2) skills of AI transparency and explainability, critical analysis of AI, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy, and (3) the dispositions of AI ethics sensitivity, critical attitude towards AI, and being inclusive and culturally responsive. These ethical competencies can inform teacher preparation and professional development programs for teachers to leverage AI technologies ethically in education.

AB  - Sustainable sludge management in wastewater treatment plants is a critical challenge that demands strategic planning and holistic evaluation tools. This study presents a novel data-driven framework for sustainable, multifunctional circular sludge management. Unlike conventional models, the framework integrates circular planning, scenario-based foresight, a data-driven approach, and sustainability assessment to identify optimal sludge reuse pathways and treatment alternatives. A dynamic 3D SWOT methodology is employed to prioritise circular actions. We also introduce a modified decision support system incorporating 15 new criteria across 39 parameters, supported by uncertainty analysis. To demonstrate the framework, we applied it to a wastewater treatment plant in Iran. Seven circular reuse strategies were assessed: sanitised landfill, compost for agriculture, incineration for bricks, road pavement, concrete paving blocks, incineration for ceramics, and clay-based pipelines. These were evaluated across 24,000 potential future scenarios. The model was run over 500 times to perform a comprehensive sensitivity analysis on strategic and assessment outcomes. Results identified composting use as the most optimal strategy. The most sustainable treatment configuration included dissolved air flotation, anaerobic digestion, and pressurised strip filters. Sensitivity analysis revealed key external and internal drivers, highlighted the importance of temporal attributes, and showed the influence of expert judgment. The framework delivers resilient, adaptive, and context-sensitive solutions for sustainable sludge management. It serves as a robust decision-making tool for infrastructure planners, policymakers, and environmental engineers. However, the approach has limitations, including dependence on data availability, equal probability for all scenarios, and assumptions in scenario modelling, which should be considered in broader applications.

AB  - Emerging green and sustainable energy (GSE) sectors, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and green hydrogen (GH) are crucial for achieving the global decarbonization goals. This study provides critical insights from 157 articles published in Scopus and Web of Science databases by employing PRISMA approach. It was found that combining circular economy (CE) with life cycle assessment (LCA) offers clear sustainability benefits though effective evaluation of environmental impacts. Major identified gaps are methodological variations, geographical concentration of CE-LCA studies, limited focus on real-world applications, and non-inclusion of socio-economic dimensions. The study highlights the role of CE-LCA in resource efficiency, particularly in battery recycling and GH production. Furthermore, adoption of methodological harmonization and policy-aligned frameworks were found to significantly influence the practical application of CE-LCA models. Notably, second-life applications of batteries and waste-to-hydrogen systems were found to be promising strategies to reduce the global warming potential and improve the circularity outcomes. The study recommends the standardization of CE-LCA frameworks, development of region-specific life cycle inventory databases, and their inclusion into policy and regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and internet of things into CE-LCA practices is essential to enhance data quality, enable real-time monitoring, and support sustainability assessments.

AB  - Containerization in multi-cloud environments has received significant attention in recent years both from academic research and industrial development perspectives. However, there exists no effort to systematically investigate the state of research on this topic. The aim of this research is to systematically identify and categorize the multiple aspects of containerization in multi-cloud environment. We conducted the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) on the literature published between January 2013 and July 2024. One hundred twenty one studies were selected and the key results are: (1) Four leading themes on containerization in multi-cloud environment are identified: ‘Scalability and High Availability’, ‘Performance and Optimization’, ‘Security and Privacy’, and ‘Multi-Cloud Container Monitoring and Adaptation’. (2) Ninety-eight patterns and strategies for containerization in multi-cloud environment were classified across 10 subcategories and 4 categories. (3) Ten quality attributes considered were identified with 47 associated tactics. (4) Four catalogs consisting of challenges and solutions related to security, automation, deployment, and monitoring were introduced. The results of this SMS will assist researchers and practitioners in pursuing further studies on containerization in multi-cloud environment and developing specialized solutions for containerization applications in multi-cloud environment.

AB  - Statement of problem
The outcome of posterior nonvital teeth depends not only on endodontic factors but also on the effectiveness of the restoration. The growing trend in minimally invasive dentistry has led to increasing interest in 1-piece endodontic crowns as an alternative restoration. Nevertheless, their indications and longevity lack extensive exploration, thereby limiting their widespread acceptance in dental practice.
Purpose
The purpose of this overview was to synthesize the available evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) about 1-piece endodontic crowns and to identify clinical outcomes such as survival, success rates, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).
Material and methods
A systematic search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and OpenGrey, as well as a manual search, up to June 2024, with no language or time restriction. SRs that addressed clinical studies related to 1-piece endodontic crowns or endocrowns were included. The risk of bias and methodological quality was measured using the ROBIS and AMSTAR-2 tools, respectively.
Results
The search identified 468 articles, of which 9 SRs were included. The best evidence reported in the SRs was that survival or success rates for ceramic and indirect resin 1-piece endodontic crowns were high at 5 years, similar to those for conventional crowns. Loss of retention was the main cause of failure with similar failure rates for molars and premolars. Evidence for the use of zirconia and metal 1-piece endodontic crowns is limited, and no SR was found that addressed PROMs. Methodological quality was considered low or critically low in most SRs. However, the risk of bias was low for 2 of the 3 SRs that provided the best evidence in the meta-analysis for ceramic and indirect resin 1-piece endodontic crowns. Overlap in the included studies was very high.
Conclusions
Although the evidence generated by multiple RS only determined that ceramic and indirect resin 1-piece endodontic crowns can be a suitable and reliable option for restoring endodontically treated premolars and molars, with high success and survival rates comparable with those of complete crowns with posts, this overview concluded that it was not possible to provide firm conclusions regarding the outcomes of 1-piece endodontic crowns because of the lack of adequate high-quality primary studies with different materials, heterogenicity of the studies, variations in follow-up, preparation, and operative steps, and very high overlap of studies. Thus, additional well-designed clinical trials are necessary rather than SRs to strengthen the evidence in this area.

AB  - Coreless axial flux permanent magnet machines (C-AFPMMs) offer exceptional efficiency, power, and torque density by eliminating iron losses, making them attractive for applications like electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and aircraft propulsion. However, the coreless design introduces challenges, including complex mechanical structures, high production costs due to the usage of conventional materials, unstable axial forces leading to mechanical instability, potential cooling difficulties, and higher energy dissipation rates. Recent innovations in winding designs, advanced magnet arrays, and material technologies, combined with novel optimization techniques, have significantly enhanced the electromagnetic performance of these machines. This systematic review synthesizes advancements in AFPMMs with a focus on coreless technology, evaluating research developments, innovations, and applications from 2004 to 2024, based on a comprehensive analysis of 149 articles indexed by major databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and IEEE. The findings indicate sustained and increasing research activity from 2019 to 2024, with key areas of focus. Of the three coreless designs, single stator double rotors (SSDR) with stator coreless are the most commonly used, followed by double stators single rotor (DSSR) and fully coreless multi-stators multi-rotors (MSMR). There is also growing interest in rotor coreless designs, despite challenges like flux leakage, with Halbach magnet arrays of unconventional shapes being explored to mitigate these effects. These insights highlight the potential for enhancing modular configurations and thermal management in C-AFPMMs through the integration of high-strength materials, 3D printing of parts, and advanced optimization methods.

AB  - With the growing need for economical and energy-efficient space heating solutions in residential buildings, heat pumps have emerged as a promising alternative for domestic heating systems. Heat pumps are a key piece of equipment in the global shift to a safe and sustainable heating technology. This review presents a thorough analysis and synthesis of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on domestic heat pumps and commences with the basic ideas behind heat pump technology as well as the need for LCAs in determining the technology’s environmental impact This review systematically addresses several aspects, it (i) examines the existing literature on LCAs conducted for domestic heat pumps, aiming to assess their environmental effect across their life cycle stages; (ii) discusses the key environmental indicators and parameters commonly assessed in LCAs for domestic heat pumps; (iii) states the challenges, limitations, and restrictions in conducting LCAs for these systems. Due to the missing data and inconsistency of relevant parameters such as functional units, refrigerants, electricity mix, and others, this investigation highlights the necessity for standardized methodologies and data quality refinements, which should account for electricity mix variability, refrigerant leakage, and relevant performance metrics. Conducting a comprehensive review of LCA studies over the last two decades offers this study a novelty in identifying inconsistencies in key assessment criteria and proposes a structured approach to standardizing LCA methodologies for heat pumps. This offers recommendations for future research directions to support the development of sustainable heating technologies in residential structures. In conclusion, the LCA conducted on heat pumps reveals valuable insights into their environmental impact across various stages. Moreover, the findings of this LCA contribute to the broader discussion on eco-friendly and energy-efficient residential heating solutions.

AB  - As global energy demand continues to rise, the importance of effective solar management in building design becomes increasingly critical. Solar management encompasses strategies for harvesting, regulating, and utilizing solar energy, contributing significantly to sustainable and renewable energy solutions. Biomimetics presents a promising approach to adaptive design by drawing inspiration from nature’s solar management strategies. This research conducts a systematic review of biomimetic adaptive solar building envelopes (Bio-ASBEs), classifying them into three key solar management strategies: solar regulation, solar harvesting, and thermoregulation. A comparative analysis of existing studies highlights trends, gaps, and opportunities in the field. Findings indicate growing interest in biomimetic solutions for solar management, with a predominant focus on energy efficiency. However, the study identifies limited research on energy harvesting and indoor environmental quality, as well as a reliance on shading techniques, potentially overlooking alternative thermoregulation and solar harvesting strategies. Furthermore, the study highlights the scarcity of mixed-method research, emphasizing the need for multifaceted approaches that integrate, qualitative and quantitative data into actionable solutions. Finally, this study reveals the untapped potential of biomimetic solar management strategies, demonstrating how integrating solar harvesting, regulation, and thermoregulation can drive the development of adaptive, energy-efficient building envelopes. By bridging research gaps and exploring nature-inspired multifunctional solutions, it paves the way for scalable, climate-responsive technologies that support net-zero goals and a more sustainable built environment.

AB  - Frequent workplace accidents associated with rapid industrialization has become the global focus. Such accidents not only pose a serious threat to the safety and health of employees but can also incur substantial economic losses and reputational damage for companies. Therefore, determining ways to effectively reduce workplace accidents and their possibilities has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. In the field of safety management, numerous scholars and practitioners are committed to researching and applying various theories and methods to improve workplace safety. Recently, the Dempster–Shafer theory (DST) has garnered attention an important uncertainty reasoning method in the field of safety management. By integrating information from multiple sources, the theory can make effective reasoning using uncertain or incomplete information and provide strong support for safety management decision-making. Recently, neural computation techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of DST, enabling more efficient fusion and analysis of complex and high-dimensional safety data. In view of this, this study systematically reviews relevant papers on DST in the field of safety, accident, and emergency management and forms a systematic literature review (SLR). To support and guide the completion of this work, this paper proposes three research questions based on the 4R crisis management theoretical framework. On the same theoretical basis, the selected literature is sorted and analyzed according to the four dimensions of Reduction, Readiness, Response and Recovery, covering all aspects of these dimensions; moreover, the results are obtained through SLR. The final results show that DST enhanced with neural computation plays vital roles in the field of safety, accident, and emergency management. This coupling reduces the limitations of DST, expanding its scope in the process. However, several limitations remain to be solved. Accordingly, this paper analyzes ways to solve the extended theory, practical application dimension, and related defects of DST in the field of safety, accident, and emergency management and draws some conclusions.

AB  - Under the intensive sheep farming model, traditional monitoring and management methods face issues such as outdated equipment and low efficiency, which cannot fully meet the requirements for refined and intelligent management in breeding. This paper reviews the application of non-invasive monitoring technology in intensive sheep farms, analyzing the differences and application scenarios between contact and non-contact sensors. The results show that contact sensors have advantages such as relatively precise, continuous, and accurate monitoring of individual animals with minimal stress responses during use. However, they also have drawbacks, including wear and tear caused by stress and high equipment maintenance costs. Non-contact sensors, on the other hand, offer advantages such as scalability for group use, high accuracy, non-interference with sheep behavior, and no disruption of flock habits. Non-invasive monitoring technology demonstrates good accuracy and applicability in individual identification, behavior analysis, body measurement parameters, and physiological indicators. In the future, through in-depth integration of multidisciplinary and multi-field approaches and deep learning of multiple algorithms, non-invasive monitoring technology is expected to develop towards low cost and intelligence, providing a comprehensive solution for smart animal husbandry.

AB  - In recent years, intelligent welding technology has emerged as a prominent focus within the welding domain, amalgamating a diverse array of sophisticated technologies, including robotics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and sensor systems. This integration heralds unprecedented levels of automation in welding processes, endowing them with heightened efficiency, precision, and cognitive capabilities. Notably, scholarly attention has been dedicated to the realms of intelligent welding manufacturing and welding robotics. However, a discernible lacuna exists in the form of a comprehensive review elucidating the pivotal technologies underpinning welding robots, while research about autonomous mobile welding robots appears to have encountered a developmental impasse. In response, this study undertakes a systematic literature review to scrutinize the core technologies of humanoid welding robots (HWR), positing their elevated research prospects within the milieu of next-generation intelligent welding manufacturing. This study explores the hardware of humanoid welding robots as an emerging technology, drawing on current advancements in humanoid robotics. The key technologies relevant to both humanoid and welding robots are also examined, highlighting their integration and potential applications. Initially, the discourse delves into hand-eye calibration methodologies, delineating a multifaceted approach predicated upon a multi-coordinate system tailored to HWR. Subsequently, the significance of visual-based pose estimation and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques is underscored, given their instrumental role in furnishing HWR with environmental cognition, a discourse expounded meticulously. Additionally, meticulous scrutiny is accorded to mobile robot path planning and dual-robot trajectory planning methodologies, pivotal for orchestrating welding operation sequences tailored to HWR. To assess the job completion and potential applications of HWR, this paper evaluates welding quality judgment and explores the humanoid robot’s utility in non-welding scenes. Conclusively, this paper identifies the exigencies confronting HWR and proffers strategic directives delineating avenues for seminal research and practical application within this burgeoning domain.

AB  - Recent global events emphasize the importance of a reliable energy supply. One way to increase energy supply security is through decentralized off-grid renewable energy systems, for which a growing number of case studies are researched. This review gives a global overview of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for these autonomous energy systems, which range from 0.03 $2021/kWh to over 1.00 $2021/kWh worldwide. The average LCOEs for 100% renewable energy systems have decreased by 9% annually between 2016 and 2021 from 0.54 $2021/kWh to 0.29 $2021/kWh, most likely due to cost reductions in renewable energy and storage technologies. This review identifies and discusses seven key reasons why LCOEs are frequently overestimated or underestimated in research, and how this can be prevented in the future. This overview can be employed to verify findings on off-grid systems, to assess where these systems might be deployed and how costs evolve.

In light of this, the present study primarily focuses on banks’s “environmental” credit products, which recent market research has exhibited significant and growing volumes. The aim is to understand which aspects of these two forms of environmental financing - Green Loans and Sustainability-Linked Loans the existing research have been analyzed. Using content analysis, we conducted a thorough literature review of academic studies. The most intriguing finding from our work is that the provision and adoption of environmental credit products has preceded the implementation of precise legislation to mitigate risks such as greenwashing. Moreover, our findings prove that most research focuses on strategy and performance while only one study covers the aspects related to organization. This research could prove to be a valuable resource for regulators, academics, and banks by providing a comprehensive and precise overview of the work done so far, highlighting the objectives, methodologies, and results achieved.

AB  - Product-Service Systems (PSS) have been recognized as potential game-changers for advancing sustainability. However, the sustainability of a PSS over traditional products and services is not automatic; it requires careful, intentional design. Despite a decade's progress in relevant literature, early-stage design assessment of a PSS – particularly from a life cycle standpoint and considering the social sustainability dimension – remains underexplored. This study introduces a framework for early-stage identification and analysis of potential environmental and social impacts within a PSS's life cycle to aid in decision-making and guide towards sustainable solutions. The framework's hotspot analysis, which combines life cycle assessment techniques, aims to pinpoint life cycle stages most susceptible to significant environmental and social impacts. Drawing on existing literature and expert evaluations, this approach offers designers preliminary insights into potential impacts, establishing a groundwork for comprehensive life cycle analysis once more detailed information on products, services, and organizational structures becomes available. The hotspot analysis not only addresses the lifecycle view of a PSS but also places emphasis on the oft-neglected social dimension of sustainability, marking an area ripe for further study. By supporting decision-making in the early design phase and encouraging scrutiny of various PSS concepts, this approach promotes the cultivation of sustainably-designed solutions.

AB  - This study introduces and evaluates a novel, integrated solar energy system for achieving sustainable and zero-energy residential buildings. The proposed system integrates photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar panels, heat pumps, electrolyzers, fuel cells, reverse osmosis desalination units, and thermal storage tanks to simultaneously supply electricity, heating, cooling, and potable water. A primary challenge in solar energy systems—the intermittency of energy production—is addressed using energy storage solutions, including hydrogen-based electrolysis and fuel cell systems, which stabilize the supply across day-night cycles. The energy system is designed to meet the energy demands of a 160-unit residential complex in San Diego, each unit covering 110 m2. A dynamic simulation over an entire year is performed using TRNSYS software. System optimization is conducted via Response Surface Methodology (RSM), targeting three objective functions: total power capacity, life cycle cost (LCC), and thermal comfort represented by the predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) index. Optimization system is based on five key decision variables: solar PVT area, fuel cell capacity, electrolyzer capacity, heat pump capacity, and hydrogen tank size. Results demonstrate that, under optimized configurations, the system achieves an annual electricity output of 29,145.8 kWh/year, an LCC of $894,228, and a PPD index of 6.8 %, fully meeting the residential complex’s electricity demand of 200 MWh/year. The results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid system in enhancing efficiency, ensuring system reliability, and mitigating environmental impacts, thus offering a scalable solution for zero-energy building applications.

AB  - In the existing literature, the importance of control methods used to manage the operation of thermal energy storage systems increased in the last years. However, the application of smart control strategies is still far to become a significant part of the available scientific publications. Within the employed techniques, model predictive control appeared as the most promising method to control thermal energy storage systems. Therefore, in this paper, the application of this control strategy is widely studied. Regarding this analysis, significant literature gaps that have to be studied more in detail are found in the current scientific publications. The main goal of this study is to find out these gaps through a bibliometric approach, identifying the key knowledge areas using both databases Web of Science and Scopus. Results show that the main knowledge gaps in the literature are the ones related with a validation of model predictive control, its implementation in smart grids, an optimized sizing and management of the physical parts of the system, an accurate weather forecasting, and to exploit as much as possible the available renewable energy resources. Moreover, the tendency in publications during the whole period, the main authors, countries, and organisations are analysed.

AB  - The emergence of deep learning over the past decade has driven the development of increasingly complex AI models, amplifying the need for Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). As AI systems grow in size and complexity, ensuring interpretability and transparency becomes essential, especially in high-stakes applications. With the rapid expansion of XAI research, addressing emerging debates and criticisms requires a comprehensive examination. This paper explores the complexities of XAI from multiple perspectives, proposing six key axes that shed light on its role in human–AI interaction and collaboration. First, it examines the imperative of XAI under the dominance of black-box AI models. Given the lack of definitional cohesion, the paper argues that XAI must be framed through the lens of audience and understanding, highlighting its different uses in AI–human interaction. The recent BLUE vs. RED XAI distinction is analyzed through this perspective. The study then addresses the criticisms of XAI, evaluating its maturity, current trajectory, and limitations in handling complex problems. The discussion then shifts to explanations as a bridge between AI models and human understanding, emphasizing the importance of usability of explanations in human–AI decision making. Key aspects such as AI reliance, human intuition, and emerging collaboration theories — including the human-algorithm centaur and co-intelligence paradigms — are explored in connection with XAI. The medical field is considered as a case study, given its extensive research on collaboration between doctors and AI through explainability. The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the maturity of XAI using three dimensions: practicality, auditability, and AI governance. Provide the final lessons learned focused on trends and questions to tackle in the near future. This is an in-depth exploration of the impact and urgency of XAI in the era of pervasive expansion of AI. Three Key reflections from this study include: (a) XAI must enhance cognitive engagement with explanations, (b) it must evolve to fully address why, what, and for what purpose explanations are needed, and (c) it plays a crucial role in building societal trust in AI. By advancing XAI in these directions, we can ensure that AI remains transparent, auditable, and accountable, and aligned with human needs.

AB  - Rigs are critical capital-intensive resources for oil and gas exploration and production operations, such as drilling, completion, and workover. The Rig Scheduling Problem (RSP) comprises deciding which rigs will serve each of the wells and when the operations must be performed. Several studies considering the theoretical and practical perspectives of the RSP are available, but no complete literature review exists. Aiming to fill this gap, we developed an extensive and systematic literature review. We propose a classification for the RSP and examine 130 studies selected after implementing a structured search and analysis protocol. The majority of the papers surveyed consider homogeneous workover rigs for onshore wells, usually employing heuristics. Moreover, we observe a trend towards addressing more complex problems involving heterogeneous fleets and more realistic assumptions through advanced analytical methods. The opportunities for further research identified include considering uncertainty, integrating the RSP with other decisions, and validating technical developments in real instances.

AB  - Agrivoltaic (AV) systems have emerged as a transformative solution to address the interrelated global challenges of food security, water conservation, and renewable energy generation. This study aims to provide a systematic review of 33 studies published between 2013 and 2023, analyzing the impacts of AV systems on microclimate regulation, evapotranspiration (ET), soil evaporation, water-use efficiency (WUE), and crop yield across diverse agricultural and climatic contexts. The findings highlight that AV systems improve WUE by 20–47 %, lower air and soil temperatures by 1–4 °C, and enhance crop resilience in water-scarce regions. However, yield reductions are observed in light-dependent crops under high shading intensities, underscoring the need for tailored designs that optimize shading intensity while balancing energy generation and agricultural productivity. Advanced technologies, such as dynamic shading systems and semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) panels, are identified as critical for maximizing AV efficiency and adaptability to specific regional needs. This study also addresses significant gaps in the literature, including the underrepresentation of tropical and arid climates, insufficient long-term ecological assessments, and the lack of comprehensive economic feasibility analyses for large-scale implementation. By integrating geographic and temporal trends, diverse methodological approaches, and innovative PV technologies, this study provides actionable research directions for optimizing AV system scalability and sustainability, advancing AV systems as a cornerstone of climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Buildings play a crucial role in human health. While past literature reviews have focused on specific aspects of building for health, like indoor environmental quality, a comprehensive understanding of healthy building strategies, especially those relevant to early-stage design, remains limited across domain areas. This study presents a systematic, cross-topic review of design strategies for healthy buildings and cities, analyzing over 100 papers across ten categories (over a decade) using a structured search. By focusing on earlier-stage solutions, the study highlights their pivotal role in shaping building performance. Our analysis reveals that research intensity varies significantly across categories, with ventilation, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality receiving the most attention. Meanwhile, while computational and simulation methods dominate research approaches, their practical implementation often falls short. Underlying data and codebases are often not made public. This review also identifies critical gaps, such as the dearth of validation of computational methods in real-world applications, the limited scalability and generalizability of many studies, a lag in the move toward open science, insufficient consideration of long-term impacts, and geographical concentration of research in developed regions.

AB  - The rapid advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, combined with the growing accumulation of plastic waste, has generated significant interest in utilizing materials derived from plastic waste and their composites within the AM industry. This paper examines the methods and approaches currently employed in recycling and blending thermoplastic waste into additive manufacturing feedstocks, aiming to enhance understanding and guide future advancements in this field. A systematic literature review including 82 papers from 2014 to 2024 was performed using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The review findings indicate that approximately 83 % of the research is concentrated in production of new materials combining various polymer waste with recycled bio-sourced materials, recycled fillers or other additives for property enhancement. The evaluation and characterization of these new materials was carry out mostly using 3D printing, predominantly employing fused filament fabrication technology (63 %). The remaining 17 % focus on the improvement of the printing quality and optimization, development or adaptation of 3D printers for the utilization of new materials, and material reprocessability. This review highlight the need of evaluating the behavior of recycled blends over multiple life cycles, the cost and environmental assessments, and primary end-use applications of these materials, including as well as further development and design of printers.

AB  - Stochastic modeling techniques, such as discrete-event and agent-based simulation, are widely used in supply chain management (SCM) for capturing real-world uncertainties. Over the last decade, data-driven approaches like machine learning (ML) have also gained prominence in SCM, employing methods such as supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL), and reinforcement learning (RL). As supply chains grow in complexity, hybrid models combining simulation (Sim) and ML are becoming increasingly common, and the field stands to gain from a structured review of this literature. Towards this, we developed the Sim-ML Literature Classification Framework, which includes a hierarchical taxonomy comprising five SC criteria, 22 Sim-ML classes and over 75 Sim-ML subclasses. We applied this framework to synthesize 99 papers, revealing significant diversity in how Sim-ML models are used to address supply chain challenges. Key findings include the recognition of the breadth of study objectives, identifying various forms of model hybridization achieved by combining discrete/continuous simulation techniques with SL, UL, and RL approaches, and the data flow mechanisms such as sequential and feedback methods employed by the simulation and ML elements of the hybrid model. Our findings also identify some gaps in the literature; for example, optimization is rarely incorporated into Sim-ML models. Also, most studies present Sim-ML models for addressing problems in general supply chains, likely due to the lack of access to industrial data. The review also highlights that Industry 4.0 technologies, such as digital twins and blockchain, are underrepresented in current research, as are topics like sustainability and transportation. These gaps suggest significant opportunities for future research. We provide guidelines for practitioners on applying Sim-ML models to manage supply chain drivers, mitigate the impact of disruptions, and integrate emerging technologies. Our review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in leveraging Sim-ML approaches in SCM.

AB  - Quantum computing and digital twins are two technologies that have the potential to revolutionize industries. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis on the academic landscape of these research areas. The objective of this chapter is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of academic publications related to quantum computing and digital twins, aiming to ascertain research trends, collaborative networks, and thematic focus areas. The analysis reveals that quantum computing research primarily concentrates on algorithmic development and cryptography, whereas digital twin research focuses on the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial applications. Notably, the study uncovers a limited yet expanding body of work at the intersection of quantum computing and digital twins, indicating an emerging multidisciplinary research avenue. The chapter identifies key players in these fields, discusses the historical evolution of these technologies, and underscores the need for increased multidisciplinary collaboration to unlock their full potential. These findings provide a foundational understanding to guide future research in both domains. Future studies could explore the synergies between quantum computing and digital twins, particularly in sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, and smart cities.

AB  - Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) have shown great potential to replace conventional heating and cooling systems in many regions. They also have a significant contribution to the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper aims to investigate the advancements, applications, research trends related to GSHPs, and the challenges and barriers that face their development based on a bibliometric analysis. The results show that in recent years, a considerable growth in GSHP’s research has been recognized, with a focus on heating more than cooling, which is due to the fact that GSHP is more suitable for cold regions. The major part of the research done on GSHPs in relation to the SDGs focused on SDG 7, followed by SDG 13. This is mainly due to the direct relation between GSHPs and the environment. However, it was also found that GSHPs have a crucial contribution to the other SDGs, but there was insufficient work dedicated to investigating such relations. Based on the interpretation of the bibliometric analysis, it was deduced that most of the challenges and barriers to GSHPs are related to the capital cost, groundwater contamination, regulations, subsidies, and incentives.

AB  - Purpose
The evolution of technology from the most recent industrial age to the technology era better known as Industry 4.0 resulted in greater demand for horizontal, vertical and end-to-end digital integration. Prior studies show that Industry 4.0 adoption majorly influences the sustainability aspects in a supply chain network. The purpose of this paper is to identify the Industry 4.0 enablers of supply chain sustainability and further attempt to propose a research framework to bridge the theoretical gaps.
Design/methodology/approach
In this research study, the authors have used a systematic literature review methodology in the field of Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain management. The list of papers was downloaded from Scopus (www.scopus.com) database. Through strict screening, only journal papers were selected for conducting the review of the literature.
Findings
The review brings out some interesting findings which will be helpful for the research community. There have been limited research in the area of managing supply chain network sustainability through Industry 4.0 technologies. The authors found only 10 papers out of a total of 53 papers which emphasize on smart manufacturing, smart production system, smart warehouse management system, smart logistics and sustainability. Most of the previous research studies have ignored the social aspects of supply chain sustainability. Finally, the authors identified 13 key enablers of Industry 4.0 playing an important role in driving supply chain sustainability.
Practical implications
The strategies for Industry 4.0 should be refined and detailed to develop economic and social systems that can act flexibly to sudden changes in the system. Top management must be convinced for prioritizing investment support and creating a system that can facilitate technology convergence. Managers must also act on new models of employment and frame plans to continuously improve the system. In addition, managers must focus on establishing a collaborative platform to facilitate high-tech research and developments. Finally, it is essential to develop a performance management system for monitoring all actions in the supply chain network.
Originality/value
Integrating two independent subjects is the uniqueness of the current study. Here, Industry 4.0 and supply chain sustainability have been integrated to build the research framework, and in such a process, the authors have extended the existing knowledge base.

AB  - Dynamic scheduling plays a pivotal role in smart manufacturing by enabling real-time adjustments to production schedules, thereby enhancing system resilience and promoting sustainability. By efficiently responding to disruptions, dynamic scheduling maintains productivity and stability, while also reducing resource consumption and environmental impact through optimized operations and the potential integration of renewable energy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a cutting-edge artificial intelligence technique, shows promise in tackling the complexities of production scheduling, particularly in solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its potential, a comprehensive study of DRL's impact on dynamic scheduling, especially regarding system resilience and sustainability, has been lacking. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a systematic review of DRL-based dynamic scheduling focusing on resilience and sustainability. Through an analysis of two decades of literature, key application scenarios of DRL in dynamic scheduling are examined, and specific indicators are defined to assess the resilience and sustainability of these systems. The findings demonstrate DRL's effectiveness across various production domains, surpassing traditional rule-based and metaheuristic algorithms, particularly in enhancing resilience. However, a significant gap remains in addressing sustainability aspects such as energy flexibility, resource utilization, and human-centric social impacts. This paper also explores current technical challenges, including multi-objective and multi-agent optimization, and proposes future research directions to better integrate resilience and sustainability in DRL-based dynamic scheduling, with an emphasis on real-world application.

AB  - The growing interconnectivity of transportation infrastructures amplifies system interdependencies and significantly influences system resilience during disruptive events. While these dependencies can offer backup routes and ensure service continuity, they also heighten the risk of widespread disruptions following a single failure. This paper provides a thorough examination of the literature on interdependency and resilience in transportation systems. The discussion begins with an exploration of the forms of interdependency in both single-modal and multi-modal transportation systems, delving into their definitions and the methodologies employed for their modeling. Subsequently, the paper analyzes the dual-edged impact of interdependency on transportation resilience, considering both its potential to enhance robustness and its propensity to exacerbate the consequences of disruptions. The review concludes with an assessment of the current limitations in understanding and addressing these issues, proposing future research directions aimed at developing more resilient transportation systems.

AB  - Seawater desalination (SWD) can partially mitigate the increasing freshwater needs globally. Although, SWD is multifaceted and involves processes with environmental and economic challenges, research is often analyzed through Literature Reviews (LRs) in specific contexts that may miss general trends. Bibliometric Analyzes (BAs), however, provide researchers with an overview through Co-occurrence Networks (CNs), Strategic Diagrams (SDs), Thematic Subnetworks (TSs), and Thematic Evolution Diagrams (TEDs). Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy. Furthermore, RO remains the leading technique despite high energy demands. Solar desalination shows promise but faces cost and scalability challenges. Environmental and economic concerns are discussed, as well as emerging solutions regarding, solar desalination, blue energy, “blue carbon”, and zero liquid discharge. Research gaps include fouling effects and pretreatment incorporation in optimizations are also highlighted.

AB  - Globalization, growing population, and advancements in technology have catapulted the pollution issue to be a serious threat to the existence of most living beings on Earth. Consequently, sustainability has emerged as a key concern for policymakers worldwide. On a global basis, the release of several toxicants into the environment due to industrialization and community expansion is of serious concern. Enhanced and detrimental pollution is caused by dye, and this is scary as they are harmful, cannot be degraded easily, and they accumulate. To effectively mitigate the formation of such dyes in the water bodies, among several alternate pathways, biochemical adsorption has been thoroughly researched for its practical utility. Given its promising attributes, such as economic feasibility, accessibility, and compliance with environmental standards, this review article fosters the integration of three key dimensions in the mentioned research sub-theme. These refer to (a) systematic evaluation of various chitosan MOF composites with the MOF structures such as ZIF, UIO-66, MIL, and HKUST MOFs and their hybrid forms such as MOF-membranes, MOF-sponges, gels that were tailored for the dye capture purpose; (b) systematic assessment of the synthesis procedures and reaction mechanisms involved in chitosan MOF and other composite derivatives (hybrid materials) for the removal of toxic dyes from wastewater solutions and (3) assessment of the desorption efficiency, eluting solution efficacy and reusability of the chitosan MOF and other derivatives. Accordingly, future research directions have also been presented in the article for the development of efficient and scalable adsorption-based capture technologies for pollution-free environment realization.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming popular in Additive Manufacturing (AM) due to their ability to create virtual replicas of physical components of AM machines, which helps in real-time production monitoring. Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes. Considering this opportunity, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DTs in AM by addressing the following four research questions: (1) What are the key types of DTs used in AM and their specific applications? (2) What are the recent developments and implementations of DTs? (3) How are DTs employed in process improvement and hybrid manufacturing? (4) How are DTs integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies? By discussing current applications and techniques, we aim to offer a better understanding and potential future research directions for researchers and practitioners in AM and DTs.

AB  - The modernization of Chinese higher education relies heavily on fostering innovative work behavior (IWB) among university teachers. However, the crucial role of non-intellectual and external factors has often been overlooked, contributing to insufficient innovative outcomes. Drawing on self-determination theory and social exchange theory, this study develops a research model where career calling (CC) and talent policy (TP) serve as independent variables, IWB as the dependent variable, work engagement (WE) as a mediating variable, and artificial intelligence (AI) as a moderating variable to explore effective ways to stimulate IWB. The authors conducted a two-wave online questionnaire survey among 252 university teachers in China, analyzing the data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings reveal that CC and TP are significantly associated with WE, which, in turn, positively influences IWB. Moreover, AI acts as a moderating variable, strengthening the relationship between WE and IWB. This study makes valuable contributions to the literature on IWB, enriches the theoretical foundations of CC andTP in higher education contexts, and offers practical recommendations for leveraging AI strategies within the sector.

AB  - Autonomous and cooperative elements of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) rely on the interconnection of digital and physical components to enable intelligent and profitable production processes. However, this interconnectedness increases system complexity, heterogeneity, and unpredictability. To address these interactions, decrease complexity, and enhance resilience within such systems, identifying the appropriate Design Parameters (DPs) is crucial. DPs are solutions that fulfill higher-level Functional Requirements (FRs) in the design of CPPSs. Despite numerous literature on CPPSs, less attention has been given to exploring resilience-related FRs and corresponding DPs. This paper presents a comprehensive review to identify and categorize the DPs discussed in the scientific literature that enhance CPPSs resilience. The identified DPs are classified into physical and digital solutions and an integration of both. The findings indicate that the Industrial Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twins are the most implemented DPs to fulfill FRs, thereby providing resilience capabilities in CPPSs.

AB  - The deployment of solar energy is among the key strategies to counterbalance the increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas, contributing to a sustainable built environment. In this context, interactive platforms such as solar atlas, mapping, and cadasters play a primary role by enabling the evaluation of urban solar energy potential. Solar cadasters, in particular, facilitate user interaction for early exploration and pre-design of solar installations. This study presents a comprehensive − non-exhaustive − database of solar cadasters, focusing on interaction, accuracy, and degree of customization of solar data. The scale and level of detail of the geometry model, as well as the visualization of solar metrics on analyzed surfaces, are investigated. Solar cadasters mostly investigate the urban scale, with a medium–high level of detail of the geometry models and a gradient visualization of the solar data. Additionally, the functionality of solar cadasters is examined, identifying design input parameters and the estimated energy, technical, economic, and environmental metrics. Based on the results, future solar cadasters should enhance the calculation of the building solar potential, with a specific focus on facades, taking into account inter-building reflections and material properties. Additionally, user experience, data visualization, accessibility, and interoperability of solar cadasters with urban planning tools should be improved. This research is relevant for developing informed decision-making to accelerate urban clean-energy transitions, support innovation, increase public and private stakeholder engagement on solar energy systems adoption, and contribute to achieve targeted Sustainable Development Goals in high- and low-income countries.

AB  - High-Speed Rail (HSR) systems represent a significant advancement in modern transportation. They offer rapid, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional rail, air travel and road transportation. Even if high-speed trains appeared approximately in the middle of the previous century, several aspects concerning safety remain. This study aims to comprehensively review the scientific literature related to the safety issues of high-speed railways. A bibliometric analysis was carried out utilizing 2358 publications from the last two decades (2004–2023) to understand better the existing research on HSR and safety. Future trends and thematic areas of research are identified and analyzed. Chinese researchers and universities have led the total number of current publications related to the context of HSR safety. While most of the publications come from Chinese institutions, a significant international collaboration can be identified. The main areas of research on HSR and safety can be classified into four main clusters based on the keywords co-occurrence analysis and are related to risk management, structural dynamics and resilience in railway systems, geotechnical engineering and tunnelling and maintenance technologies. Researchers and policymakers can use the results of this study to better understand the dynamics of scientific research in the field of high-speed railways and safety and make decisions about future directions and funding priorities.

AB  - In the face of climate change, a major challenge is to inform and guide long-term climate change adaptation planning under deep uncertainty, while aiming at transformative change. Normative futures studies approaches, such as participatory backcasting, visioning and transition management, are increasingly applied, but their potential for climate change adaptation research and practice remains undervalued. This paper aims to advance the potential of backcasting in climate adaptation, by comparing various climate change adaptation studies that have used backcasting or visioning approaches. A framework has been further developed and applied to evaluate 10 cases in Africa, Europe and North America, using four dimensions: (i) inputs andsettings; (ii) process and methods (iii) results, and (iv), impact. Our evaluation provides key insights into the use and further development of backcasting for climate adaptation. Key elements to add are advanced system modeling, robust elements, pathway switching and hybrid pathways, enhancing participation of marginal groups, and contributing to impact by facilitating the utilization of results and knowledge in practice and decision making.

AB  - Due to many serious wide-influence disruptions during the last few years, the stability of the manufacturing shop floors’ performance has suffered significantly. Therefore, the companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have shifted from a stability to a resilience approach. The purpose of the research is to examine from the SMEs’ perspective, how the Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) main characteristics comply with the requirements for a resilient system. The literature review method was adapted to collect SMEs’ requirements for complex digital systems. The collected requirements were generalized and evaluated from the resilience components’ perspective. The SMEs’ requirements were further analyzed using the House of Quality method, where the importance of CPPS’s main characteristics to fulfill the SMEs’ requirements for resilient manufacturing systems were assessed and ranked. The findings of the study show a wide variety of SMEs’ requirements. The most crucial requirement is related to the management of know-how and training in a company. Technical harmonization was identified as the characteristic that best fulfills the requirements for a resilient manufacturing system from the SMEs’ perspective. These findings illustrate the relationships between SMEs’ requirements, resilient systems, and CPPS. The results contribute to a better understanding of the SMEs’ needs for complex digital systems and the influences between CPPS characteristics and resilient system requirements from the SMEs’ perspective.

AB  - The accelerating integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems marks a critical step toward low-carbon, efficient, and resilient energy infrastructure. Central to this transition is the development of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), which present various design, control, and operational challenges. This review offers a comprehensive evaluation of EV and RES integration, with a particular focus on EVCS infrastructure, power converter topologies, and system-level coordination. A bibliometric analysis of 1,725 Scopus-indexed documents from the past two decades was conducted using VOSviewer to uncover research trends, thematic clusters, and collaboration patterns. In parallel, technical aspects such as grid impacts, energy management models, charging strategies, and communication protocols are critically examined. The study further categorizes EVCS converter architectures and outlines key selection criteria based on application needs. Special emphasis is placed on interoperability standards, smart charging frameworks, and the deployment of intelligent, user-centric EVCS systems. While interest in this domain has grown rapidly, the review identifies persistent gaps in interdisciplinary innovation and the practical application of emerging technologies. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions in AI-driven optimization, grid control, hybrid energy storage, and real-time integration strategies. The findings aim to support researchers, engineers, and policymakers in advancing scalable, intelligent, and sustainable EV–RES-powered energy systems.

This systematic review evaluates progress in hydrogen, biomass, biogas, and solar photovoltaics (PV) and emphasizes their significance in hybrid energy frameworks. A thorough analysis of 174 research articles was performed using VOSviewer, categorizing the literature into seven themes: “Renewable Energy Technologies and Transition”, “Advanced Bioenergy and Optimization”, “Integrated Energy Systems and Hydrogen Technologies”, “Energy Systems Management and Optimization”, “Sustainable Energy Fundamentals”, “Innovations in Hydrogen and Sustainable Energy”, and “Biohydrogen and Biomass Technologies”. The review results revealed that integrating hydrogen, advancing bioenergy, implementing AI-driven energy management, and utilizing hybrid storage solutions are crucial for enhancing energy efficiency and grid stability. High costs, intermittency challenges, and regulatory hurdles hamper large-scale implementation. Addressing these issues through policy initiatives and innovative technologies can expedite the rollout of HRES, promoting a clean, resilient, and energy-secure future.

AB  - The increasing need to address climate change has intensified efforts to promote green transportation options, such as cycling and public transit. Over the past few decades, gamification—the integration of game-like elements into non-game contexts to motivate and engage people in adopting new behaviors—has emerged as a strategy to encourage the use of sustainable transportation. This literature review examines how gamification has been used to drive the adoption of green transportation. Following the PRISMA methodology, 49 documents were initially screened, leading to a final selection of 14 papers. We analyze the stakeholders involved, the game elements, the external rewards (e.g., financial incentives), and persuasive strategies employed, and the overall effectiveness of these initiatives both in the short and in the long term. We also explore the relationship between game elements and persuasive approaches, offering insights into how they are related. Finally, we propose a research agenda that emphasizes the exploration of different game elements and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to designing gameful systems that promote sustainable behaviors.

AB  - Background
The benefits of smart contracts (SCs) for sustainable health care are a relatively recent topic that has gathered attention given its relationship with trust and the advantages of decentralization, immutability, and traceability introduced in health care. Nevertheless, more studies need to explore the role of SCs in this sector based on the frameworks propounded in the literature that reflect business logic that has been customized, automatized, and prioritized, as well as system trust. This study addressed this lacuna.
Objective
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of SCs in health care based on reviewing the frameworks propounded in the literature.
Methods
A structured literature review was performed based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) principles. One database—Web of Science (WoS)—was selected to avoid bias generated by database differences and data wrangling. A quantitative assessment of the studies based on machine learning and data reduction methodologies was complemented with a qualitative, in-depth, detailed review of the frameworks propounded in the literature.
Results
A total of 70 studies, which constituted 18.7% (70/374) of the studies on this subject, met the selection criteria and were analyzed. A multiple correspondence analysis—with 74.44% of the inertia—produced 3 factors describing the advances in the topic. Two of them referred to the leading roles of SCs: (1) health care process enhancement and (2) assurance of patients’ privacy protection. The first role included 6 themes, and the second one included 3 themes. The third factor encompassed the technical features that improve system efficiency. The in-depth review of these 3 factors and the identification of stakeholders allowed us to characterize the system trust in health care SCs. We assessed the risk of coverage bias, and good percentages of overlap were obtained—66% (49/74) of PubMed articles were also in WoS, and 88.3% (181/205) of WoS articles also appeared in Scopus.
Conclusions
This comprehensive review allows us to understand the relevance of SCs and the potentiality of their use in patient-centric health care that considers more than technical aspects. It also provides insights for further research based on specific stakeholders, locations, and behaviors.

AB  - Logistics is critical in every company's supply chain (SC), and outsourcing helps businesses concentrate on their core competencies. Third-party logistics (3 PL) or logistics service providers (LSPs) assist businesses in cutting costs while improving performance, sustainability, and revenue. Logistics evaluation and LSPs choice are complicated and critical components of value delivery. This study aims to review logistics outsourcing literature to understand the trends, prospects, factors, and strategies used in logistics companies' outsourcing choices. This work examines the literature on LSPs selection published between 2010 and 2023. This paper uses VOSviewer (version 1.6.19) to visualize the relationships. Pricing, timely shipment, service quality, reliability, agility, technology, and consumer feedback are the most commonly utilized, whereas societal and environmental factors are seldom used. The study comprises journal publications, the year, selection criteria, and assessment methodologies. Numerous scholars have discovered and employed many critical selection criteria. Many investigators have also embraced multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies, and their fuzzy form is widely used. In conclusion, recommendations for theorists and managers, limits, and future directions for research are offered.

AB  - Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) often represents centuries of empirical observation and adaptation to specific ecological conditions, which is relevant to meaningful nature-human relations. Yet, TEK is rarely taken into account. This study examines the role of TEK-based agriculture in promoting adaptation and resilience to climate change in the mountain agricultural systems of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region. Through an extensive literature review, it identifies and synthesizes TEK-based agricultural practices, with a focus on soil and fertility management, strategies to manage agroecological disruptions and agroforestry. The findings indicate that these practices align with the climate change adaptation priorities of HKH countries, particularly in developing water- and nutrient-efficient crop cultivation systems and enhancing soil organic matter. While TEK-based agricultural methods can support regional climate change adaptation and resilience, the alteration or loss of traditional practices due to socio-economic factors may worsen the impacts of climate change. Therefore, recognizing and validating TEK within regional and local adaptation frameworks are essential for maintaining the resilience of traditional agriculture in the HKH region.

AB  - In socially-embedded tasks like planning the location of wind farms, certain evaluation methods have been used to establish the viability of decision support tools. These methods often consider the usability and technical functionality of decision support tools, users' tasks, and other important characteristics. However, such evaluations provide only a partial assessment of the prototype design process because the perception of usefulness, ease of use on tasks, and common barriers to use, from the point of view of the people who use the tool, are not always sufficiently integrated. The study in this article employs the focus group methodology to evaluate AB–WINDEC – a place-specific decision support tool designed to match the socio-technical requirements of stakeholders involved in wind farm placement planning in Alberta. In this context, the main purpose of the focus group was to elicit real-world perspectives from stakeholders who will eventually use the tool. The results of the study suggest that AB–WINDEC can be useful for educational purposes, public engagement, high-level analysis, risk assessment, and collaboration between wind energy decision makers and stakeholders. Feedback from the stakeholders also led to additional requirements and insight on how the design of the prototype needs to be modified to increase its usefulness and ease of use. Further, the findings provided relevant information on social considerations and potential barriers that can influence the acceptance and use of AB-WINDEC in real-world conditions.

AB  - In the age of disruption, it is important for companies to have a supported product development in order to be able to bring complex products such as manufacturing systems to the market. Systems Engineering methods support these product development processes. However, because product development processes vary from company to company, methods need to be adapted to the company's needs and processes. In our paper, we examine the topic of Method Engineering (ME). Three main research questions were investigated. First, what is ME and how is it defined in literature? Second, what is the terminology associated with ME? And third, how can a standard method be adapted to stakeholder needs and tasks? Is there a universal approach? To answer the research questions, we have conducted a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database. The results provide a useful overview of the state of the art in ME. We have structured the results into definitions of the key terms, challenges, advantages, and prerequisites of ME. Finally, we present typical approaches described in the literature. The results provide an overview of the field of ME as well as information that can help companies to support their product development methodically. The results form the basis for industrial companies to understand the procedure of ME.

To ensure seamless interactions and interoperability, a key challenge is designing the SoS architecture, particularly the interfaces between interconnected business models. This research highlights the importance of interface design in SoS Engineering (SoSE) to enable desirable emergent functionalities, like circularity. We conduct a systematic literature review to identify key interoperability and interface design approaches, proposing a contract-based, multi-level, multi-perspective framework to support circular system engineering. The case of a CE of photovoltaic panels illustrates the potential benefits for the engineering of circular systems and the business model design of a focal company.

AB  - Integrating heat pumps and adopting building envelope retrofit (BER) measures is vital for decarbonising the built environment. This paper systematically reviews modelling approaches for these technologies within 84 local energy system optimisation studies. Our findings show that most studies simplify heat pump operation using a constant coefficient of performance (COP), perfect modulation, or a fixed heating capacity. While existing methods account for temperature-dependent COPs, only a few studies include more advanced approaches considering additional impacts. Two main approaches for modelling BER measures are identified: pre-defined retrofit sets with exogenous heat demand or an integrated retrofit selection with endogenous heat demand. While the pre-defined approach offers lower computational effort, it limits the BER solution space. The integrated approach achieves the opposite: a wider solution space but higher complexity. Moreover, only two studies consider the impact of BER measures on the heat supply temperature, an essential link between retrofit measures and heat pump efficiency. Based on our qualitative review, we derive recommendations for energy system modellers. For modelling heat pumps, we recommend using a temperature-dependent COP and heating capacity, as well as a lower modulation limit. Regarding BER measures, the integrated approach should be used for smaller scales (single buildings) while the pre-defined sets are suitable for larger scales. Finally, we propose a research agenda to address limitations and gaps in the current modelling approaches, such as addressing the performance gap between existing COP estimations and heat pump field performance and including a more detailed method for the heat supply temperature.

AB  - Offshore energy system integration is particularly important for realising a rapid and cost-effective low-carbon energy transition in the North Sea region. Effective implementation of strategies that require collaboration between countries, developers and operators must be underpinned by robust and comprehensive modelling results. Intra-system interactions and diversity of sectors needed to facilitate the energy transition must be adequately captured within whole-system models. Historically, consideration of the offshore energy environment within macro-scale models has been supplementary to the onshore system. However, increased deployment of offshore wind, focus on geological storage for energy security, and technological development and investment in hydrogen and carbon storage projects highlights the importance of expanding the role of the offshore system within modelling. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of energy system integration challenges within offshore system modelling, and how these define the requirements of the employed methodology. The findings suggest large-scale offshore system modelling studies typically include few energy vectors, limited spatial resolution and simplified network flow characteristics. Despite the North Sea focus, these challenges reflect fundamental barriers within large-scale offshore energy system modelling and thus extend to similar offshore contexts globally. Key approaches are identified to maximise sectoral and technological diversity, while maintaining sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to suitably represent the evolving offshore system, are identified. We make concrete suggestions for future work in this field, based on identified best practice among the reviewed literature.

AB  - The industrial sector is crucial in optimizing energy consumption and achieving sustainable manufacturing. This study reviews the potential for integrating solar energy within the manufacturing industry using Discrete Event Simulation (DES). DES is motivated by its ability to model complex, variable processes and improve decision-making in energy integration scenarios. A systematic literature review using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was conducted, focusing on existing methods and practices for energy utilization in the industrial context, particularly integrating renewable sources like solar energy. Thirty articles were comprehensively reviewed and categorized into three main research domains: energy efficiency, management, and consumption. A significant gap was identified in the literature regarding the integration of solar energy into DES models for industrial applications. This study highlights this gap and proposes research directions to address it, including incorporating solar variability forecasting models and evaluating the impact of solar PV integration on grid stability, power quality, and congestion management. The intermittent nature of solar power generation and demand variability are critical aspects that DES can effectively address, helping to quantify the matching of supply and demand. This research aims to contribute to developing a more sustainable and resilient industrial energy landscape.

AB  - The rapid digital transformation of transportation systems has elevated Extended Reality (XR) technologies—including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—as critical tools. XR improves safety, optimizes mobility, and enhances human-machine interaction.This study presents a bibliometric analysis and thematic review of XR research in transportation. We analyzed 283 Scopus-indexed publications from 2014 to 2024 using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and Python-based libraries. The results show an annual publication growth rate of 18.15%. Cornell University, the University of Glasgow, and Delft University of Technology emerged as leading institutional contributors. National leadership was dominated by the United States, Germany, and China.Thematic mapping identified key areas such as autonomous vehicle validation, pedestrian-AV interaction, AI-driven traffic simulation, immersive driver training, and AR navigation for rail and maritime transport. Keyword analysis emphasized research focuses including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Vehicles, Pedestrian Safety, Mixed Reality, Traffic Simulation, and Human Factors.Despite this progress, significant challenges persist. Studies often lack ecological validity, demographic diversity, scalability, cybersecurity resilience, and ethical transparency. Most XR applications remain confined to laboratory settings with limited real-world validation or cross-cultural generalizability.To address these gaps, we propose integrated frameworks and a strategic research agenda. We emphasize ecological realism, cognitive-adaptive XR designs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical governance.This study consolidates existing knowledge and outlines future research directions. XR is positioned as a transformative and human-centered technology, crucial for advancing safer, smarter, and more inclusive transportation ecosystems.

AB  - Environmental sensing is crucial for the effective operation of mobile robots, particularly on construction sites where conditions can change rapidly. While some studies have implemented different sensing technologies independently for autonomous mobile robot navigation, comprehensive studies on applicable sensors and technologies for dynamic construction environments, particularly for enhancing productivity and safety, are lacking. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of environmental sensing technologies for mobile construction robots, assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability in the dynamic construction environment. Utilizing a combination of scientometric analysis and a critical review, three themes—vision-based sensing, localization and mapping, and autonomous navigation and path planning, which form the main sensing systems for the operation of autonomous mobile robots—were identified and analyzed. The review also identified and evaluated the different sensor technologies that facilitate environmental sensing. This paper also highlights significant research gaps and provides recommendations for future research studies.

AB  - Pursuing sustainability implies setting a multitude of open-ended goals to address environmental and socioeconomic issues today as well as those for future generations. The circular economy (CE) paradigm appears more focused regarding goals and agency to address environmental issues by using the economic system. However, companies and governments aiming to operationalize CE in practice, it has been claimed, will face six key challenges limiting the CE “net sustainability impact” potential. This work focuses on the challenges for manufacturers to adopt and operationalize CE for their business. The two key levers for manufacturers to navigate on their path from the linear (take-make-dispose) to a sustainable CE are innovating and designing of the business model and of their products. To date, however, understanding the role of product design in developing circular business models has received little attention in research. This review article builds upon the CE literature foundation, including definitions, challenges, and business modeling frameworks needed to better understand the role of product design. Building on the work of several highly cited CE-centric literature reviews and voices in research and industry, we selected and merged complementing frameworks: Slowing-Closing-Narrowing, Circular Design, and the Circular Business Model Innovation framework. To understand how to put these frameworks into practice, we analyzed CE's links with electric vehicle and white goods research and industry perspectives respectively and collectively. The review and analysis of CE and selected industries’ research was supported by a co-occurrence keyword analysis of 5,960 most cited papers in CE as well as the two product categories, electric vehicles and white goods. The analysis indicated limited maturity and linkage of circular business models and role of product design toward a CE in the research literature for the product categories. This result corroborated the knowledge gap and guided our focus in searching for further research and industry clues. We structured the clues of interest that were specific to or common across product categories and industries, using the integrated framework to visualize our Design for X conclusion. The merged framework visualizes how paths toward CE by design and logic of value creation, delivery, and capturing may differ. To conclude, the authors’ own experience and literature examples from relevant industry-leading and start-up companies are used to apply the framework and reveal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Future research and industry experiments focused on the circular business models based on product service systems and design for CE strategies identified, will be needed to test and extend the framework to other product categories and industry sectors.

AB  - This study explored how low-threshold, XR-enhanced maker environments can support preservice teachers’ (PSTs) engagement with computational thinking (CT) practices and perceptions. Using a scaffolded, three-week module built around Roblox Studio, non–computer science PSTs engaged in iterative game design activities progressing from paper prototypes to storyboard rule maps and interactive 3D builds. Findings suggest that design tasks encouraged shifts from surface-level CT definitions to more applied reasoning, particularly in decomposition and algorithmic thinking during storyboard development. However, participants encountered new challenges during 3D implementation, including spatial logic demands and limited debugging fluency. Reflections highlighted frequent micro-debug cycles and collaboration as key supports, even when such processes were not fully visible in final artifacts. While many PSTs remained hesitant about coding, most recognized transferable skills—such as perseverance, creativity, and empathy—as relevant to their future teaching. These results highlight the promise and complexity of XR maker spaces as a bridge between conceptual CT understanding and authentic classroom application. Implications include the need for scaffolded supports targeting spatial reasoning, rule-system translation, and reflective design dispositions in CT-focused teacher education.

AB  - Within a circular bioeconomy, biodegradable bioplastics (BBPs) have been promoted in fast-moving consumer goods to contribute towards closed-loop material flows. Consumers play a key role as enablers of these flows, provided they accept, understand and dispose of BBPs appropriately. Informed by focus groups, a framework combining multiple behavioural and design theories was developed to identify and structure systemic factors influencing the flow of BBPs through the consumption phase, with a focus on disposal. An exploratory network analysis based on a survey of 457 and 284 participants from two universities in the United Kingdom and the United States was then conducted to explore the interplay between factors and intentions to dispose of BBPs in different waste streams. Access to adequate organic waste infrastructure and pre-existing knowledge of BBP terminology and disposal routes were most strongly associated with intentions to dispose of BBPs alongside food waste. Mapping and facilitating consumer behaviour in tackling BBP waste is pivotal in designing sustainable systems for these materials.

AB  - The expansion of photovoltaic systems emphasizes the crucial requirement for effective operations and maintenance, drawing insights from advanced maintenance approaches evident in the wind industry. This review systematically explores the existing literature on the management of photovoltaic operation and maintenance. Through the integration of bibliometric analysis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, 186 articles are selected for further comprehensive review. The selected articles are examined and categorized into four interconnected research domains: maintenance strategies, performance indicators, degradation modeling, and maintenance optimization and planning. The presented analysis underscores the importance of integrating maintenance strategies to enhance system effectiveness. It also emphasizes the necessity of a systematic approach that integrates reliability assessment with economic and technical considerations to optimize maintenance planning and enhance system availability and resource efficiency. This aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy, while also ensuring grid security. Furthermore, the study identifies gaps and proposes avenues for improvement, recommending a shift towards prognostic approaches and the advancement of predictive maintenance in photovoltaic systems. Key suggestions also include customizing metrics for large installations, implementing adaptive protocols that move away from traditional component-centric scheduling, and using reinforcement learning to prioritize risk and optimize long-term performance. Compared to previous reviews focusing on specific maintenance elements, this work provides a broader perspective by incorporating planning and organizational factors into the maintenance discussion.

The design of software systems plays a crucial role in mitigating cybersecurity incidents. Security by Design (SbD) aims to ensure foundational security throughout the design process. However, it lacks a precise interdisciplinary definition. Comparing it with Privacy by Design (PbD), which has seen more conceptual development, highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of SbD.
Objectives
This study systematically searches and reviews relevant definitions of SbD in comparison with PbD.
Method
Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of SbD and PbD definitions, searching ACM Digital Library, EBSCO Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science. A total of 46 studies were included, identifying 86 definitions. Thirteen themes were identified, including ontology, object of protection, outcome to avoid, means of implementation, added value, and focus of the definition.
Results
Definitions varied in their descriptions of SbD and PbD, the objects of protection, outcomes to avoid, means of implementation, and lifecycle focus. PbD definitions adopted a rights-based approach, anchored in Ann Cavoukian's principles and an interdisciplinary perspective.
Discussion
SbD and PbD definitions lack clarity and uniformity. PbD is better defined, while SbD lacks anchorage and has varied approaches. Both should protect individuals and organizations, address cyber-attacks, and be implemented early in the development process. PbD is more comprehensive, involving technology and organization, while SbD focuses mainly on the technical product. PbD is associated with recognized rights, but the connection between SbD and human rights is unclear. Future research should clarify the specific value protected by SbD, adopt principles from PbD, and take an interdisciplinary approach.

KW  - Maturity assessment
AB  - The emergence of advanced digital tools such as building information modelling (BIM) has transformed the concept of building management in the construction sector. Despite the promising benefits of BIM in terms of successful project deliveries and enhanced building performance, construction firms struggle to view assets from the perspective of a whole asset life cycle context, and consequently struggle to derive their full potentials via BIM, especially in the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase. One of the fundamental reasons behind this challenge is the lack of empirical understanding of what information should be collected to support efficient and effective operation and maintenance management. Various BIM capability maturity models have been proposed to support BIM integrations into O&M management, but most of these models fail to capture detailed information requirements (IRs). Furthermore, there is limited insights regarding the prioritisations of these IRs to guide construction firms and asset owners towards operational competitiveness and excellence. To address these gaps, this study aims to develop a BIM and O&M maturity assessment model (BIM and O&M MM) by drawing on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) concept, and utilising Delphi technique and maturity grids. The developed tool enables asset owners and managers to assess BIM and O&M integration maturity of built assets, based on a five-level maturity scheme across 21 IRs. To ensure effectiveness and practicality of the tool, 22 experts assessed the tool, and the results indicate its ability to succinctly measure the maturity level of BIM and O&M integration, thereby enabling construction managers and asset owners to identify areas of strengths and deficiencies for prioritising capital investments. The BIM and O&M MM ensures stakeholder alignment and addresses real-world O&M challenges. It enhances data consistency, optimised long-term asset management, data-driven decision-making, and provides a foundation for future research and technology integration.

AB  - Blockchain technologies are increasingly recognized as a transformative force across industries, offering potential solutions for information management, data security, and operational efficiency improvement. However, integration into the healthcare sector faces significant barriers, ranging from technical challenges to organizational resistance. In this study, a methodology is proposed that examines these critical barriers through a comprehensive analysis of 3265 academic papers and derives actionable solutions from 1566 patents published between 2016 and 2023. This approach bridges the gap between identifying challenges and implementing solutions. Using the “Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)”, twelve critical adoption challenges are analyzed, while Top2Vec-based topic modeling identifies innovations that best address the ranked barriers. In addition to this, the proposed ‘healthcare ecosphere’ knowledge map serves as a comprehensive tool to analyze key stakeholders, their interactions, and the alignment of adoption barriers in solution spaces. The findings show that innovations in blockchain technologies are heavily concentrated in areas such as data security and application functionalities, whereas other critical domains—such as consensus mechanisms, governance, and regulatory frameworks—remain underexplored, pointing to opportunities for growth and development. The mapping of barriers to solutions provides practical guidance for healthcare providers, policymakers, and technologists seeking to implement the blockchain technologies effectively.
