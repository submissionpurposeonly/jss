AB  - The recent scientific focus on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has stemmed from their recognized genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. This systematic review seeks to evaluate the nexus between exposure to water sources contaminated with PAHs and the associated cancer risk among global populations, encompassing both children and adults. Web of Science (WoS), Cochrane Library, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched following the PRISMA guidelines, until December 31, 2023. Quality assessment of the selected studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The increased lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) attributed to PAH exposure through ingestion and dermal absorption was thoroughly examined across diverse age groups. After extensive searching, screening, and eligibility, 30 articles were included in this review, which was conducted in different parts of the world, including Nigeria (n = 11), China (n = 7), India (n = 4), Iran (n = 3), South Africa (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Colombia (n = 1), and Iraq (n = 1). Our analysis underscores Nigeria's alarming prevalence of PAH contamination in its rivers, groundwaters, and seawater. Remarkably, the highest cancer risk was identified among children and adults, notably in proximity to the Atlas Cove jetty (seawater) and various Nigerian rivers. This elevated risk is primarily attributed to the combined effects of ingestion and dermal absorption. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the prominent role of combustion-derived and pyrogenic sources of PAH in the examined aquatic ecosystems. This study unequivocally establishes that PAH-contaminated water sources significantly amplify the risk of cancer among both children and adults. The extent of risk variation is influenced by the specific water source, duration of exposure, and age group. Consequently, proactive identification of contaminated water sources and their pollution origins, coupled with targeted educational campaigns, holds promise for reducing the global burden of PAH-related cancer.

AB  - Background
Approximately 5% of patients with asthma have severe disease. Treatment escalation may occur despite symptoms not being due to asthma, leading to comorbidities occurring.
Objective
To explore factors associated with treatment escalation to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA): step 4/5 in patients with asthma. Methods: A nested case-control study of patients with asthma from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Study 1: patients who transitioned from GINA: steps 2/3 to steps 4/5 were compared with matched controls (GINA: step 2/3). Study 2: patients who transitioned from step 4 to step 5 were compared with matched controls (step 4).
Results
Study 1: Step 4/5 cases (n = 12,780) were older, obese, predominantly female, more comorbid (≥2) with increased exacerbations versus step 2/3 controls (n = 31,974) (P < .001). Exacerbations increased nearing treatment escalation in cases but not controls. Study 2: There was no difference in age, sex, or obesity levels in step 5 cases (n = 12,780) versus step 4 controls (n = 31,974). Cases were more comorbid (≥2) (54.0% vs 44.3%, P = .001), with increased mood disorder levels (depression/anxiety) (21.0% vs 13.7%, P = .002) and more exacerbations (81.4% vs 34.3%, P < .001), versus controls. Exacerbations and mood disorder were associated with treatment escalation (P < .001). Mood disorder and exacerbations were more common in cases than in controls, before study entry, but increased in cases alone nearing treatment escalation.
Conclusions
Treatment escalation is associated with mood disorder and asthma exacerbations. Obesity is highly prevalent in patients with asthma before treatment escalation. A symptom-based treatment approach potentially exposes patients to inappropriate treatment escalation.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Relapsed/Refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with central nervous system involvement (CNS B-ALL) have poor outcomes and were frequently excluded from CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) clinical trials. The efficacy and safety of brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) in adults with r/r B-ALL was established by the ZUMA-3 trial, which excluded patients with advanced or symptomatic CNS involvement. In this retrospective multicenter analysis, we investigated the safety and efficacy of brexu-cel in CNS B-ALL patients utilizing data from the Real-World Outcomes Collaborative for CAR T in ALL (ROCCA) consortium. Of 189 patients infused, 31 had CNS-2 (presence of blasts in CSF with < 5 WBC/uL) or CNS-3 (presence of blasts with >5 WBC/uL and/or clinical signs/symptoms) disease pre-apheresis and are the focus of this report. The median age was 46.5 years (range, 24-76), and 58.1% were males. Most (87.1%) received bridging therapy. Following brexu-cel, 21 of 24 with CNS restaging (87.5%) achieved CNS-1. Additionally, 28 of 30 evaluable patients achieved marrow complete remission (CR); 25 were MRD-negative. No statistically significant differences were seen in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) following brexu-cel among patients with or without CNS involvement. Similarly, grade 3-4 immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occurred similarly in patients with (35.5%) and without CNS disease (30%). In conclusion, our data suggest that brexu-cel results in high response rates in CNS B-ALL patients with toxicity comparable to patients without CNS involvement.

AB  - We systematically review theoretical and empirical research published in 38 journals over the last 52 years dealing with host-country nationals (HCNs) in multinational enterprises. We find that HCNs are treated in a relatively homogeneous manner, despite their important differences. Three themes dominate: HCN–expatriate relationships, human resources policies and practices influencing HCNs, and the impact of expatriate interactions on different HCNs. Social psychology theories are commonly applied, and most studies are empirical and cross-sectional. We suggest a more refined treatment of HCNs, promising theoretical and methodological approaches, and thematic directions to enrich the HCN literature further.

AB  - Coupled-cluster Green's function (GFCC) calculation has drawn much attention in the recent years for targeting the molecular and material electronic structure problems from a many-body perspective in a systematically improvable way. However, GFCC calculations on scientific computing clusters usually suffer from expensive higher dimensional tensor contractions in the complex space, expensive inter-process communication, and severe load imbalance, which limits it's use for tackling electronic structure problems. Here we present a numerical library prototype that is specifically designed for large-scale GFCC calculations. The design of the library is focused on a systematically optimal computing strategy to improve its scalability and efficiency. The performance of the library is demonstrated by the relevant profiling analysis of running GFCC calculations on remote giant computing clusters. The capability of the library is highlighted by computing a wide near valence band of a fullerene C60 molecule for the first time at the GFCCSD level that shows excellent agreement with the experimental spectrum.

AB  - Introduction The discovery of adenocarcinoma spectrum (AC) nodules often leads to a pathway of ongoing radiological observation, tissue biopsy, ablative therapies, or surgical excision. This complex decision-making process may be aided by machine learning. Score Indicative of Lung Cancer Aggression (SILA) was developed and validated as an evolution of previously developed radiomics models to predict the degree of histologic tumor invasion in AC and to predict patient survival. We now investigate if radiomics classification can help predict long term outcomes post stage I AC resection. Secondarily we explore if the geographic location of stage 1 AC nodules correlates with local invasion or long-term outcomes. Methods 196 patients with early-stage AC who underwent curative surgical resection were studied over a follow-up median period of 12 years. Kaplan Meyer analysis of disease-free survival was performed on patients whose index nodule was categorized by radiomics. Local invasion of tumor was analyzed using radiomics and histopathological assessment. The correlation of these metrics relating to the nodule's geographic location was explored. Finally, disease free survival analysis based on the location of the index nodule was performed. Results Patient’s whose stage I AC nodules were classified as “poor” prior to resection by our radiomics tool had worse long-term prognosis (> 5 year) compared to those classified as “intermediate” or “good”. AC Nodules in lower lung regions were proportionately more invasive than nodules in the upper lung regions, both based on radiomics and histopathological review. However, that did not translate to a disease-free survival advantage for upper lobe nodules that were resected. Conclusion Radiomics helps prognosticate long term outcomes in patients with resected stage I AC. Furthermore, histopathological invasion detected by radiomics seems to vary depending on geographical location of the nodule in the lung.

AB  - The international trade involving genetically modified organisms (GMOs) continue to spark controversies due to the complexities that go beyond the realms of trade and/or the environment. Currently, the international trade in GMOs and products thereof are regulated according to the rules agreed by World Trade Organization's (WTO) Members at the end of the Uruguay Round, particularly those spelt out in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. This chapter analyses the existing architecture of global governance in the control of transboundary movement, transit, handling, and use of all living modified organisms (LMOs) by reviewing these WTO's agreements as well as key decisions by the WTO's Appellate Body to understand their impact on trade in GMOs. Other disciplines arising from specific multilateral agreements that were negotiated outside the parameters of purely trade, in particular Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), also have a bearing on the transboundary movement of GMOs. A discussion is therefore included on the conflicting provisions arising at the intersection of Convention on Biological Diversity's Biosafety Protocol with the WTO Agreement that may have implications on the conservation of agrobiodiversity. Suggestions are included on the modes and mechanisms that can be used by the global community to resolve these conflicts.

AB  - Background
Exposure to high tidal volumes in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality and worse outcomes; however, adherence to lung protective ventilation is suboptimal. There is no generalizable tool or approach that has been demonstrated to optimize implementation of this parameter of mechanical ventilation.
Research Question
We tested whether development and deployment of a real-time ventilator management dashboard with twice-daily alerts communicating synthesized ventilator information to clinicians would improve adherence to lung protective ventilation (<=8cc/kg ideal body weight).
Methods
The Respiratory Insights Dashboard was developed to display key real-time patient and ventilator data for all intensive care patients in a large academic medical center, as well as send twice daily e-mail alerts to ICU staff identifying patients with out-of-range parameters. The five ICUs with lowest tidal volume adherence were pre-selected for analysis in a quasi-experimental study comparing pre-dashboard and post-dashboard periods.
Measurements and Main Results
1,376 patients received ventilation in the pre-intervention period, and 3,064 in the post-intervention period. Hourly adherence to lung protective ventilation rose from 78% to 87% (p <0.001). In patients initiated on ventilation with tidal volume >8cc/kg, the time to reaching adherence fell from a median of 9hr (IQR 2,26) to 5hr (IQR 1,15) (p=0.048). Interrupted time-series regression showed temporal trends both before and after intervention were not significantly different from zero; however, adherence level change after intervention was 8.3 (p=0.004). Increased adherence to LPV was also observed in multivariable regression (OR 1.438, P<0.001) along with an increase in adherence trend over time after implementation (OR 1.001, p=0.004).
Interpretation
A real-time ventilator management dashboard with tidal volume alerts significantly improved adherence to LPV hospital-wide as well as more-rapid correction of sub-optimal ventilator settings. Implementation was associated with an increase in LPV adherence that has persisted for 15 months of follow-up.

AB  - Employing renewable energy resources, such as new harvesting technologies, plays a significant role in reducing fossil fuel defects. One of these technologies is the piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH), which converts the energy generated by mechanical vibrations into electrical energy. This paper remarks on the perspective use of piezoelectric tiles, which is a great stride in commercialization. It can also raise researcher’s awareness and investors’ willingness to use this technology. Besides, this research recommends conducting a sensitivity analysis of the energy produced by these tiles and investigating its various consequences (e.g., emissions and traded energy to the grid), which is considered an innovative approach. This study presents a model to supply the lighting load of a university faculty building using piezoelectric tiles. This research also developed a balance between energy production and consumption modeling, optimization, and sensitivity analyses on energy production by piezoelectric tiles. Our findings revealed that the piezoelectric tiles are able to supply 50% of the lighting load, and it can increase by 80% by doubling the energy production. After doubling the efficiency (providing 80% of the lighting load), the energy that is purchased from the grid decreases by 51.81%, and the energy that is sold to the grid increases by 134.85%. In addition, emissions of pollutants, such as CO2, CO, and NOx, are diminished by 51.77, 51.75, and 51.96%, respectively. The results demonstrate that improvement of efficiency of energy production (α) by 89.73% leads to the purchased and sold energy that equals 345.65 kWh.

AB  - Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a neglected tropical disease endemic to over 30 countries, with increasing incidence in temperate, coastal Victoria, Australia. Strategies to control transmission are urgently required. This study systematically reviews the literature to identify and describe candidate prophylactic Buruli ulcer vaccines. This review highlights that Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the only vaccine studied in randomised controlled trials and confirms its importance as a benchmark for comparison against putative vaccines in pre-clinical studies. Nevertheless, BCG alone is unable to offer long-term protection in humans. A number of experimental vaccines that exceed the protection provided by BCG in mice have emerged, particularly those utilising recombinant BCG expressing immunogenic M. ulcerans proteins. Although progress is promising, there remain key questions about the optimal approach to characterising the immunological correlates of protection in humans and strategies to investigate the safety and efficacy of such vaccines in humans.

AB  - Context:
Double-counting in a literature review occurs when the same data, population, or evidence is erroneously counted multiple times during synthesis. Detecting and mitigating the threat of double-counting is particularly challenging in tertiary studies. Although this topic has received much attention in the health sciences, it seems to have been overlooked in software engineering.
Objective:
We describe issues with double-counting in tertiary studies, investigate the prevalence of the issue in software engineering, and propose ways to identify and address the issue.
Method:
We analyze 47 tertiary studies in software engineering to investigate in which ways they address double-counting and whether double-counting might be a threat to validity in them.
Results:
In 19 of the 47 tertiary studies, double-counting might bias their results. Of those 19 tertiary studies, only 5 consider double-counting a threat to their validity, and 7 suggest strategies to address the issue. Overall, only 9 of the 47 tertiary studies, acknowledge double-counting as a potential general threat to validity for tertiary studies.
Conclusions:
Double-counting is an overlooked issue in tertiary studies in software engineering, and existing design and evaluation guidelines do not address it sufficiently. Therefore, we propose recommendations that may help to identify and mitigate double-counting in tertiary studies.

AB  - Context
Over the past 20 years, software startups have created many products that have changed human life. Since these companies are creating brand-new products or services, requirements are difficult to gather and highly volatile. Although scientific interest in software development in this context has increased, the studies on requirements engineering in software startups are still scarce and mostly focused on elicitation activities.
Objective
This study overcomes this gap by answering how requirements engineering practices are performed in this context.
Method
We conducted a grounded theory study based on 17 interviews with software startups practitioners.
Results
We constructed a model to show that software startups do not follow a single set of practices but, instead, build a custom process, changed throughout the development of the company, combining different practices according to a set of influences (Founders, Software Development Manager, Developers, Market, Business Model and Startup Ecosystem).
Conclusion
Our findings show that requirements engineering activities in software startups are similar to those in agile teams, but some steps vary as a consequence of the lack of an accessible customer.

KW  - Test coverage criteria
AB  - Context
In software product line testing (SPLT), test coverage criterion is an important concept, as it provides a means of measuring the extent to which domain testing has been performed and redundant application testing can be avoided based on the test coverage level achieved in domain testing. However, no previous literature reviews on SPLT have addressed test coverage criterion in SPLT.
Objective
The objectives of this paper are as follows: (1) to clarify the notions of test basis and test coverage criterion for SPLT; (2) to identify the test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT; (3) to investigate how various SPLT aspects, such as the SPLT method, variability implementation mechanism, and variability management approach, affect the choice of test coverage criterion for SPLT; and (4) to analyze the limitations of test coverage criteria currently used for SPLT.
Method
This paper conducts a systematic review of test coverage criteria in SPLT with 78 selected studies.
Results
We have several findings that can guide the future research on SPLT. One important finding is that choice of test coverage criterion in SPLT is independent from variability implementation mechanism, variability management, SPL approach, and binding time but is dependent on the variability representation used in development artifacts. Another that is easily overlooked is that SPL test coverage criteria with the same test coverage criterion names of single system testing neither adequately convey what should be covered by the test methods applying them, nor can they be more generally regarded as extensions or generalizations for SPLT of their corresponding test coverage criteria of single system testing.
Conclusion
This study showed that SPL test coverage criteria should be defined or redefined so that they can clearly deliver the target properties to be satisfied by SPLT.

AB  - Background
We sought to determine the impact of the presence of a pharmacist on medication and patient related outcomes during the emergency management of critically ill patients requiring resuscitation or medical emergency response team care in a hospital setting.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search of databases from January 1995 to April 2023 was conducted to identify studies of contemporary pharmacist practice. Results were extracted and analysed for included studies, those evaluating the impact of the presence of a pharmacist on medication and patient related outcomes during the emergency management of critically ill hospitalised patients requiring resuscitation or medical emergency response team care. To determine risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment scale was used for non-randomised studies and the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials.
Results
Of 1345 studies identified, 54 were selected for full text review, and 30 were included in the final analysis. There were 29 cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial. The studies reported the impact of a pharmacist for a variety of patient presentations. The study team assigned each study to one of eight patient cohorts: acute stroke, cardiac arrest, rapid response calls, S-T segment elevation myocardial infarction, acute haemorrhage, major trauma resuscitation, sepsis and status epilepticus. The most frequently reported outcome, associated with a statistically significant benefit in 23 studies, was time to medication administration. Few studies reported a significant difference in patient outcome measures such as mortality. Only 8 of the 30 studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias.
Conclusions
The results of this systematic review provide support for a beneficial impact of a pharmacist presence and intervention during resuscitation or medical emergency response team care, with significant improvements in outcomes such as time to initiation of time-critical medications, medication appropriateness and guideline compliance. However, studies were predominantly small and retrospective and were not powered to detect differences in patient related measures such as length of stay and mortality. Future research should investigate the clinical impacts of the pharmacist in ED resuscitation settings in controlled, prospective studies with robust sampling methods.

AB  - Introduction
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is one of the treatment options for the management of residual or recurrent secreting pituitary adenomas (PA). While the role of radiosurgery (RS) by Gamma Knife (GK) has been clearly established, Cyberknife (CK) RS has been evaluated in fewer series.
Material and methods
To perform a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis, with the aim of focusing on the effect of CK RS on secreting PA. Using PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed articles published between January 1994 and January 2024. The inclusion criteria contained: single fraction RS, biochemical remission, tumor control and complication appearance (hypopituitarism).
Results
Were incorporated 8 studies including 152 secreting PA. Vast majority were treated in single fraction 115 (75.6 %), with an overall rate of 59.9 % (p < 0.001). Total remission was encountered in 44/108 patients, for an overall rate of 50.2 % (p < 0.001). Partial remission was inconsistently reported among studies for 25/55 patients, for an overall rate of 38.8 % (p = 0.003). Uncontrolled disease was encountered in 36/108 patients, for an overall rate of 32.7 % (p < 0.001). Tumor control was not separately reported for secreting or non-secreting PA, but attained overall high rates.
Conclusion
Single fraction CK radiosurgery is common practice for secreting PA. Our meta-analysis suggests high rates of both total and partial remission (as high as 89 % if both taken together), with a complete remission rate of 50.2 %. These results encourage the use of single fraction CK RS for secreting PA. To reach high rates of biochemical control, high doses of irradiation should be used.

AB  - Monitoring techniques can improve the life cycle of railway infrastructure, increasing reliability, safety, and reducing costs. The use of on-board and wayside sensors in the railway industry for condition-based maintenance is helping to reduce maintenance costs. Since the 1990 s, research into railway track condition monitoring has intensified, with recent advances in inertial sensors. This review examines and classifies the use of on-board sensors, focusing on data acquisition using vehicle-mounted accelerometers. Despite advances in other methods, such as automated visual inspection or eddy current-based systems, critical elements like rail fasteners still require manual inspection. Environmental conditions and the complexity of real-time analysis make it difficult to detect problems early using other methods. The study underlines the need for research into vibration analysis, optimal placement of accelerometers and signal processing techniques to effectively detect track problems, such as loosening of fastenings, at an early stage.

AB  - Delivering high-quality software products is a challenging task. It needs proper coordination from various teams in planning, execution, and testing. Many software products have high numbers of defects revealed in a production environment. Software failures are costly regarding money, time, and reputation for a business and even life-threatening if utilized in critical applications. Identifying and fixing software defects in the production system is costly, which could be a trivial task if detected before shipping the product. Binary classification is commonly used in existing software defect prediction studies. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence techniques, there is a great potential to provide meaningful information to software development teams for producing quality software products. An extensive survey for Software Defect Prediction is necessary for exploring datasets, data validation methods, defect detection, and prediction approaches and tools. The survey infers standard datasets utilized in early studies lack adequate features and data validation techniques. According to the finding of the literature survey, the standard datasets has few labels, resulting in insufficient details regarding defects. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) on Software Defect Prediction are limited. Hence this SLR presents a comprehensive analysis of defect datasets, dataset validation, detection, prediction approaches, and tools for Software Defect Prediction. The survey exhibits the futuristic recommendations that will allow researchers to develop a tool for Software Defect Prediction. The survey introduces the architecture for developing a software prediction dataset with adequate features and statistical data validation techniques for multi-label classification for software defects.

AB  - Polymer nanocomposites are known as materials comprising of a polymer matrix and an inorganic dispersive phase that possess a nanometric-scale dimension. The integration of nanomaterials/nanofiber into polymeric matrix offers substantial improvements, such as higher mechanical and thermal properties, that enhance the performance of polymer nanocomposites. In these composites, interface/interphase of constituents plays a vital role in introducing additional features on the subsequent nanocomposites. The key stimulating characteristic of polymer nanocomposites is the multifaceted interfacial regions that exist amid the nanomaterials/nanofiber and polymer matrices. The adhesion level between nanomaterials/nanofiber and matrixes has a huge impact on the ultimate mechanical properties of a composite. This chapter brings new insights to the researchers of the field by shedding light in understanding the interface/interphase in polymer nanocomposites.

AB  - Background
BAT2206 is being developed as a ustekinumab (UST) biosimilar.
Objectives
Equivalent efficacy and comparable safety results of BAT2206 and UST in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis up to Week 28 (treatment period [TP] 1) have been reported previously. TP2 (post Week 28 to 52) results are presented here.
Methods
Patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response (≥PASI-75) at Week 28 entered TP2. Qualified patients of the UST group in TP1 were re-randomized 1:1 into UST-BAT2206 or UST-UST groups, while qualified patients of the BAT2206 group continued with BAT2206 (BAT2206-BAT2206 group). In TP2, secondary efficacy endpoints, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity were assessed at Week 32, 40, 44, and 52.
Results
528 patients entered TP2, of which 133, 131, and 264 were assigned to UST-UST, UST-BAT2206, and BAT2206-BAT2206 groups, respectively. The secondary efficacy endpoints and the adverse events showed no obvious differences across all three groups. There were no notable differences in the UST serum concentrations. Immunogenicity was comparable, and the switching from UST to BAT2206 did not lead to an increased immunogenicity.
Limitations
No data collected after Week 52.
Conclusion
Outcomes were comparable among the groups in TP2, with no impact from the UST-to-BAT2206 switch.

AB  - Purpose
Most index cases with novel coronavirus infections transmit disease to just one or two other individuals, but some individuals “super-spread”—they infect many secondary cases. Understanding common factors that super-spreaders may share could inform outbreak models, and be used to guide contact tracing during outbreaks.
Methods
We searched in MEDLINE, Scopus, and preprints to identify studies about people documented as transmitting pathogens that cause SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 to at least nine other people. We extracted data to describe them by age, sex, location, occupation, activities, symptom severity, any underlying conditions, disease outcome and undertook quality assessment for outbreaks published by June 2021.
Results
The most typical super-spreader was a male age 40+. Most SARS or MERS super-spreaders were very symptomatic, the super-spreading occurred in hospital settings and frequently the individual died. In contrast, COVID-19 super-spreaders often had very mild disease and most COVID-19 super-spreading happened in community settings.
Conclusions
SARS and MERS super-spreaders were often symptomatic, middle- or older-age adults who had a high mortality rate. In contrast, COVID-19 super-spreaders tended to have mild disease and were any adult age. More outbreak reports should be published with anonymized but useful demographic information to improve understanding of super-spreading, super-spreaders, and the settings in which super-spreading happens.

AB  - Farming is a stressful occupation with variable risks, including weather variability, volatile export markets and increasing isolation. The underutilisation of services and supports for mental health in rural populations is of concern given the high rates of suicide among farmers. This study aimed to examine the use of mental health services by famers in Western Australia, including service preferences, attitudes, awareness and accessibility. An exploratory mixed-methods design was adopted, comprising data from interviews (N = 28) and a survey (N = 124). Community-led initiatives were perceived as essential to mental health support in farming communities. The need for community supports was emphasised as an important solution to address in part, the barriers farmers experienced to professional services, including limited awareness and physical access to services; remote location, financial and time constraints; and concerns regarding confidentiality. These findings highlight the importance of working with farming communities to enable service access and to further improve engagement with mental health services.

AB  - Code Smell Detection (CSD) plays a crucial role in improving software quality and maintainability. And Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as a promising approach for CSD due to their superior performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based CSD methods heavily relies on the quality of the training data. Despite its importance, little attention has been paid to analyzing the data preparation process. This systematic literature review analyzes the data preparation techniques used in DL-based CSD methods. We identify 36 relevant papers published by December 2023 and provide a thorough analysis of the critical considerations in constructing CSD datasets, including data requirements, collection, labeling, and cleaning. We also summarize seven primary challenges and corresponding solutions in the literature. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for preparing and accessing high-quality CSD data, emphasizing the importance of data diversity, standardization, and accessibility. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to harness the full potential of DL techniques in CSD.

AB  - Introduction
Research in healthcare leadership has focused on leaders. In contrast, organizational success may be more influenced by followers. Kelley described five followership styles based on two characteristics: active engagement and independent critical thinking. We examined the literature on the association between followership style and workplace outcomes.
Methods
Articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched. Given the paucity of studies, we expanded our search to non-healthcare databases. Two reviewers identified all studies examining followership styles and their association with job satisfaction and/or performance outcomes. Included studies were evaluated using the GRADE approach.
Results
We identified one article on followership for every sixty articles on leadership in the medical literature. Fourteen observational studies on followership were included in our analysis. Outcomes ranged from the individual to the organizational level. No synthesized analysis was possible due to heterogeneity. Followership styles with greater active engagement and independent critical thinking were associated with increased job satisfaction, decreased burnout, and workplace performance metrics.
Conclusions
There is a dearth of studies on followership. The literature suggests that followership characterized by greater independence is associated with positive outcomes. Given the importance of teamwork in the critical care environment, we should prioritize understanding of this important variable.

AB  - The role of additive manufacturing (AM) for healthcare applications is growing, particularly in the aspiration to meet subject-specific requirements. This article reviews the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance pre-, during-, and post-AM processes to meet a wider range of subject-specific requirements of healthcare interventions. This article introduces common AM processes and AI tools, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. The role of AI in pre-processing is described in the core dimensions like structural design and image reconstruction, material design and formulations, and processing parameters. The role of AI in a printing process is described based on hardware specifications, printing configurations, and core operational parameters such as temperature. Likewise, the post-processing describes the role of AI for surface finishing, dimensional accuracy, curing processes, and a relationship between AM processes and bioactivity. The later sections provide detailed scientometric studies, thematic evaluation of the subject topic, and also reflect on AI ethics in AM for biomedical applications. This review article perceives AI as a robust and powerful tool for AM of biomedical products. From tissue engineering (TE) to prosthesis, lab-on-chip to organs-on-a-chip, and additive biofabrication for range of products; AI holds a high potential to screen desired process-property-performance relationships for resource-efficient pre- to post-AM cycle to develop high-quality healthcare products with enhanced subject-specific compliance specification.

AB  - Background:
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common inflammatory rheumatism characterized by an increased cardiovascular risk. Regarding the last EULAR recommendations, physical activity is an important part of the management of RA. The evaluation of Physical activity level is needed to know RA patients practices. However, to our knowledge, there is no consensual measure tool of the physical activity level for patients suffering RA.
Objectives:
The aim of this study is to evaluate the different methods of measurement of physical activity levels in RA.
Methods:
This is a systematic review of literature realized on the pubmed and Cochrane databases and meeting the PRISMA recommendations. We used the following key words: « physical activity », « physical activity level » AND « rheumatoid arthritis ». We included only article written in English language and with RA patients older than 18 years old.
Results:
We identified 190 studies with the key words, 51 were selected on title and 23 articles have been identified as eligible. Finally, 19 studies were included in this review. In total, of the 19 selected studies, 13567 RA patients were evaluated on their level of physical activity. There were 73,4% female with a mean age of 56,1 years. In 10 studies, the BMI was available with results between 25 and 30 kg/m2. Two methods for measuring physical activity levels have been identified. Questionnaires, a subjective tool, were used in 13 studies. It should be noted that 8 different questionnaires were used in these studies with recurrent use of the IPAQ (international validated questionnaire in general population) and SQUASH (validated in English language in RA). In these studies, patients were predominantly sedentary with a proportion of patients meeting WHO physical activity recommendations ranging from 20 to 77%. It appears that Scandinavian patients are clearly the most active. Concerning objective measurement tools, 9 studies evaluated the level of physical activity using activity tracker. 7 studies used the accelerometer, 1 used the VO2 max, 1 used an actimeter. All studies showed a sedentary behavior. In these studies, the results were expressed as energy expenditure and not as a percentage of patients meeting WHO recommendations. Thus, the comparison between the two methods is difficult, but accelerometer showed a significant decrease in the level of physical activity in RA. The oldest studies (2002 and 2007) showed that only 30% of patient met the WHO recommendations, but the recent studies (2017 and 2018) showed the same prevalence of sedentary behavior. The disease activity and the disease duration were comparable between the different studies.
Conclusion:
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis present a sedentary behavior. Objective and subjective tools showed the low level of physical activity over the past decade. These data illustrate the necessity of the promotion of physical activity in rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Modern service systems are constantly improving with the development of various IT technologies, leading to a boost in system scales and complex dependencies among service components. The large scale and complexity of services make them more prone to failure. To maintain services’ normal and stable operation, alert and incident management (AIM), which analyzes and handles service failures in time, has become an important content of IT service management (ITSM). Many intelligent solutions have been proposed to improve the management process. However, there is currently no comprehensive survey that systematically reviews related works. Moreover, no integrated AIM architecture can cover each detailed process or most existing piecemeal solutions. Therefore, we conduct an in-depth survey to address these problems. To the best of our knowledge, the paper is the most comprehensive survey on intelligent AIM in IT services. Through this survey, we make the following contributions. First, we summarize an integrated architecture that includes detailed AIM processes and key techniques. Second, we provide a systematic review of related works based on the architecture. Third, we give a valuable analysis of current challenges and trends in AIM.

Objective: The aim with this paper is to provide an extensive review of existing mobile app development models. Method: The review is done by following a systematic literature review process. Also presented is an assessment of the usefulness and relevance to industry of the models based on a rigor and relevance framework. Results: 20 primary studies were identified, each with distinct models. Agile methods or state-based principles are commonly adopted across the models. Relatively little effort focuses on deployment, maintenance, project evaluation activities. Conclusion: The review reveals that the contexts in which the identified models are intended to be used vary. This benefits practitioners as they are able to select a model that suits their contexts. However, the usefulness in industry of most of the models, based on the contexts in which the models were evaluated, is questionable. There is a need for evaluating mobile app models in contexts that resemble realistic contexts. The review also calls for further research addressing special constraints of mobile apps, e.g., testing apps on multiple-platforms, user involvement in release planning and continuous deployment.

AB  - Background
Adverse childhood experiences are prevalent robust risk factors for the development of substance use problems. However, less is known about the causal mechanisms that explain these relationships. While directly preventing adverse childhood experiences is ideal, it is not always possible. In such cases, the mechanisms themselves may be amenable to intervention, allowing for the effective prevention of problematic substance use among children exposed to adversity. Identifying such mechanisms is therefore a critical step for efforts aiming to reduce the high individual and societal burdens associated with substance use globally.
Objective
This study aims to systematically identify and synthesize evidence on the modifiable mediators and moderators of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes in young people (age 10-24 years).
Methods
A systematic review will be conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases to determine the modifiable mediators and moderators of the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and substance use in young people. Data from the review will be qualitatively synthesized, unless we identify a sufficient number of studies (at least five) that examine the same type of adversity (eg, physical or sexual abuse) and the same mediator/moderator, in which case a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) will be conducted. If a quantitative synthesis is warranted, standardized effect estimates of the indirect (mediated) effect between adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes will be combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. Mediators/moderators will be grouped according to a socioecological perspective, using the four levels of individual, interpersonal, community, and public policy/culture.
Results
Electronic searches were completed in August 2019. A total of 4004 studies were included for screening after removing duplicates. After evaluating titles and abstracts against eligibility criteria, a further 3590 studies were excluded, leaving 415 studies for full-text screening. The results of the review are expected to be available by December 2020.
Conclusions
The mechanisms linking adverse childhood experiences and substance use outcomes in young people are vital targets for substance use prevention efforts. This review will provide evidence to inform the development of prevention strategies in order to interrupt the negative life trajectory that can begin with childhood adversity.

AB  - The industrial sector is a significant energy consumer amidst the ongoing energy transition to renewable energy resources. With the rising penetration of volatile renewable sources, the need for managed electricity consumption, i.e., demand-side management intensifies. However, the participation of incentivized programs is mostly limited to single consumers with a vast electricity consumption. Recent regulatory changes have allowed independent aggregators to participate in the reserve and ancillary market, enabling smaller end-users to contribute. With the numerous demand-side management contribution possibilities, including energy efficiency and demand-response measures, the objective of the study is to systematically categorize demand-side management applications across different industrial sectors and stages. Furthermore, the study aims to analyze interconnections between these objectives, which are predominantly addressed in isolation within the existing research literature. Highlighting the potential in industrial electricity consumption optimization contributes to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals 7, 9, and 13. To structure the application possibilities within the less-energy intensive industry, a systematic mapping study was conducted covering developments from 2012. An initial search was conducted on several literature databases, and structured selection and data extraction were applied. Cited and referenced studies were screened until no more relevant publications were found. Studies show a wide range of application possibilities and were structured and compiled into an application map. Trends show the increasing inclusion of storage devices in recent publications. Application of energy-flexible and energy-efficient objectives shows synergetic effects. A notable lack of studies focusing on ancillary markets within the less energy-intensive industries was discovered.

AB  - Deep learning models are widely being employed for object detection due to their high performance. However, the majority of applications that require object detection are functioning on resource-constrained edge devices. In the present era, there is a need for deep learning-based object detectors that are lightweight and perform well on these constrained edge devices. Objective: The research aims to identify current trends in resource-constrained applications for deep learning-based object detectors in terms of the technique used to create the model, the type of input image involved, the type of device used, and the type of application addressed by the model. Method: To achieve the objective of our research, a systematic literature review was carried out that yielded 167 studies. The models or techniques employed in the studies were grouped to better understand the research problem at hand. This review carefully reports every decision and provides many visualizations of the final studies in order to draw clear conclusions. Conclusion: The conclusion discussed the gaps, possibilities, and future perspectives discovered throughout the research process, implying that this field of study has grown profoundly in the last decade.

AB  - The continuous growth of the world population and its agglomeration in urban cities, demand an increasing need for mobility, which in turn contributes to the worsening of traffic congestion and pollution in cities. Therefore, it is necessary to promote active travel, such as walking and cycling. However, this is not an easy task, as pedestrians and cyclists are the most vulnerable link in the system, and low levels of safety, security and comfort can contribute to choosing private cars over active travel. Hence, it is essential to understand the determinants that affect the perceptions of pedestrians and cyclists, in order to support the definition of policies that promote the use of active modes of transport. Thus, this article fills an important gap in the literature by identifying and discussing the objective and subjective determinants that affect the perceptions of safety, security and comfort of pedestrians and cyclists, through a systematic review of the literature published in the last ten years. It followed the PRISMA statement guidelines and checklist, resulting in 68 relevant articles that were carefully analyzed. The results show that the perception of safety is negatively affected by fear of traffic-related injuries, fear of falling related to infrastructure and infrastructure maintenance, and negative behavior of drivers. Regarding security, crime was the major concern of pedestrians and cyclists, either with emphasis on the person or on personal property. With regard to comfort, high levels of air and noise pollution, lack of vegetation, bad weather conditions, slopes and long commuting distances negatively affected the users' perception. The results also suggest that poor lighting affects all domains, providing a negative perception of safety, security and comfort. Similarly, the presence of people is seen as negatively influencing the perception of safety and comfort, while the absence of people negatively impacts the perception of security. Therefore, the findings achieved by this study are key to assist in the definition of transport policies and infrastructure creation in large smart cities. Additionally, new transport policies are proposed and discussed.

AB  - Background & Aims
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a severe, life-threatening condition for some patients. This systematic review aimed to identify and rank early prognostic factors associated with reduced survival in AIH.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in Ovid Medline and embase.com up to April 2024 for identifying early prognostic factors for the combined endpoints of death or liver transplantation and liver-related death or liver transplantation. Overview tables of prognostic factors were constructed to outline the number of studies, the respective effect direction and statistical significance. Meta-analysis was performed if at least three studies reported on a factor. The level of certainty in evidence was evaluated using the GRADE guideline.
Results
Thirty-three studies were included, and 44 prognostic factors were investigated in at least two studies. Cirrhosis at diagnosis (HR 3.21, 95% CI 2.38-4.34) and insufficient response to therapy (HR 4.35, 95% CI 2.5-7.58) were significant predictors with the highest risk ratios. Additional factors associated with reduced survival include advanced age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, variant syndrome with PSC, asymptomatic presentation, higher relapse rates and elevated INR, creatinine, ALP/AST ratio, and MELD score. Protective factors include elevated baseline levels of aminotransferases and albumin levels.
Conclusion
Cirrhosis and insufficient treatment response are the prognostic factors with the highest impact on reduced survival in AIH. Other risk factors include advanced age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, PSC-variant syndrome, asymptomatic presentation, higher relapse rates and elevated INR, creatinine, ALP/AST ratio, and MELD score, while elevated baseline aminotransferases and albumin are protective.

AB  - Abstract:
Despite the clinical success of redirected T cells in the setting of cancer adoptive cell immunotherapy, patients may exhibit resistance to treatment, resulting in uncontrolled disease and relapses. This phenomenon partly relies on impaired ex vivo-produced T cell metabolic fitness, including a decreased respiratory reserve as well as a greater sensitivity to tumour-mediated metabolic stress. To improve the respiratory capacity of cultured T cells, we sought to target the NAD/SIRT-1/ROS axis through supplementation of culture medium with resveratrol. Resveratrol-treated T cells display broader respiratory capacities, along with sustained ROS control ability. Strikingly, we reveal that the effect of resveratrol on T cells is restricted to cytomegalovirus-exposed donors, a virus known to promote immune ageing. Herein, cytomegalovirus prior infection is associated with the influence of terminally differentiated T cell on the fate of companion T cell subsets. Moreover, beyond resveratrol’s effect on redirected T cell metabolic features, it provides a functional anti-tumour advantage to these CMV seropositive donor-derived T cells, in a third generation CD123-specific CAR-T cell in vitro model. This highlights the necessity to consider patient’s intrinsic attributes, especially immune ageing-related ones, when assessing new T cell production process to improve clinical efficacy, pushing of personalized medicine limits.

AB  - The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) significantly impedes drug delivery to the central nervous system. Nanotechnology, especially surface-functionalized lipid nanoparticles, offers innovative approaches to overcome this barrier. However, choosing an effective functionalization strategy is challenging due to the lack of detailed comparative analysis in current literature. Our systematic review examined various functionalization strategies and their impact on BBB permeability from 2041 identified articles, of which 80 were included for data extraction. Peptides were the most common modification (18) followed by mixed strategies (12) proteins (9), antibodies (7), and other strategies (8). Interestingly, 26 studies showed BBB penetration with unmodified or modified nanoparticles using commonly applied strategies such as PEGylation or surfactant addition. Statistical analysis across 42 studies showed correlation between higher in vivo permeation improvements and nanoparticle type, size, and functionalization category. The highest ratios were found for nanostructured lipid carriers or biomimetic systems, in studies with particle sizes under 150 nm, and in those applying mixed functionalization strategies. The interstudy heterogeneity we observed highlights the importance of adopting standardized evaluation protocols to enhance comparability. Our systematic review aims to provide a comparative insight and identify future research directions in the development of more effective lipid nanoparticle systems for drug delivery to the brain to help improve the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders and brain tumours.

AB  - Significance of using drainage water (DW) is rising as freshwater resources are under growing pressure around the world, particularly in arid regions like Khuzestan province in Iran, which faces both water scarcity and excessive agricultural DW disposal predicaments. Drainage water recycling (DWR), capturing and storing DW for reuse as supplemental irrigation, is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to fulfill both production and environmental objectives. In this context, a theoretical study was conducted to predict the impact of DWR on sugarcane yield within Amirkabir Agro-industry. The study also aimed to suggest an optimal proportion of reusable DW, taking into account the highest overall economic and environmental benefits. For this purpose, an all-inclusive index named the comprehensive profitability of consumed water (CPCW) was introduced and employed to incorporate various critical attributes of DWR system, in terms of crop yield, cost opportunity, disposal cost, and environmental impacts. Demonstrating an optimal ratio of 23 % for recycled DW, the study showed a 19 % reduction in sugarcane yield resulting from a 45 % increase in irrigation water salinity, leading to the highest CPCW index. The calculated water savings can increase alternate opportunity costs to supplement irrigation for downstream date orchards (28780 ha) or wheat fields (86400 ha). The reduction in drainage disposal costs had a significant impact on improving the CPCW index. To comply more with the priorities of the farmers, a more reasonable reduction of 15 % in the crop yield was considered, which led to 20 % proportional recycled DW. This practice reused 323 Mm3 of drainage water. A sum of 666 Mm3 of water from Karun River was conserved through this practice. Overall, the proposed DWR practice has proven highly effective in substantially reducing the adverse environmental consequences of DW disposal to downstream natural water bodies.

AB  - The Web of Things (WoT) Architecture recommendation of W3C defines a framework for integrating Things (e.g. devices) into the Web. It establishes an information representation of Things based on JSON-LD and RESTful API interfaces to enable access to Things. Leveraging the latest results on hypermedia construction and documentation of RESTful APIs, we argue that OpenAPI can also be used to provide documentation of Things that adheres to the W3C Architecture recommendation. OpenAPI is a widely accepted industry standard endorsed by prominent industry vendors and user communities. Therefore, it is mature and can become acceptable. An essential part of the approach is a mechanism that facilitates the generation of OpenAPI Thing Descriptions and a Web proxy that implements access to Things on the Web. An implementation of the API is also proposed and evaluated. Last but not least, OpenAPI achieves uniformity of representation of both types of WoT entities (i.e. Web services and Things) that co-exist and interact with each other in an application. This has a positive impact on the way WoT applications are designed and implemented.

KW  - Systematic Mapping Study
AB  - Context:
Cognitive load in software engineering refers to the mental effort users spend while reading software artifacts. The cognitive load can vary according to tasks and across developers. Researchers have measured developers’ cognitive load for different purposes, such as understanding its impact on productivity and software quality. Thus, researchers and practitioners can use cognitive load measures for solving many aspects of software engineering problems.
Problem:
However, a lack of a classification of dimensions on cognitive load measures in software engineering makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to obtain research trends to advance scientific knowledge or apply it in software projects.
Objective:
This article aims to classify different aspects of cognitive load measures in software engineering and identify challenges for further research.
Method:
We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), which started with 4,175 articles gathered from 11 search engines and then narrowed down to 63 primary studies.
Results:
Our main findings are: (1) 43% (27/63) of the primary studies focused on applying a combination of sensors; (2) 81% (51/63) of the selected works were validation studies; (3) 83% (52/63) of the primary studies analyzed cognitive load while developers performed programming tasks. Moreover, we created a classification scheme based on the answers to our research questions.
Conclusion:
despite the production of a significant amount of studies on cognitive load in software engineering, there are still many challenges to be solved in this particular field for effectively measuring the cognitive load in software engineering. Therefore, this work provided directions for future studies on cognitive load measurement in software engineering.

AB  - Keratinocyte carcinoma, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, is the most prevalent form of cancer within the United States, with its incidence rapidly rising annually among patients over 65 years of age and those who are immunocompromised. Over the last decade there have been multiple advancements made in the development of non-invasive diagnostic methods for identification of keratinocyte carcinoma which have the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary skin biopsies. Part 1 of this CME will outline current and emerging non-invasive modalities for the diagnosis of keratinocyte carcinoma including dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography, electrical impedance spectroscopy, tape-stripping to isolate genetic material or proteins from the stratum corneum, and artificial intelligence. These methods are particularly helpful in patients with comorbidities or contraindications for skin biopsies, within cosmetically sensitive regions, and patients suffering from biopsy fatigue and/or fear.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Evidence about the environmental impacts of shared mobility is fragmented and scattered. In this article a systematic literature review is presented. The review focuses on assessments that use Life-Cycle Assessment to quantify the environmental impacts of car sharing, carpooling, bikesharing, and scooter/moped sharing. The results of these assessments were analyzed, as well as the factors that influence these impacts. Business-to-consumer car sharing, peer-to-peer car sharing, carpooling, bikesharing, and scooter/moped sharing can all cause gains and losses in terms of changing the environmental impacts of passenger transportation. The findings presented here refute unconditional claims that shared mobility delivers environmental benefits. Factors that influence changes in environmental impacts from passenger transportation from shared mobility include travel behaviour, the design of shared mobility modes, and how such schemes are implemented, as well as the local context. Local governments and shared mobility organisations can benefit from the analysis presented here by deepening their understanding of these factors and considering the life-cycle phase where the greatest impacts are caused.

AB  - Introduction
The first sign of dental caries is denoted by white spot lesions (WSLs) which can be defined as a demineralization of the enamel surface and subsurface, although these lesions can be reversed and do not form cavities. The aim of this systematic review was investigate which remineralization agents are effective for the treatment of WSLs.
Materials and Methods
For this systematic review a literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect.
Results
The initial search resulted in 273 references. After elimination of duplicate articles, 236 references remained. After reading titles and abstracts, all non-relevant results were excluded, resulting in 45 potentially relevant studies. After reading the full text, 13 references were included.
Conclusion
More studies are required for scientific evidence in order to reach a conclusion of the most suitable therapeutic method for the treatment of surface and subsurface demineralization of the enamel.

AB  - Software defect prediction is a constant challenge in industrial software engineering and represents a significant problem for quality and cost in software development worldwide. The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the quartiles, countries, keywords, techniques, metrics, tools, platforms or languages, variables, data sources, and datasets used in software defect prediction. A comprehensive search of 45 articles from 2019 to 2023, using 5 databases (Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost, and Web of Science), was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) methodology. Results show that 60.00 % of the studies were carried out in 2023, and 68.89 % of journals were in the Q1 and Q2 quartiles. The most common techniques were Support Vector Machine (42.22 %) and Random Forest (35.56 %). The most commonly used evaluation metrics were Accuracy and F1-Score (68.89 %). Python was the main programming language (35.56 %), with Kilo (thousands) of lines of code (31.11 %) and Cyclomatic complexity (26.67 %) as key variables. Finally, NASA's Metrics Data Program Data Repository was the most used data source (31.11 %) with a dataset ranging from a minimum of 759 instances and 37 attributes to a maximum of 3579 instances and 38 attributes from 5 projects: CM1, MW1, PC1, PC3, and PC4. This systematic review provides scientific evidence on how machine learning algorithms aid in predicting software defects and improving development processes. In addition, it offers a detailed discussion by identifying trends, limitations, successful approaches, and areas for improvement, providing valuable recommendations for future research.

AB  - Hashimoto's thyroiditis, characterized by thyroid-specific autoantibodies, is one of the commonest autoimmune disorders. Although the exact etiology has not been fully elucidated, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is related to an interaction among genetic elements, environmental factors and epigenetic influences. Cellular and humoral immunity play a key role in the development of the disease; thus, a T and B cells inflammatory infiltration is frequently found. Histopathologic features of the disease include lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, lymphoid follicle formation with germinal centers, and parenchymal atrophy. Moreover, the occurrence of large follicular cells and oxyphilic or Askanazy cells is frequently associated to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Clinically, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized mainly by systemic manifestations due to the damage of the thyroid gland, developing a primary hypothyroidism. Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is clinical and based on clinical characteristics, positivity to serum antibodies against thyroid antigens (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin), and lymphocytic infiltration on cytological examination. The mainstream of treatment is based on the management of the hypothyroidism with a substitution therapy. A relationship between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a possible malignant transformation has been proposed in several studies and involves immunological/hormonal pathogenic links although specific correlation is still debated and needs to be further investigated with prospective studies.

AB  - Summary
While rationing of healthcare resources is inevitable even in the most developed economies, particularly on the wake of a pandemic, ethical basis of its implementation needs to be reviewed. With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

AB  - Legal gender recognition (LGR) refers to laws, policies, and administrative procedures that enable transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people to update their legal identity documents (ID) to reflect their self-determined gender. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the health effects of LGR and a nested scoping review of TGD people's LGR-related values and preferences (PROSPERO CRD42023441769). We searched seven databases through April 19, 2024, and organization websites (for grey literature) through August 2023. The effectiveness review included quantitative studies evaluating the effect of LGR (policies or possession of gender-concordant ID) on seven domains of health and well-being. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses when possible and otherwise used narrative synthesis. Study risk of bias and confidence in the cumulative evidence were assessed using the ROBINS-E and GRADE, respectively. We screened 2748 studies and included 24 in the effectiveness review. In meta-analyses, LGR was associated with less suicidal ideation (OR = 0.75; 95 % CI: 0.56–1.00, I2 = 46 %) and psychological distress (e.g., OR for LGR on all versus no ID = 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.40, 0.70, I2 = 17 %). LGR may reduce anticipated discrimination, increase healthcare utilization, reduce gonadectomies, and improve socio-economic status, but the evidence was very uncertain. We included 31 studies on TGD persons' values and preferences. They perceived well-being benefits of LGR, had diverse personal preferences related to safety, and reported financial and policy barriers to LGR. In conclusion, LGR may improve TGD mental health and is perceived to reduce exposure to stigma and discrimination. Higher-quality effectiveness research is needed on other health and well-being outcomes, as well as research to evaluate specific LGR policy provisions.

In this study, an umbrella review and meta-analysis of meta-analyses was conducted to examine the prevalence of various mental health problems experienced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review searching PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases (PROSPERO: CRD42022304823). We performed a meta-analysis to summarize prevalence of different mental health problems and examined whether these differed as a function of job category, sex/gender, sociodemographic index (SDI), and across time. Eighty-seven meta-analyses were included in the umbrella review and meta-analysis, including 1846 non-overlapping articles and 9,400,962 participants. The overall prevalence ratio for the different mental health outcomes ranged from 0.20 for PTSD (95 % CI: 0.16–0.25) to 0.44 for burnout (95 % CI: 0.32–0.56), with ratios for depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, perceived stress, sleep problems, and insomnia symptoms falling between these ranges. Follow-up analyses revealed little variation in outcomes across job category, and sex. Prevalence of mental health problems in HCWs was high during the pandemic. Administrators and policymakers worldwide need to address these growing problems through institutional policies and wellness programming.

The strongest themes across IB journals are performance, perspective and emerging economies/MNEs, shared strongly across UK/Europe, US and Asia-based journals. Our findings report on the prevalent research field, economy and geography, the latter analyzing the impact of author numbers and distribution, and thus, scale effects. Within this context, sole authorships are largely replaced by co-authorships, yet often on national level. We further limited the study to IB policy and found the focus centers on key themes of foreign business attraction, transnational governance and IB promotion.

AB  - Background
Pain is challenging after recovery from total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures, and patients often receive prescription opioids. However, opioid consumption by patients remains unclear, and unused opioids may lead to risks including misuse and diversion. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare prescription size versus patient-reported consumption of opioids after discharge following TKA and THA.
Methods
PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for publications published between 2015 and 2022 on patient-reported consumption of opioids after TKA and THA. The primary outcome was opioid use in oxycodone 5-mg equivalents. Team members independently reviewed studies for screening, inclusion, data extraction, and risk of bias.
Results
Among the 17 included studies (15 TKA and 11 THA), discharge opioid prescribing exceeded consumption for both TKA (88.4 versus 65.0 pills at 6 weeks) and THA (64.0 versus 29.8 pills at 12 weeks). For both TKA and THA, the range of opioids prescribed varied significantly, by 1.6-fold for TKA and 2.8-fold for THA. Most studies reported pain outcomes (89%) and the use of nonopioid medications (72%). Of the 4 studies offering prescribing recommendations, the amounts ranged from 50 to 104 pills for TKA and 30 to 45 pills for THA.
Conclusions
Opioid prescribing exceeds the amount consumed following TKA and THA. These findings serve as a call to action to tailor prescribing guidelines to how much patients actually consume while emphasizing the use of nonopioid medications to better optimize recovery from surgery.

AB  - Cloud computing has brought the accessibility of several software platforms under a single roof. It has transformed resources into scalable services on demand and provides the only solution to the high resource requirements. All cloud service providers usually offer all types of services in the cloud computing environment, even though they also handle security-related challenges like reliability, availability, and throughput. One of the most decisive challenges in the cloud is handling faults. High fault tolerance in the cloud is a must to attain high performance, and the defects must be investigated and examined for future guidance. The principal target of this paper is to gain insight into the fault tolerance techniques that are available to us and the challenges that are required to be overcome. We concluded that there is always a relation between faults and energy consumption during our survey. If there is a high potential to tolerate a fault, there will be a need for more infrastructure and devices to fix those faults, which further leads to more power consumption. In this paper, 129 Research papers published through February 2022 were considered and further classified. This paper critically reviews techniques to toleratefaultsin cloud computing systems and discusses the taxonomy of errors, faults, and failures. Furthermore, this paper aims to investigate several critical research topics and advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, the Internet of Things, and machine learning, that may be employed as an intelligent fault tolerance strategy in the cloud environment.

Game Software Engineering (GSE) is a branch of Software Engineering (SE) that focuses on the development of video game applications. In past years, GSE has achieved enough volume, differences from traditional software engineering, and interest by the community to be considered an independent scientific domain, veering out from traditional SE.
Objective:
This study evaluates the current state of the art in software engineering for industry-scale computer games identifying gaps and consolidating the magnitude and growth of this field.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review is performed following best practices to ensure the relevance of the studies included in the review. We analyzed 98 GSE studies to extract the current intensity, topics, methods, and quality of GSE.
Results:
The GSE research community has been growing over the years, producing over four times more research than before the previous GSE survey. However, this community is still very dispersed, with no main venues holding most of the GSE scientific studies. A broader range of topics is covered in this area, evolving towards those of a mature field such as architecture and design. Also, the reviewed studies employ more elaborated empirical research methods, even though the study reports need to be more rigorous in sections related to the critical examination of the work.
Conclusion:
The results of the SLR lead to the identification of 13 potential future research directions for this domain. GSE is an independent, mature, and growing field that presents new ways of software creation where the gap between industry and academia is narrowing. Video games present themselves as powerful tools to push the boundaries of software knowledge.

AB  - Ten of the 27 species of Plateumaris Thomson (Chrysomelidae: Donaciinae) occur in the Palaearctic. Due to the intraspecific variation and the large distributions of some species, descriptions exist for at least 80 taxa plus five nomina nuda. The status of each valid species is clarified and the remaining 70 names are allocated as synonyms. New synonymies are P. tenuicornis Balthasar, considered a synonym of P. consimilis (Schrank), P. sulcifrons Weise as a synonym of P. rustica (Kunze), and P. caucasica Zaitzev as a synonym of P. sericea (Linnaeus). Two controversial synonyms are confirmed: P. discolor (Panzer) and P. sericea sibirica (Solsky) are both synonyms of P. sericea. Finally, P. obsoleta Jacobson is a synonym but at present it is not possible to decide whether it belongs to P. shirahatai Kimoto or to P. sericea. Forty-one new country records are added, compared with the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera published in 2010; 28 records are based on recently published records and 13 are first records for a specific country.

AB  - This review systematically explores the application of transformer-based models in EEG signal processing and brain-computer interface (BCI) development, with a distinct focus on ensuring methodological rigour and adhering to empirical validations within the existing literature. By examining various transformer architectures, such as the Temporal Spatial Transformer Network (TSTN) and EEG Conformer, this review delineates their capabilities in mitigating challenges intrinsic to EEG data, such as noise and artifacts, and their subsequent implications on decoding and classification accuracies across disparate mental tasks. The analytical scope extends to a meticulous examination of attention mechanisms within transformer models, delineating their role in illuminating critical temporal and spatial EEG features and facilitating interpretability in model decision-making processes. The discourse additionally encapsulates emerging works that substantiate the efficacy of transformer models in noise reduction of EEG signals and diversifying applications beyond the conventional motor imagery paradigm. Furthermore, this review elucidates evident gaps and propounds exploratory avenues in the applications of pre-trained transformers in EEG analysis and the potential expansion into real-time and multi-task BCI applications. Collectively, this review distils extant knowledge, navigates through the empirical findings, and puts forward a structured synthesis, thereby serving as a conduit for informed future research endeavours in transformer-enhanced, EEG-based BCI systems.

AB  - Context: Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice to automatically configure system dependencies and to provision local and remote instances. Practitioners consider IaC as a fundamental pillar to implement DevOps practices, which helps them to rapidly deliver software and services to end-users. Information technology (IT) organizations, such as GitHub, Mozilla, Facebook, Google and Netflix have adopted IaC. A systematic mapping study on existing IaC research can help researchers to identify potential research areas related to IaC, for example defects and security flaws that may occur in IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help researchers identify research areas related to infrastructure as code (IaC) by conducting a systematic mapping study of IaC-related research. Method: We conduct our research study by searching five scholar databases. We collect a set of 31,498 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes removing duplicates and removing non-English and non peer-reviewed publications, we identify 32 publications related to IaC. We identify topics addressed in these publications by applying qualitative analysis. Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) adoption of infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as code; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis, 50.0% of the studied 32 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that framework or tools is a well-studied topic in IaC research. As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the deployment and development environments in DevOps, we observe the need for research studies that will study defects and security flaws for IaC.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Natural medicines (NMs) are crucial for treating human diseases. Efficiently characterizing their bioactive components in vivo has been a key focus and challenge in NM research. High-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) systems offer high sensitivity, resolution, and precision for conducting in vivo analysis of NMs. However, due to the complexity of NMs, conventional data acquisition, mining, and processing techniques often fail to meet the practical needs of in vivo NM analysis. Over the past two decades, intelligent spectral data-processing techniques based on various principles and algorithms have been developed and applied for in vivo NM analysis. Consequently, improvements have been achieved in the overall analytical performance by relying on these techniques without the need to change the instrument hardware. These improvements include enhanced instrument analysis sensitivity, expanded compound analysis coverage, intelligent identification, and characterization of nontargeted in vivo compounds, providing powerful technical means for studying the in vivo metabolism of NMs and screening for pharmacologically active components. This review summarizes the research progress on in vivo analysis strategies for NMs using intelligent MS data processing techniques reported over the past two decades. It discusses differences in compound structures, variations among biological samples, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) neural network algorithms. Additionally, the review offers insights into the potential of in vivo tracking of NMs, including the screening of bioactive components and the identification of pharmacokinetic markers. The aim is to provide a reference for the integration and development of new technologies and strategies for future in vivo analysis of NMs.

AB  - The potential introduction of cultivated meat products to the market, framed as sustainable alternative to conventional animal-source foods, underscores the need to examine psychological barriers and predisposing factors influencing consumer acceptance. Familiarity is often considered a facilitating factor, based on the premise that higher familiarity with cultivated meat is associated with greater acceptance. However, evidence remains contradictory and poorly integrated. This review examines and organizes the literature on familiarity with cultivated meat and its influence on consumer acceptance. A scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted on June 7, 2024, following PRISMA-ScR and Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. Comprehensive searches across Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycInfo included no restrictions on participant type, geographic location, social and cultural contexts, language, or publication time. 63 articles were analyzed to examine (i) definitions of familiarity, (ii) methodologies measuring familiarity with cultivated meat, and (iii) evidence regarding its influence on consumer acceptance of cultivated meat. Results indicate that current research on familiarity is largely based on non-representative samples, with data recency limitations, and inconsistent operationalization. Familiarity is often conflated with the related yet distinct constructs of awareness and knowledge, revealing a lack of clarity in literature. The review also identified various approaches for assessing familiarity, all lacking psychometric rigor, hindering replicability and comparability of findings. This review highlights the need for further research to clarify the theoretical and operational definition of familiarity and its role in consumer acceptance of cultivated meat.

AB  - Context:
An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy). The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning. These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities which could result in catastrophic outcomes (e.g., loss of lives). Given the growing interest in employing assurance cases to ensure that systems are developed to meet their requirements, exploring the management of assurance weakeners becomes beneficial.
Objective:
As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.
Methods:
We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study. We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012–2023 publication year range. Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners from a qualitative standpoint, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.
Results:
Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them from a qualitative perspective. The taxonomy classifies weakeners in four categories: aleatory, epistemic, ontological, and argument uncertainty. Additionally, it classifies approaches supporting the management of weakeners in three main categories: representation, identification and mitigation approaches.
Conclusion:
Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) – a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) – offers a comprehensive range of capabilities to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners. Our findings also suggest novel assurance weakener management approaches should be proposed to better assure mission-critical systems.

Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a major concern for global health. However, factors driving its emergence and dissemination are not fully understood. Identification of such factors is crucial to explain heterogeneity in ABR rates observed across space, time, and species and antibiotics.
Methods
We analysed count data of clinical isolates from 51 countries over 2006–19 for thirteen drug-bacterium pairs taken from the ATLAS database. We characterised ABR spatial and temporal patterns and used a mixed-effect negative binomial model, accounting for country-year dependences with random effects, to investigate associations with potential drivers, including antibiotic sales, economic and health indicators, meteorological data, population density, and tourism.
Findings
ABR patterns were strongly country and drug–bacterium pair dependent. In 2019, median ABR rates ranged from 6·3% (IQR 19·7% [0·5–20·2]) for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae to 80·7% (41·8% [50·4–92·2]) for fluoroquinolone-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, with heterogeneity across countries. From 2006 to 2019, carbapenem resistance increased in more than 60% of investigated countries; no global trend was observed for other resistances. Multivariable analyses identified significant associations of ABR with country-level selecting antibiotic sales, but only in fluoroquinolone-resistant-Escherichia coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant-A baumannii. We also found a correlation between temperature and resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and with the health system quality for all drug–bacterium pairs except Enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae pairs. Despite wide consideration of possible explanatory variables, drug–bacterium pair ABR rates still showed unexplained spatial random effects variance.
Interpretation
Our findings reflect the diversity of mechanisms driving global antibiotic resistance across pathogens and stress the need for tailored interventions to tackle bacterial resistance.

AB  - Context
Web application security is a main component of any web-based business. Web applications are subject to attacks from different locations at various levels of scale and complexity. In this context, a large number of testing techniques, tools and frameworks have been proposed by both practitioners and researchers to effectively and efficiently test the security of web applications.
Objective
As the number of papers increases in the security of web applications and this research area matures, reviewing and getting an overview of this area is getting challenging for a practitioner or a new researcher. Our objective is to summarize the state-of-the-art in web application security testing which could benefit practitioners to potentially utilize that information.
Method
We review and structure the body of knowledge related to web application security testing in the form of a systematic literature mapping (SLM). As part of this study, we pose four sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a classification schema. The initial pool consisted of 154 articles. Systematic voting was conducted among the authors regarding the inclusion/exclusion of articles. As a result, there were 80 technical articles in our final pool. Accordance with our inclusion and exclusion criteria, the first article was published in 2005 and this review includes all the papers until the end of 2020. During December 2020, January and February 2021, the search phase has been conducted.
Results
This review paper provides an overview of web application security testing with different focused headings. These headings cover contribution types, web security testing tools and their sub features, specific questions/features to the security testing such as vulnerability types, system under testing (SUT) focused headings and more.
Conclusion
The results of this study would benefit researchers working on web application security testing. Also, it could be useful for developers who discuss application security while they develop web applications. Thanks to this paper, these researchers could utilize the all results and use them to catch the trend of web application security testing and secure development.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Platelets modulate vascular microenvironments via the release of cargo molecules. Granule secretion is modulated by proteins called Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptors (SNAREs). Secretion is complex and regulated by several protein-protein interactions; however, not all are characterized in platelets. We have identified Cysteine String Protein-α (CSPα; aka, DNAJC5 or CLN4) as required for platelet secretion. CSPα is the only member from the CSP family present in platelets and has been proposed as a chaperone for the SNAP-23/25 t (Qb,c)-SNAREs. To address CSPα’s role, we analyzed platelets from CSPα-/- mice. The loss of CSPα significantly affected dense- and α-granule release with minimal effects on lysosomal secretion. Consistent with the secretion defects, in vivo and ex vivo assays showed that loss of CSPα caused significant bleeding and attenuated thrombosis under flow. Interestingly, loss of CSPα caused a reduction in GPVI levels and reduced αIIbβ3 activation, especially in response to GPVI-specific agonists. Deletion of CSPα did not affect proteins in the platelet secretory machinery, e.g., the SNAP-23/25 proteins. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that CSPα, which is reported to be acylated, was present on membranes but not in lipid rafts. Immunofluorescence studies showed CSPα co-localized with α and lysosomal granules markers. CSPα-/- mice had reduced red blood cell, leukocyte, and megakaryocyte numbers, suggesting effects on bone marrow progenitor cells. Simultaneously, we detected increased collagen I deposition, but no fibrosis in the marrow of CSPα-/- mice. These results identify CSPα as another element of the platelet secretory machinery that significantly contributes to thrombosis and hemostasis.

AB  - Context:
The adoption or acceptance of new technologies or ways of working in software development activities is a recurrent topic in the software engineering literature. The topic has, therefore, been empirically investigated extensively. It is, however, unclear which theoretical frames of reference are used in this research to explain acceptance behaviors.
Objective:
In this study, we explore how major theories and models of acceptance behavior have been used in the software engineering literature to empirically investigate acceptance behavior.
Method:
We conduct a systematic mapping study of empirical studies using acceptance behavior theories in software engineering.
Results:
We identified 47 primary studies covering 56 theory uses. The theories were categorized into six groups. Technology acceptance models (TAM and its extensions) were used in 29 of the 47 primary studies, innovation theories in 10, and the theories of planned behavior/ reasoned action (TPB/TRA) in six. All other theories were used in at most two of the primary studies. The usage and operationalization of the theories were, in many cases, inconsistent with the underlying theories. Furthermore, we identified 77 constructs used by these studies of which many lack clear definitions.
Conclusions:
Our results show that software engineering researchers are aware of some of the leading theories and models of acceptance behavior, which indicates an attempt to have more theoretical foundations. However, we identified issues related to theory usage that make it difficult to aggregate and synthesize results across studies. We propose mitigation actions that encourage the consistent use of theories and emphasize the measurement of key constructs.

AB  - In the age of disruption, it is important for companies to have a supported product development in order to be able to bring complex products such as manufacturing systems to the market. Systems Engineering methods support these product development processes. However, because product development processes vary from company to company, methods need to be adapted to the company's needs and processes. In our paper, we examine the topic of Method Engineering (ME). Three main research questions were investigated. First, what is ME and how is it defined in literature? Second, what is the terminology associated with ME? And third, how can a standard method be adapted to stakeholder needs and tasks? Is there a universal approach? To answer the research questions, we have conducted a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database. The results provide a useful overview of the state of the art in ME. We have structured the results into definitions of the key terms, challenges, advantages, and prerequisites of ME. Finally, we present typical approaches described in the literature. The results provide an overview of the field of ME as well as information that can help companies to support their product development methodically. The results form the basis for industrial companies to understand the procedure of ME.

AB  - The protein p53 is a transcription factor with several key roles in cells, including acting as a tumour suppressor. In most human cancers its tumour suppressor function is inactivated, either through inhibition by negative regulators or by mutation in the TP53 gene. Thus, there is a high interest in developing molecules able to activate p53 tumour suppressor activity. Tryptophanol-derived isoindolinones are known to act as wild-type and mutant p53 activators. Specifically, SLMP53-1 is a non-fluorescent wild-type and mutant p53 R280K reactivator, with potent in vivo anti-tumour activity in HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 mice xenograft models. With the aim of studying tryptophanol-derived isoindolinones intracellular localization by fluorescence microscopy, three SLMP53-1 based fluorescent probes were prepared. Here we report the design, synthesis, photophysical characterization, antiproliferative activity and cell localization studies of these fluorescent probes. The previously described structure–activity relationships of the SLMP53-1 scaffold set the basis for the design the fluorescent probes. The probes were prepared by connecting a small fluorophore (dansyl or 7-nitrobenzofurazan) to the indole nitrogen of the tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinone SLMP53-1 through two different linkers. The antiproliferative activity and cell localization studies of the three fluorescent probes were performed in HCT116 cells. The three probes showed enhanced internalization when compared with their fluorophore-linker intermediates, good photo-stability and high affinity for the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating the potential involvement of endoplasmic reticulum in the mechanism of action of tryptophanol-derived oxazoloisoindolinones.

AB  - Background:
Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience symptom relief of certain foods and earlier research has shown positive effects of food and food components on clinical outcomes of RA. Food components may potentiate each other in their effects on RA, but even so, studies combining foods and food components with probable effects on RA are scarce. Furthermore, comorbidities are common in RA and the risk of cardiovascular disease is elevated in this group. Assumed mechanisms include classical risk factors such as systemic inflammation, dyslipidemia as well as an unfavorable body composition.
Objectives:
We investigated if a diet combining foods with anti-inflammatory effects, i.e. an anti-inflammatory portfolio diet, could reduce RA disease activity, markers of inflammation, body composition and blood lipid levels compared to a control diet.
Methods:
In this controlled cross-over trial, 50 patients with RA were randomized to start with either intervention or control diet for ten weeks followed by a wash-out period of four months. The intervention diet was an anti-inflammatory portfolio diet containing foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fibers and probiotics. The control diet was a typical Swedish diet. Food equivalent to 50% of daily energy needs was delivered home weekly. For the remaining intake, participants were instructed to consume similar foods as the study diet regimen. Primary outcome measure was change in DAS28, using ESR. Secondary outcomes included changes in blood lipid levels, ESR and CRP as well as body composition.
Results:
No significant difference in DAS28 between the groups was seen using Mixed Models analyze (p=0.116). However, DAS28 was significantly lower after the intervention diet compared to after control diet (p=0.04) and a significant reduction over time was seen in the intervention group (p=0.012) using Wilcoxon signed rank test. HDL-cholesterol was increased and TG were lowered after intervention compared to control, analyzed using Mixed Models (p=0.046 and p=0.006 respectively). In addition, there was a non-significant trend towards lowered LDL-cholesterol (p=0.077). Comparing after intervention to after control, there were non-significant lower weight, BMI and fat mass after the intervention (p=0.077, p=0.075 and p=0.058 respectively). None of the other outcomes changed significantly between groups.
Conclusion:
This study showed positive effects on disease activity and blood lipid levels of a diet combining foods with anti-inflammatory properties, but the results must be confirmed in larger studies.

AB  - Applications of Machine Learning methods make a paradigm shift in the domain of water resources engineering. This study not only presents the story of emerging eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) but also encompasses a thorough review XGBoost utilization to problems in hydrology, hydraulics, and hydroclimatology. According to the literature, XGBoost was employed for hydrological modelling, forecasting water quantity and quality, and groundwater management. In the context of hydraulic modelling, the review assessed XGBoost performances for estimating scouring and sediment transport, reservoir modelling, open channel and pressurized flow predictions, and hydraulic structure. Additionally, the role of XGBoost in forecasting hydroclimatic variables, drought assessment, and statistical downscaling was discussed. The review revealed that in 74% of papers, XGBoost or a hybrid XGBoost-based model resulted in the best results among other ML models in diverse applications. Finally, the study presents some suggestions for future studies in the context of XGBoost applications.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The continuous improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients raises interest in evaluating peripheral residual disease (PRD) towards more frequent readouts of tumor kinetics while preserving quality of life. Here we present BloodFlow, a new method that combines immunomagnetic enrichment of CD138+ circulating plasma cells in peripheral blood (PB) with next-generation flow (NGF), for the detection of PRD below the 2x10-6 NGF threshold. BloodFlow detected PRD in 55/644 (8.5%) PB samples collected from 295 MM patients. Of note, 29/55 (52.7%) PB samples were positive using BloodFlow and negative by NGF. The lowest level of PRD detected by BloodFlow was 6x10-8. Considering patients’ minimal residual disease (MRD) status in bone marrow as the reference, BloodFlow showed positive and negative predictive values of 95.1% and 76.6%. Presence of PRD during maintenance or observation predicted dismal progression-free and overall survival (2-year rates of 0% and 62%). BloodFlow surpassed NGF in PB and retained independent prognostic value for PFS in multivariate analysis including transplant-eligibility, the Revised International Staging System, complete remission and MRD status in bone marrow. BloodFlow is the first flow cytometry method that detects tumor cells below the 10-6 threshold, which resulted in improved minimally-invasive monitoring of MM patients.

The proposed approach leverages the Battery Parameter eXchange standard to introduce a parameter porting framework that supports the implementation of equivalent cell parameters across suites, and provides a method for solver tolerance selection used for computational speed comparison. The methodology is showcased by comparing two of the most comprehensive open-source suites, PyBaMM and TOOFAB. While both provide lean model implementation, PyBaMM shows more versatility and faster mean simulation times, with TOOFAB closing the gap on simulations with coarser discretizations, particularly when order reductions are applied. Furthermore, considering portability to C and implementation simplicity, TOOFAB has a strong advantage.

AB  - Objectives
To conduct a scoping review on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in clear aligner therapy and to assess the extent of AI integration and automation in orthodontic software currently available to orthodontists.
Data and sources
A systematic electronic literature search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Also, grey literature resources up to March 2024 were reviewed. English-language studies on potential AI applications for clear aligner therapy were included based on an independent evaluation by two reviewers. An assessment of the automation steps in orthodontic software available on the market up to March 2024 was also conducted.
Study selection and results
Out of 708 studies, 41 were included. Sixteen articles focused on tooth segmentation, four on registration of digital models, 13 on digital setup, and eight on remote monitoring. Moreover, 13 aligner software programs were identified and assessed for their level of automation. Only one software demonstrated complete automation of the steps involved in the orthodontic digital workflow.
Conclusions
None of the 13 identified aligner software programs were evaluated in the 41 included studies. However, AI-based tooth segmentation achieved 98 % accuracy, while AI effectively merged CBCT and IOS data, supported digital measurements, predicted treatment outcomes, and showed potential for remote monitoring.
Clinical significance
AI applications in clear aligner therapy are on the rise. This scoping review enables orthodontists to identify AI-based solutions in orthodontic planning and understand its implications, which can potentially enhance treatment efficiency, accuracy, and predictability.

AB  - Over and above technical skills, software development graduates need to also poses team-based skills, such as, leadership, oral communication and project management by the time they graduate from tertiary institutions. In order to fulfil this requirement, institutions introduced a project-based module, generally referred to as capstone, to be undertaken by students on the their final year. The essence of this module, amongst other things, is to expose students to the real-world professional experience through partnership with industry. Much research has been conducted on students software projects, but very little investigation has gone into understanding how students evaluate the success of their projects. In is in this light that this study was conducted. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed on empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022, to establish criteria used by students in evaluating software project success. The investigation led to the discovery of one (1) paper, which identified three most important success criteria used by students. However, this study identified some short-comings (eg students had to pretend to be employed graduates when evaluating the imaginary projects) with the approach used by the abovementioned research paper in determining the students’ success criteria. Beside the fact that there is only one study that was found that addresses the study’s phenomenon, the identified short-comings on the paper indicate that there is a need for empirical research studies on this matter.

AB  - In this digital era, teachers are expected to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) tools to enhance traditional teaching methods with modern technology. Therefore, this systematic review addressed research questions regarding the challenges, the role of stakeholders, and strategies that enable effective integration of ICT tools in secondary education. It analysed 54 scholarly and peer-reviewed publications between 2008 and 2023 sampled from electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Eric). The main findings indicated that effective integration of ICT tools should address professional development, improve knowledge and skills, and resolve systemic challenges. Results highlight the significant role of policymakers in nurturing an innovative, collaborative, and supportive school environment. They additionally indicated that school leaders should ensure the availability, accessibility, reliability, compatibility, and security of ICT tools. Similarly, teachers should assist students in changing attitudes, beliefs, and practices towards ICT tools by supporting and facilitating practical and meaningful skills development opportunities. On the other hand, students should embrace a supportive, collaborative, and innovative school environment. Hence, recommendations include exploring the long-term effects of ICT integration on educational outcomes with the proliferation of AI and its impact on educational outcomes, sustainability, and adaptability in secondary schools.

AB  - The efficient configuration of supply chains is a current challenge for deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a key element of the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Despite advances in the modeling of biorefinery location siting, transportation network design, and co-products use, current supply chains and business models for renewable fuel production do not result in costs that are competitive with fossil fuels. Various elements for process efficiency enhancement, risk mitigation, total cost reduction, and profit maximization have been studied in supply chain design. In this work, we study the conceptual components needed for the design and analysis of supply chains. We emphasize the impact that monetization of environmental and social services could have on the overall viability of SAF production. The current state of the supply chain configuration of SAF is compared with other supply chain and value-chain strategies, mainly: (1) lean, used for staple commodities, (2) agile, intended for innovative products and services, (3) green, meant to reduce the environmental impacts, and (4) risk-adverse, used to minimize supply risk disruptions. A summary of models and simulation approaches used to synthesize and solve supply chain problems is included. Our review highlights the uniqueness of the supply chain for SAF and proposes ways to enrich the existing approach with methods used by other industries. The SAF business model could be improved by including ecosystem and social services to generate additional revenue. New strategies accounting for the dynamic interactions between the components of the supply chain of SAF, including services, are needed.

AB  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world’s population, with approximately 266 million cases and 5 million deaths to date. COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation led to vaccine hesitancy among the public, particularly in vulnerable communities, which persists today. Social media companies are attempting to curb the ongoing spread of an overwhelming amount of COVID-19 misinformation on their platforms. In response to this problem, the authors hosted INFODEMIC: A Stanford Conference on Social Media and COVID-19 Misinformation (INFODEMIC) to develop best practices for social media companies to mitigate online misinformation and disinformation.
Objective
The primary aim of this study was to develop recommendations for social media companies to address the COVID-19 infodemic. We report the methods used to execute the INFODEMIC conference, conference attendee engagement and analytics, and a qualitative thematic analysis of the conference presentations. The primary study outcomes were the identified themes and corresponding recommendations.
Methods
Using a constructivist paradigm, we conducted a thematic analysis of the 6-hour conference transcript to develop best practice recommendations. The INFODEMIC conference was the study intervention, the conference speakers were the study participants, and transcripts of their presentations were the data for this study. We followed the 6-step framework for thematic analysis described by Braun and Clarke. We also used descriptive statistics to report measures of conference engagement including registrations, viewership, post-conference asynchronous participation, and conference evaluations.
Results
A total of 26 participants spoke at the virtual conference and represented a wide array of occupations, expertise, and countries of origin. From their remarks, we identified 18 response categories and 4 themes: trust, equity, social media practices, and interorganizational partnerships. From these, a total of 16 best practice recommendations were formulated for social media companies, health care organizations, and the general public. These recommendations focused on rebuilding trust in science and medicine among certain communities, redesigning social media platforms and algorithms to reduce the spread of misinformation, improving partnerships between key stakeholders, and educating the public to critically analyze online information. Of the 1090 conference registrants, 587 (53.9%) attended the live conference, and another 9996 individuals viewed or listened to the conference recordings asynchronously. Conference evaluations averaged 8.9 (best=10).
Conclusions
Social media companies play a significant role in the COVID-19 infodemic and should adopt evidence-based measures to mitigate misinformation on their platforms.

KW  - Single Center Expansion Library
KW  - SCE molecular properties
KW  - Electron–molecule scattering
AB  - SCELib is a computer program which implements the Single Center Expansion (SCE) method to describe molecular electronic densities and the interaction potentials between a charged projectile (electron or positron) and a target molecular system. The first version (CPC Catalog identifier ADMG_v1_0) was submitted to the CPC Program Library in 2000, version 2.0 (ADMG_v2_0) was submitted in 2004 and version 3.0 (ADMG_v3_0) was submitted in 2009. We here announce the new release 4.0 which presents additional features with respect to the previous versions aiming at a significant enhancement of its capabilities to deal with larger molecular systems. In SCELib 4.0 we implemented an automatic R grid generator based on a screened nuclear potential. By coupling the R generator with a parametric θ,ϕ definition of the angular grid, one is then able to define the 3D grid which best follows the molecular shape of systems as large as nucleotides and DNA fragments. The list of supported architectures has been updated and the code already ported in v3.0 to hybrid platforms based on NVIDIA GPU, has now been fully ported in double precision arithmetic and parallelized with MPI under either Linux or Microsoft Windows operating systems. The resulting benchmarks of the new code will be discussed in details and for the first time we present the performance test on a system as large as the Cytidine Mono Phosphate (CMP) which at present is the largest system ever simulated with this and related kind of codes.
Program summary
Program Title: SCELib4.0 Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5g2fkkvw87.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C External routines/libraries: CUDA libraries, SDK and Toolkit V4.2/9.0 (backward compatible with V3.2), (C)BLAS libraries, OpenMPI 1.6+. Journal reference of previous versions: F. A. Gianturco and N. Sanna, Comp. Phys. Comm., 128 139 (2000). N. Sanna and G. Morelli, Comp. Phys. Comm., 162 51 (2004). N. Sanna, I. Baccarelli and G. Morelli, Comp. Phys. Comm., 180 2544 (2009). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: In this set of codes an efficient procedure is implemented to describe the wavefunction and related molecular properties of a polyatomic molecular system within the Single Center of Expansion (SCE) approximation. The resulting SCE wavefunction, electron density, electrostatic and correlation/polarization potentials can then be used in a wide variety of applications, such as electron–molecule scattering calculations, quantum chemistry studies, biomodelling and drug design. Solution method: The polycentre Hartree–Fock solution for a molecule of arbitrary geometry, based on linear combination of Gaussian-Type Orbital (GTO), is expanded over a single centre, typically the Centre Of Mass (C.O.M.), by means of a Gauss–Legendre/Chebyschev quadrature over the θ,ϕ angular coordinates. The resulting SCE numerical wavefunction is then used to calculate the one-particle electron density, the electrostatic potential and two different models for the correlation/polarization potentials induced by the impinging electron, which have the correct asymptotic behaviour for the leading dipole molecular polarizabilities. Reasons for the new version: The present release of SCELib allows to study larger molecular systems with respect to the previous versions by means of theoretical and technological advances, with the first implementation of an automatic generation of the R,θ,ϕ grid and a full double precision arithmetic parallel implementation of the whole package with MPI over an unlimited large many-core computing system. Summary of revisions: The major features added with respect to SCELib Version 3.0 are: 1. the implementation of the automatic R grid generator based on a screened nuclear potential able in principle to accurately take into account the molecular shape of any chemical system. 2. the calculation of SCE static potential multipoles either in spherical and cartesian coordinates to better evaluate single centre expansion by direct numerical comparison of spherical with respect to GTO polycentric electrostatic moments. 3. the parallel porting of the most time consuming parts of the code over the standard OpenMPI (Open Message Passing Interface) communication library. 4. A full double-precision (DP) representation for real numbers in the SCE mapping of the GTOs (the sphint function) has been implemented into the new code thus having the whole computing workflow fully run in DP. 5. the porting of the whole package on the Windows operating system. 6. the porting to BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library of all the eligible parts of the code. 7. the full reshaping of the memory allocation model to provide better performance on large distributed memory architecture. 8. extended support to recent nVIDIA GPU including the latest Kepler, Pascal and Volta based boards. 9. few minor bug-fixes and input data optimization. Restrictions: Depending on the molecular system under study and on the operating runtime conditions the program may or may not fit into available host RAM memory. In this cases, although the feature of the program to operate with memory mapped on disk file has been removed, the extension of SCELib to MPI could easily enable the end user to add memory by including more nodes to fit the RAM needs at runtime. The parallel MPI/p-threads GPU implementation limits the number of CPU threads to the number of GPU processors present on a single node. This behaviour has been implemented for performance reasons (letting most of the instructions to be issued onto the GPU) but the code can be configured at compile time to use any combination of CPU cores and GPU boards.

AB  - Life cycle engineering is a crucial design methodology to support optimized design choices in the context of ecodesign, particularly for components manufactured with novel technologies such as additive manufacturing. This study presents a systematic literature review on the topic, analysing 87 publications following the PRISMA framework. The review explores the environmental and economic life cycle implications of additive manufacturing in relation to the technological features and engineering design aspects. Additionally, it shows existing frameworks for integrating ecodesign into sustainability assessments of additive manufacturing and the development of ecodesign guidelines. From an engineering perspective, these technologies introduce several advantages enabling the creation of lightweight, multi-functional, and performance-optimized components. However, challenges related to high energy consumption, material preparation, and variability in life cycle impacts need to be addressed with dedicated life cycle analysis to ensure environmental and economic sustainability. Existing methods for integrating ecodesign into life cycle assessment are fragmented, with limited frameworks combining environmental and economic aspects. Emerging approaches, such as automated life cycle assessment tools, show promise but remain underexplored. Ecodesign guidelines emphasize well-known strategies such as material optimization and waste reduction. Nonetheless, translating these guidelines into standardized practices remains a challenge. This review highlights the need for comprehensive and standardized life cycle engineering frameworks to guide sustainable design decisions throughout all product life cycle phases, ensuring that additive manufacturing technologies fulfil their potential as enablers of environmentally and economically sustainable manufacturing.

AB  - SUMMARY
Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace metal required for normal biological function, yet it also poses neurotoxic risks when dysregulated. Maintaining proper intracellular and extracellular Mn levels is critical, as Mn imbalance has been implicated in a spectrum of human diseases—including inherited Mn transport disorders, acquired manganism, and more prevalent neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite these associations, the cellular mechanisms driving Mn-induced neuropathology remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain neuronal model using patient lines with mutations in SLC39A14, SLC39A8, and SLC30A10. Through integrated transcriptomic and functional analyses, we found that Mn dyshomeostasis disrupts essential neuronal pathways, including mitochondrial bioenergetics, calcium signaling, endocytosis, glycosylation, and stress responses—leading to early neurodegeneration. This humanized model advances our understanding of Mn’s impact on neuronal health and disease and highlights potential molecular targets for future therapeutic interventions in Mn-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, the long time span from leukapheresis to actual CAR T-cell infusion often necessitates bridging therapies. Due to limited knowledge about the effects of bridging on post-CAR-T clinical course and outcomes, the selection of treatment options is challenging. In this multicenter international observational study, we explored the impact of bridging therapy on hematopoietic reconstitution in 158 patients with RRMM treated with B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CAR T-cell therapy. Based on exposure to classical cytotoxic (CTX) chemotherapy, we classified bridging regimens as non-CTX, intermediate CTX (1-2 CTX agents) or intensive CTX (≥ 3 CTX agents or high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation). We found associations between the number of cytotoxic agents used and impaired post-CAR-T hematopoietic reconstitution, evident across hematopoietic cell lineages and particularly manifesting during the late post-CAR-T period. Intensive CTX bridging was associated with a prolonged time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, distinct patterns of hematopoietic recovery (e.g., an intermittent phenotype characterized by a second drop), an increased susceptibility to severe infections and a significantly increased risk for severe late cytopenias in uni- and multivariate models. Taken together, these results highlight that bridging intensity distinctly shapes the trajectory of hematopoietic recovery after BCMA CAR-T. Targeted and novel immunotherapies could provide alternatives for bridging, and high-risk patients may particularly benefit from enhanced monitoring, prophylaxis and supportive care.

AB  - Context:
As the diversity and complexity of regulations affecting Software-Intensive Products and Services (SIPS) is increasing, software engineers need to address the growing regulatory scrutiny. We argue that, as with any other non-negotiable requirements, SIPS compliance should be addressed early in SIPS engineering—i.e., during requirements engineering (RE).
Objectives:
In the conditions of the expanding regulatory landscape, existing research offers scattered insights into regulatory compliance of SIPS. This study addresses the pressing need for a structured overview of the state of the art in software RE and its contribution to regulatory compliance of SIPS.
Method:
We conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview of the current state of research regarding challenges, principles, and practices for regulatory compliance of SIPS related to RE. We focused on the role of RE and its contribution to other SIPS lifecycle process areas. We retrieved 6914 studies published from 2017 (January 1) until 2023 (December 31) from four academic databases, which we filtered down to 280 relevant primary studies.
Results:
We identified and categorized the RE-related challenges in regulatory compliance of SIPS and their potential connection to six types of principles and practices addressing challenges. We found that about 13.6% of the primary studies considered the involvement of both software engineers and legal experts in developing principles and practices. About 20.7% of primary studies considered RE in connection to other process areas. Most primary studies focused on a few popular regulation fields (privacy, quality) and application domains (healthcare, software development, avionics). Our results suggest that there can be differences in terms of challenges and involvement of stakeholders across different fields of regulation.
Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the need for an in-depth investigation of stakeholders’ roles, relationships between process areas, and specific challenges for distinct regulatory fields to guide research and practice.

AB  - Stress is an intensified reaction that occurs when humans experience challenges(stressors) due to complex and nonlinear responses. The study proposes a pattern-driven framework that combines signal and image-based modalities, incorporating Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Local Normal Derivative Pattern (LNDP), Local Derivative Pattern (LDP), and Local Tetra Pattern (LTrP) using Spectrogram. Derived from the analyzed patterns, features spanning in the Time Domain, Non-Linear chaos theory, Fractal Dimensions, and Histogram descriptors are extracted. This study employs binary classification techniques to identify stress by distinguishing between baseline and stress states in multi-modality sensor data, such as heart rate (HR), and respiration rate (RR). In signal analysis, statistical and non-linear features related to the predictability of stress attained the high classification accuracy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on its linearity. Logistic Regression (LG) with its data complexity has obtained a good accuracy for overall features. For image analysis, the LBP technique exhibits strong overall classification performance for statistical at 98.7 %, entropy and histogram at 100 %, and fractals at 90 % compared with methods. Specifically, for LNDP and LTrP, Logistic Regression and Ensemble outperform SVM, achieving an impressive accuracy of 100 %, and superior performance metrics such as Precision, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Kappa Score based on the distribution of pixel intensities and directionality of pattern images as 0.4 to 1. The AlexNet gives good classification accuracy for Image Analysis of stress detection. Based on the intricate patterns at different scales, image analysis of spectrograms and pattern techniques yields better classification accuracy compared with signal analysis for stress prediction.

AB  - Objective
Differences in cost, utilization and quality of care provided by primary care physicians (PCPs) versus nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) were examined to determine savings and address PCPs shortage.
Methods
The Military Data Repository, which includes claims records for beneficiaries in the Military Health System, was used. Active-duty service members (ADSMs), retirees and military dependents diagnosed with mTBI between 2011 and 2021 were included. Total cost, relative value units and quality indicators of primary visits were dependent variables. The sample was stratified into patient-risk categories (high, low) and evaluation and management services (new and established patients).
Results
Per military patients, PAs and NPs provided care at lower cost than PCPs, savings of $53.2 to $99.9 and $72.0 to $275.5, respectively. Per dependent patient, PAs provided care at lower cost than PCPs, savings of $64.3 to $91.1; NPs provided care at lower cost than PCPs, savings of $71.4 and $81.6 per patient. For quality for military patients, PAs ordered fewer brain and spine imaging (4.2%) and conducted fewer depression assessments (6%) than PCPs for “new/high” risk patients. NPs conducted a higher proportion of neuropsychological testing (1.6%) for “existing/high” risk patients compared to PCPs. For dependents, PAs conducted more risk assessments and physical exams (2.5%) for “existing/low” risk patients compared to PCPs. 7.5% of “new/low” risk patients treated by NPs than PCPs experienced fewer readmissions.
Conclusion
NPs and PAs provide services for mTBI at lower costs than PCPs, with mixed results for quality.

AB  - Background and aims
Tofacitinib and upadacitinib are Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors that are increasingly used for the treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). However, comparative analyses of safety and effectiveness have not been performed for their use in this setting.
Methods
This multicenter, retrospective study enrolled hospitalized adult patients treated with tofacitinib or upadacitinib for ASUC between January 2019 and June 2024. The main outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission, and colectomy-free survival. Propensity-adjusted analyses using inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW), and double robust estimations (DRE) were used to control for confounding factors.
Results
In total, 111 patients (60 tofacitinib, 51 upadacitinib) were enrolled across 23 international centers. JAK inhibitors were used to induce response in 86 (77%) patients and used to maintain response after adequate intravenous steroid response in 25 (23%). The median follow up was 31 weeks (IQR 13-64). Between days 3-7 after treatment initiation, upadacitinib was associated with greater response rates 84% vs.54%,p=0.02 but response/remission were comparable at day 98 (45%/36% vs 55/48%) and day 182 (29/29% vs. 39/34%). Sub-analyses for JAK inhibitor use as salvage therapy (tofacitinib (n=35) vs. upadacitinib (n=31)) showed similar effectiveness outcomes across both groups. The probabilities of colectomy-free survival at days 98/182 for tofacitinib and upadacitinib were 79%/75% and 80%/78%, respectively, with no significant differences in the comparison of survival curves, p=0.99. Treatment failure rates (where JAK inhibitor was used to maintain remission) were similar at days 98 and 182. The frequency of adverse events was comparable.
Conclusion
Tofacitinib and upadacitinib appear to have similar effectiveness and safety profiles when used for the treatment of ASUC.

AB  - Objectives
Synthetic materials have been used for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). During the last 25 years, these materials were composed mostly of polypropylene (PP), whereas recently the use of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) is of increasing interest due to its characteristics. This study aimed to compare the results after SUI/POP surgery using PVDF versus PP materials by synthesizing the data of relevant existing literature.
Study design
This systematic review and meta-analysis included clinical trials, case-control studies, or cohort studies written in the English language. The search strategy included the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane, and grey literature (congresses IUGA, EUGA, AUGS, FIGO). All studies have to provide numeric data or odds ratios (OR) of developing a specific outcome in surgeries with PVDF compared with outcomes of other used materials. No restrictions of race or ethnicity were applied, nor chronological restrictions. Exclusion criteria were studies that included patients with cognitive impairment, dementia, stroke, or central nervous system trauma. All studies were screened by two reviewers, initially by title and abstract, and afterward by full text. Disagreements were resolved through mutual consent. All studies were assessed for their quality and bias risk. Data were extracted using a data extraction form formulated in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Our results were divided into studies dealing only with SUI patients, studies dealing only with POP patients, and cumulative analysis of variables expressed in both SUI and POP surgery. The primary outcomes were the rates of post-operative recurrence, mesh erosion, and postoperative pain after surgery with PVDF compared to PP. The secondary outcomes were post-operative sexual dissatisfaction, overall satisfaction rates, hematoma, urinary tract infection, de novo urge incontinence, and reoperation rate.
Results
No differences in the post-operative rates of SUI/POP recurrence, mesh erosion, and pain were found after surgery with PVDF vs surgery with PP. Patients after SUI surgery with PVDF tapes had statistically significant lower rates of de-novo urgency compared to the PP group [OR = 0.38 (0.18, 0.88), p = 0.01]; patients after POP surgery with PVDF materials had statistically significant lower rates of de-novo sexual dysfunction compared to the PP group [OR = 0.12 (0.03, 0.46), p = 0.002].
Conclusions
This study provided evidence that the use of PVDF in SUI/POP surgeries could be a valid alternative to PP. However our results are limited by uncertainty due to the overall low quality of the existent data. Further research and validation would contribute to better surgical techniques.
