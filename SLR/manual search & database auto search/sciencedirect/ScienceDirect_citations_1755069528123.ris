AB  - Live streaming user-generated video (UGV), a nascent format of crowdsourced content, has grown massive popularity among social media users and is believed to have substantial potential business influences. However, industry practitioners express concerns regarding this new form on social media platforms and the influences of live streaming UGV consumption lack research. Motivated such, through a uniquely merged dataset from the video game industry, we conduct a series of panel time-series empirical analyses to investigate the business value of live streaming UGV consumption. Further, we propose a conceptual framework based on the sense of community literature to understand the consequences of live streaming UGV consumption and verify it through several online experiments. This research contributes to the IS literature by shedding light on the influences of emergent crowdsourced content, providing a conceptual framework to existing literature, and offering rich managerial implications and guidelines to managers regarding utilizing live streaming UGVs.

AB  - Operational forecasting often requires predicting collections of related, multivariate time series data that are high-dimensional in nature. This can be tackled by fitting a single function to all series (global approach) or assuming each series as a separate prediction problem and fitting one function to each (local approach) – the global–local trade-off. Deep learning models inspired by different data generation processes aim to combine the benefits of global and local approaches. Specifically, these frequently propose feeding the statistical expressiveness of classical local models into more complex global networks. Following recent trends in neural networks, the theoretical foundations of these hybrid models can also explain the surge of Transformer-based time series forecasting applications, which showcase potential benefits for the global and local equilibrium. Dynamic reinforcement learning (RL) models have also been explored to optimize the balance of global and local signals in general prediction problems, frequently through Q-learning algorithms. RL models can be proposed to dynamically adjust the influence of global versus local information to improve predictive performance at both scales. This paper conducted a concise literature review focused on these two research streams to optimize the balance between globality and locality in forecasting collections of time series. It focuses on their evolution across time and hints at opportunities to close some of the research gaps by intersecting both propositions. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines and achieved a selection of 143 publications since 2000. The main findings reveal that global models have achieved strong expressiveness in capturing the most complex structural patterns while still enabling probabilistic outcomes to be delivered through uncertainty estimates. On the other hand, RL based methods depict great benefits in mitigating the risks of generalization by imprinting contextual diversity when predicting each step ahead for each series. Within those, the adoption of other computational learning or evolutionary-based methods (e.g. Genetic Programming) to improve the parametrization of the learning policies is also highlighted as an area of future work yet to be uncovered. This review advances knowledge at the intersection of two distinct yet potentially complementary research areas, identifying opportunities to combine different methodological approaches in addressing the global–local trade-off in forecasting collections of time series. This is achieved by surfacing shared limitations in current research and presenting avenues for integrating distinct methodologies, namely by further developing the theoretical underpinnings of reinforcement learning techniques. With this work we seek to enhance understanding of the relevant research landscape and help inform future solutions by establishing a foundation for collaborative work.

AB  - Objective
To evaluate the possible association between radon exposure and kidney cancer.
Methods
We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis based on random effect models to provide a pooled association measure.
Results
We subjected 8 studies (overall relative risks and 95% confidence intervals: 1.01, 0.72 to 1.43, I2 = 64.4%) to meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed a marginally significant association between radon exposure and kidney cancer in studies conducted in Europe. Two population-based studies provided no evidence for the increased risk of kidney cancer in the general population.
Conclusion
The association between radon and kidney cancer remains unclear but cannot be excluded because of its biological plausibility and the limited number and quality of existing studies. Additional data from the general population and well-designed miner cohort studies are needed to reveal the real relationship between radon exposure and kidney cancer.

At first, I determined the bias and discrimination, their blur boundary between two definitions from the legal perspective, then went into the details of the causes of bias in each stage of AI system development, mainly as the results of bias data sources and human decisions in the past, society and political contexts, and the developers’ ethics. In the same chapter, I presented the non-discrimination legal framework, including their application and convergence with the administration laws in regard to the automated decision making and support systems, as well as the involvement of ethics and regulations on personal data protection.

AB  - Background
Epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that higher folate intake is associated with decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk; however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully understood. Genetic variation that may have a direct or indirect impact on folate metabolism can provide insights into folate’s role in CRC.
Objectives
Our aim was to perform a genome-wide interaction analysis to identify genetic variants that may modify the association of folate on CRC risk.
Methods
We applied traditional case-control logistic regression, joint 3-degree of freedom, and a 2-step weighted hypothesis approach to test the interactions of common variants (allele frequency >1%) across the genome and dietary folate, folic acid supplement use, and total folate in relation to risk of CRC in 30,550 cases and 42,336 controls from 51 studies from 3 genetic consortia (CCFR, CORECT, GECCO).
Results
Inverse associations of dietary, total folate, and folic acid supplement with CRC were found (odds ratio [OR]: 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.96; and 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.94 per quartile higher intake, and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.88) for users compared with nonusers, respectively). Interactions (P-interaction < 5×10-8) of folic acid supplement and variants in the 3p25.2 locus (in the region of Synapsin II [SYN2]/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 [TIMP4]) were found using traditional interaction analysis, with variant rs150924902 (located upstream to SYN2) showing the strongest interaction. In stratified analyses by rs150924902 genotypes, folate supplementation was associated with decreased CRC risk among those carrying the TT genotype (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.86) but increased CRC risk among those carrying the TA genotype (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.05), suggesting a qualitative interaction (P-interaction = 1.4×10-8). No interactions were observed for dietary and total folate.
Conclusions
Variation in 3p25.2 locus may modify the association of folate supplement with CRC risk. Experimental studies and studies incorporating other relevant omics data are warranted to validate this finding.

AB  - Abstract:
At present, the underlying models of electrical simulations (device) are mainly two-dimensional and concern the DDM (drift diffusion model), relevant currents being induced by carrier drift (mainly under an electric field), electrons or holes, with concurrent diffusion of carrier packets.
Summary
For the past 40 years, the drift diffusion model has been at the heart of the electrical modeling of devices in terms of microelectronics; divergence of current density and “Poisson” are coupled equations. However, for 30 years now, devices have been getting smaller and smaller, and expert physicists and electronics engineers have been interested in backward master equations that are more fundamental like the Boltzmann equation. For 20 years now, eminent mathematicians have been interested in these integro-differential equations, looking for a possible bridge between the two. Furthermore, quantum mechanics has become increasingly pertinent. In fact, we are entering nanoelectronics, which should prompt researchers to come up with various paradigms in practice and partial or whole new sets of equations.

AB  - In recent years, mechanical characteristics including vibration, bending, buckling and postbuckling, stability and instability, etc. of small-scaled structures (such as micro/nanowires, micro and nano plates, micro and nano tubes, micro and nano beams, carbon micro/nano-tubes, micro and nano shells, micro and nano probes, etc.) have been broadly investigated, because of recent advances in nanotechnologies and due to their astonishing characteristics. Also, these small-scaled structures are extensively applied in several areas. However, comprehending the mechanical characteristics of these small-scaled structures is of great prominence and yet a daunting task. To understand the mechanical behaviors and capture the effects (including small-scale effect) of these different advanced small-scaled structures (at micro and nano levels), it is very essential to implement them into classical/nonclassical continuum elasticity based on a suitable classical/nonclassical elasticity formulation or theory. Thus, this work searches the literature and hereby presents an ample literature review study with a special focus primarily on the novel progress of vibration analyses of microplates and nanoplates using nonlocal/nonclassical continuum theories of elasticity. Scopus and web of science databases were used as the primary scholarly-databases to acquire the documents reviewed in the current research. Furthermore, several perspectives of classifications are considered while reviewing and grouping these acquired documents. The main purpose was to illustrate existing research trends in the vibrational analysis of small-scaled plate-based structures utilizing nonlocal plate-based theories and nonclassical continuum elasticity theories, and to provide a foundation and guidance for future research on the mechanics of small-scaled plate-based structures.

AB  - A data catalog enables an organization to maintain an inventory of its data assets by collecting and managing the relevant metadata. We conducted a systematic multi-vocal literature review on data catalogs to understand their features and usage. We systematically selected and analyzed 86 literature sources and 39 catalog tools. We first utilized the findings from the literature to develop a classification framework comprising 24 fine-grained and five high-level features, along with three maturity levels. Next, we analyzed 39 tools based on the classification framework. Organizations typically include a data catalog as a component in their big data platforms and use it to support the various phases of the metadata management lifecycle. Hence, we also mapped the catalog features to the requirements of metadata-driven big data architectures, namely data mesh, data lake, and data lakehouse. Moreover, the mappings of the features to the phases in a metadata management lifecycle were developed. Our findings shall aid organizations in making informed decisions when choosing data catalog tools and help researchers identify the critical research issues in data cataloging and metadata management. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.

AB  - Conserving diversity below the species level is vital to maintaining species' adaptive potential. However, defining intra-specific units for conservation is complex due to the often-continuous nature of differentiation, and thus multiple lines of evidence are needed to adequately capture adaptive differences. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) exemplify this challenge, exhibiting diverse behavioural, genetic, and morphological variation throughout their range, with several populations facing extirpation. We used a long-term telemetry dataset of 302 caribou across the species' range in western Canada to assess individual variation in movement behaviours. This included behaviours hypothesized to be of adaptive significance, such as migration, home range size and shape, and inferred predator avoidance tactics. Gaussian finite mixture models were then used to identify intra-specific behavioural clusters which may be evolutionarily significant, followed by Random Forest models to discern behaviours driving differentiation between clusters. We identified six distinct clusters based on individual variation in behaviour. Differentiation between clusters was significantly influenced by selection for canopy cover (%) at calving events, home range size and shape, migratory behaviour, and geographic location. Since behavioural variation arises from genetic, environmental, and social factors, our results highlight the value of incorporating trait variation into the assessment of evolutionarily significant units for conservation. We advocate for the consideration of behavioural variation, as it offers valuable insights into adaptive differences. This approach holds promise for informing conservation efforts, not only for caribou, but other terrestrial species at risk given the importance of maintaining genetic and phenotypic diversity.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objectives
Dementia often limits the agency of the person to such an extent that there is need for external support in making daily life decisions. This support is usually provided by family members who are sometimes legally empowered to engage in decision-making on behalf of the person for whom they care. However, such family carers receive little or no information on how to best provide support when there is a lack of capacity. This may have an impact on the agency of the person with dementia. This review explores the experience of agency in people living with dementia.
Design
A systematic search was conducted on IBSS, MedLine, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Two independent researchers screened the studies and conducted the quality appraisal. We used meta-ethnography for data analysis. As part of the synthesis, we identified behavioral mechanisms underlying the process of decision-making and looked at how the support of carers comes into play in making deliberate choices.
Results
The meta-ethnography involved 20 studies. Three levels of third-order constructs were identified, each describing a decision-making pathway and reflecting the degree of autonomy of the person with dementia: autonomous decision-making, shared decision-making, and pseudo decision-making. Findings highlight those inter-relational processes that promote or negatively impact on the agency of people with dementia.
Conclusions
Our review will provide health and social care personnel with an understanding of the role of the carer in the decision-making process, and therefore which mechanisms need to be promoted or discouraged through training.

AB  - With the trend of global warming and destructive human activities, the frequent occurrences of catastrophes have posed devastating threats to human life and social stability worldwide. The emergency management (EM) system plays a significant role in saving people's lives and reducing property damage. The prediction system for the occurrence of emergency events and resulting impacts is widely recognized as the first stage of the EM system, the accuracy of which has a significant impact on the efficiency of resource allocation, dispatching, and evacuation. In fact, the number and variety of contributions to prediction techniques, such as statistic analysis, artificial intelligence, and simulation method, are exploded in recent years, motivating the need for a systematic analysis of the current works on disaster prediction. To this end, this paper presents a systematic review of contributions on prediction methods for emergency occurrence and resource demand of both natural and man-made disasters. Through a detailed discussion on the features of each type of emergency event, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art prediction technologies which have been widely applied in EM. After that, we summarize the challenges of current efforts and point out future directions.

AB  - Modular construction offers a sustainable alternative to traditional construction by reducing waste, lowering carbon emissions, and enhancing flexibility through the relocation, renovation, and repurposing of modules. Aligning with circular economy principles, adaptive reuse of modular buildings emerges as an effective strategy to minimize resource and energy demands associated with producing raw materials and new modules. However, quantifying the environmental impacts of reused modules presents significant challenges due to the complex reconfiguration of modules into different building systems and the limitations of existing life cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel three-step framework that integrates LCA, Production Environmental Footprint method with a module-based impact distribution formula. In this framework, each module is allocated primary production and disposal impacts for its first and last use cycle, along with environmental credit and load for subsequent cycles. The framework was tested through a use case involving a relocatable modular school building (L1) in South Korea, which was partially reconfigured into a new building (L2). After applying the proposed framework, the net carbon emissions assigned to L1's life cycle were offset by 30.55 %. The framework also demonstrated its effectiveness in quantifying and allocating impacts of reused modules in four scenarios of L2 building, thereby enabling a more nuanced assessment of adaptive reuse strategies. This innovative framework not only facilitates improved environmental impact assessments of the adaptive reuse of modular buildings but also supports the construction industry's transition towards greater circularity and sustainability.

KW  - Emergent behavior
KW  - Verification and validation
KW  - Systematic mapping study
AB  - Context:
Emergent behavior cannot be attributed to one individual system alone but arises in the interplay of various systems, components etc. Ensuring the correctness of emergent behavior is a well-known challenge that has been addressed by research in various subfields of software engineering.
Objective:
This paper aims at providing a unified view on the research activities conducted and research contributions made on verification and validation of emergent behavior.
Methods:
We have conducted a systematic mapping study on the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. We applied a combined search strategy using manual, database, and snowball search. In total we investigated 7211 papers, from these 168 relevant papers have been included and classified.
Results:
Results show an increasing interest in the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. As only little validation and evaluation research has been conducted, the field can be considered still immature. There exist different verification and validation techniques used in the various solution approaches such as model checking, simulation, or runtime monitoring. It stands out that even though research is published in different software engineering fields and subfields no verification or validation technique can be attributed solely to a single field.

AB  - Power generation from grid-connected residential photovoltaic (PV) systems has been widely recognized worldwide as an integral component in the energy transition. However, concerns remain about whether its costs and benefits have been fairly distributed in our society. This systematic review was conducted using 87 articles to explore inequalities in the adoption of rooftop PV systems in the world and its distributive impacts. There is strong evidence that adoption occurs predominantly among affluent households, and although some studies show a reduction in concentration over time, adoption remains uneven in most places. Furthermore, the incentive policies for rooftop PV have regressive characteristics, as they especially benefit the wealthiest, while their costs disproportionately affect the most vulnerable households. To address this situation, the literature recommends targeting subsidies to lower-income households, encouraging community solar facilities, and better publicizing the characteristics of the incentive programs, especially in vulnerable communities. In addition, using more cost-reflective electricity tariffs and replacing the feed-in tariff mechanism with market-oriented policies can help reduce inequalities. Finally, the article outlines future research agendas to expand upon the insights gained from this study.

AB  - Background
An increasing number of users are turning to web-based sources as an important source of health care guidance information. Thus, trustworthy sources of information should be automatically identifiable using objective criteria.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to automate the assessment of the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) criteria, enhancing our ability to pinpoint trustworthy health information sources.
Methods
A data set of 538 web pages displaying health content was collected from 43 health-related websites. HONcode criteria have been considered as web page and website levels. For the website-level criteria (confidentiality, transparency, financial disclosure, and advertising policy), a bag of keywords has been identified to assess the criteria using a rule-based model. For the web page–level criteria (authority, complementarity, justifiability, and attribution) several machine learning (ML) approaches were used. In total, 200 web pages were manually annotated until achieving a balanced representation in terms of frequency. In total, 3 ML models—random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)—were trained on the initial annotated data. A second step of training was implemented for the complementarity criterion using the BERT model for multiclass classification of the complementarity sentences obtained by annotation and data augmentation (positive, negative, and noncommittal sentences). Finally, the remaining web pages were classified using the selected model and 100 sentences were randomly selected for manual review.
Results
For web page–level criteria, the random forest model showed a good performance for the attribution criterion while displaying subpar performance in the others. BERT and SVM had a stable performance across all the criteria. BERT had a better area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00 for neutral sentences, justifiability, and attribution, respectively. SVM had the overall better performance for the classification of complementarity with the AUC equal to 0.98. Finally, SVM and BERT had an equal AUC of 0.98 for the authority criterion. For the website level criteria, the rule-based model was able to retrieve web pages with an accuracy of 0.97 for confidentiality, 0.82 for transparency, and 0.51 for both financial disclosure and advertising policy. The final evaluation of the sentences determined 0.88 of precision and the agreement level of reviewers was computed at 0.82.
Conclusions
Our results showed the potential power of automating the HONcode criteria assessment using ML approaches. This approach could be used with different types of pretrained models to accelerate the text annotation, and classification and to improve the performance in low-resource cases. Further work needs to be conducted to determine how to assign different weights to the criteria, as well as to identify additional characteristics that should be considered for consolidating these criteria into a comprehensive reliability score.

AB  - Background
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are being exposed to large amounts of information each day. This “infodemic” is defined by the World Health Organization as the mass spread of misleading or false information during a pandemic. This spread of misinformation during the infodemic ultimately leads to misunderstandings of public health orders or direct opposition against public policies. Although there have been efforts to combat misinformation spread, current manual fact-checking methods are insufficient to combat the infodemic.
Objective
We propose the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to build a model that can be used to identify unreliable news articles online.
Methods
First, we preprocessed the ReCOVery data set to obtain 2029 English news articles tagged with COVID-19 keywords from January to May 2020, which are labeled as reliable or unreliable. Data exploration was conducted to determine major differences between reliable and unreliable articles. We built an ensemble deep learning model using the body text, as well as features, such as sentiment, Empath-derived lexical categories, and readability, to classify the reliability.
Results
We found that reliable news articles have a higher proportion of neutral sentiment, while unreliable articles have a higher proportion of negative sentiment. Additionally, our analysis demonstrated that reliable articles are easier to read than unreliable articles, in addition to having different lexical categories and keywords. Our new model was evaluated to achieve the following performance metrics: 0.906 area under the curve (AUC), 0.835 specificity, and 0.945 sensitivity. These values are above the baseline performance of the original ReCOVery model.
Conclusions
This paper identified novel differences between reliable and unreliable news articles; moreover, the model was trained using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. We aim to be able to use our findings to help researchers and the public audience more easily identify false information and unreliable media in their everyday lives.

AB  - In sequence to sequence generation tasks (e.g. machine translation and abstractive summarization), inference is generally performed in a left-to-right manner to produce the result token by token. The neural approaches, such as LSTM and self-attention networks, are now able to make full use of all the predicted history hypotheses from left side during inference, but cannot meanwhile access any future (right side) information and usually generate unbalanced outputs (e.g. left parts are much more accurate than right ones in Chinese-English translation). In this work, we propose a synchronous bidirectional inference model to generate outputs using both left-to-right and right-to-left decoding simultaneously and interactively. First, we introduce a novel beam search algorithm that facilitates synchronous bidirectional decoding. Then, we present the core approach which enables left-to-right and right-to-left decoding to interact with each other, so as to utilize both the history and future predictions simultaneously during inference. We apply the proposed model to both LSTM and self-attention networks. Furthermore, we propose a novel fine-tuning based parameter optimization algorithm in addition to the simple two-pass strategy. The extensive experiments on machine translation and abstractive summarization demonstrate that our synchronous bidirectional inference model can achieve remarkable improvements over the strong baselines.

AB  - Rural tourism has been widely recognized as a means of promoting the revival of traditional villages and has been supported by numerous researchers. It has the potential to provide significant social and economic advantages, making it a popular strategy for rural development in both developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, a growing body of research has substantiated the significant disruptions that rural tourism has imposed on traditional villages. This study employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) qualitative method to systematically analyze 92 papers from WOS and SCOPUS that investigate the impact of rural tourism on traditional villages. The papers were categorized into five groups: spatial, economic, sociocultural, and holistic. This categorization allowed for the identification of the purpose, theme, sub-topics, research methods, and data sources used in these papers, which in turn provided an overview of the characteristics and overall trends in research in this field. It compensates for the deficiencies of lesser reviews that just emphasize rural tourism as the primary catalyst for the sustainable development of traditional villages. Based on a thorough investigation, this paper asserts that the development of tourism in traditional villages should be differentiated from typical rural tourism sites that prioritize the preferences of tourists. The primary objective should be to prioritize the preservation of community values, with a strong emphasis on community participation. This should be done while considering the interests of various stakeholders and promoting a diverse range of livelihoods that are rooted in traditional practices. By doing so, the essence of authenticity in traditional villages can be reinforced, leading to a greater sense of connection and loyalty among tourists. The preservation of traditional village genes fosters a symbiotic relationship with rural tourism, resulting in a mutually beneficial cycle.

AB  - Sunken brain syndrome (SBS) is a severe but preventable complication of decompressive craniectomy (DC), characterized by paradoxical herniation, cortical compression, and neurological decline. Despite rising incidence, early-onset SBS (≤ 3 months post-DC) remains poorly understood. This study integrates a case-informed review and literature-based analysis to explore possible contributors to SBS development. Motivated by a clinical observation of a 50-year-old woman with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), who developed SBS seven weeks post-DC, we reviewed 65 early-onset SBS cases to identify risk patterns. Her clinical course raised concerns about underrecognized risk factors and limited preventive strategies incorporating vigilant postoperative monitoring. Patients were categorized by clinical and pathophysiological characteristics. Cardiovascular (42%) and neurological (38%) comorbidities were most common. Those with intracranial hemodynamic or hydrodynamic instability, particularly sustained hypoperfusion or prolonged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbance, developed SBS more rapidly. We used a weighted risk-scoring model to classify patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. Cumulative incidence analysis showed that high-risk patients developed SBS earlier (median: 30 days, interquartile range: 21–55) than low-risk ones (median: 89 days, interquartile range: 60–89), suggesting a link between risk burden and SBS acceleration. Cranioplasty within 90 days post-DC demonstrated better functional outcomes than delayed or no cranioplasty. Conservative measures were also effective when applied rapidly, underlining the value of multimodal neuromonitoring in catching early symptoms. While this study offers a hypothesis-generating framework for future research to develop structured models for early-onset SBS prevention, its exploratory nature and small sample size make larger cohorts necessary for validation.

Despite its popularity, the challenge of effectively initializing and optimizing RNN-LSTM models persists, often hindering their performance and accuracy. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) using an in-depth four-step approach based on the PRISMA methodology, incorporating peer-reviewed articles spanning 2018–2023. It aims to address how weight initialization and optimization techniques can bolster RNN-LSTM performance. This SLR offers a detailed overview across various applications and domains, and stands out by comprehensively analyzing modeling techniques, datasets, evaluation metrics, and programming languages associated with these networks. The findings of this SLR provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to enhance RNN-LSTM networks and achieve superior results.

AB  - Camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are effective tools for as-built building surveys. Through a systematic literature review, we synthesized and categorized factors affecting the quality of UAV-based reconstructed scenes and their associated performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy and time efficiency). Their interrelationships were analyzed by Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify critical factors and their impacts. We further quantitatively evaluated these factors and metrics through controlled experiments with a camera-equipped UAV and a Terrestrial Laser Scanner for an institutional building. Various flight paths, photo overlaps, and distances to the building were tested to evaluate their impact on dimensional accuracy, time efficiency, and point cloud density. We demonstrated the trade-offs between the influential factors to provide insights into parameter selection. Additionally, a data requirements schema for UAV-based as-built 3D scene reconstruction was established toward standardization of data processing practices. This study could serve as a foundation for future research and applications of UAV-based photogrammetry for building surveys.

AB  - Our agri-food system today should provide enough healthy food of good quality for the growing human population. However, it should also preserve natural resources and better protect livestock. In this context, some FoodTech companies are developing a disruptive approach: cell culture for in vitro food production of “meat” but this technology is still at the research and development stage. This article will highlight its development, the technologies used and the stakeholders involved (Part 1), its potential environmental impacts (Part 2) but also regulatory, social and ethical issues (Part 3). This article aims to shed light throughout the manuscript on two major controversies related to “cultured meat”. The first controversy is related to its ethical aspects, which includes different points: its potential to reduce animal suffering and therefore to improve animal welfare, the future values of our society, and a trend towards food artificialisation. The second controversy includes environmental, health and nutritional issues, in relation to the characteristics and quality of “cultured meat” with an important question: should we call it meat? These two controversies act in interaction in association with related societal, legal and consequently political issues. Answers to the various questions depend on the different visions of the World by stakeholders, consumers and citizens. Some of them argue for a moderate or a strong reduction in livestock farming, or even the abolition of livestock farming perceived as an exploitation of farm animals. Others just want a reduction of the current much criticised intensive/industrial model. Compared with other potential sustainable solutions to be implemented such as reduction of food losses and waste, new food consumption habits with less proteins of animal sources, sustainable intensification, development of agroecological livestock production, or the development of the market for other meat substitutes (proteins from plants, mycoproteins, algae, insects, etc.), “cultured meat” has an uncertain future.

AB  - The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) has heavily relied on ex post, reactive tools. This approach has proven inadequate, as numerous foreseeable problems arising out of commercial development and applications of AI have harmed vulnerable persons and communities, with few (and sometimes no) opportunities for recourse. Worse problems are highly likely in the future. By requiring quality control measures before AI is deployed, an ex ante approach would often mitigate and sometimes entirely prevent injuries that AI causes or contributes to. Licensing is an important tool of ex ante regulation, and should be applied in many high-risk domains of AI. Indeed, policymakers and even some leading AI developers and vendors are calling for licensure in the area. To substantiate licensing proposals, this article specifies optimal terms of licensure for AI necessary to justify its use. Given both documented and potential harms arising out of high-risk AI systems, licensing agencies should require firms to demonstrate that their AI meets clear requirements for security, non-discrimination, accuracy, appropriateness, and correctability before being deployed. Under this ex ante model of regulation, AI developers would bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their technology is not discriminatory, not manipulative, not unfair, not inaccurate, and not illegitimate in its lawful bases and purposes. While the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can provide key benchmarks here for ex post regulation, the proposed AI Act (AIA) offers a first regulatory attempt towards an ex ante licensure regime in high-risk areas, but it should be strengthened through an expansion of its scope and substantive content and through greater transparency of the ex ante justification process.

AB  - Summary
Research publications are the major repository of scientific knowledge. However, their unstructured and highly heterogenous format creates a significant obstacle to large-scale analysis of the information contained within. Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has provided a variety of tools for high-quality information extraction from unstructured text. These tools are primarily trained on non-technical text and struggle to produce accurate results when applied to scientific text, involving specific technical terminology. During the last years, significant efforts in information retrieval have been made for biomedical and biochemical publications.

AB  - The eyes are the windows of the soul, providing essential information through eye movement. With the rapid development of eye-tracking technology (ETT), its application in health assessment, including diagnosing and treating neurological diseases, has expanded significantly. Stroke is a leading cause of adult death and disability worldwide, and studies have shown that eye movement information can serve as a quantitative indicator for stroke diagnosis and assessment. Despite significant research on ETT-based stroke diagnosis, a comprehensive review is still lacking. This paper reviews 238 papers from the past twenty years, focusing on recent advancements in ETT and its application in stroke diagnosis. The studies were selected through a systematic review process following PRISMA-ScR guidelines. This paper provides a systematic overview of ETT principles, methods, and systems, detailing the entire application process in stroke diagnosis and assessment, from data acquisition to symptom evaluation. It also compares various methods and discusses the latest advancements. Statistical analysis methods remain the majority in ETT-based stroke research, while machine learning methods are increasingly attracting attention as alternative approaches. Appearance-based deep learning methods show potential for future stroke diagnosis but require accuracy improvements. Future directions in stroke diagnosis and clinical applications mainly include synthetic data generation, VR integration, wearable ETT devices, multimodal data fusion, and expanding application scenarios. Finally, we propose an active perception strategy and a stroke medical system framework for ETT application. This paper aims to provide researchers with a rapid understanding of core technologies and comprehensive knowledge.

AB  - This review critically evaluates membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for greywater treatment, focusing on greywater characterization, MBR configurations, treatment processes, and reuse applications. MBR systems achieve high treatment efficiencies, with COD and TSS removal rates often exceeding 90% and 95%, respectively. The distinct characteristics of light and dark greywater, stemming from their varying pollutant loads, significantly influence MBR performance and must be considered during system design and operation. Most studies have been conducted at laboratory and pilot scales, with submerged and flat sheet membranes being the most commonly employed configurations. However, approximately 60% of the studies did not specify the membrane material, and 18% utilized PVDF membranes. Treatment-focused studies dominate the literature, while cost analyses and life cycle assessments (LCA) remain limited, revealing a significant gap in economic and environmental evaluations. Comparative analyses demonstrate that MBR systems outperform conventional methods, such as constructed wetlands and filtration, in terms of effluent quality and spatial efficiency. Pre-treatment processes, including sedimentation and fine filtration, are effective in mitigating membrane fouling, while post-treatment methods, such as UV disinfection and chlorination, ensure effluent suitability for reuse. Recent advancements, including gravity-driven MBRs, offer promising solutions for reducing energy consumption, making MBRs more suitable for decentralized applications. Reuse of treated greywater for irrigation, toilet flushing, and cleaning provides a sustainable approach to alleviate freshwater demand. However, further research is required to address operational challenges, optimize system performance, and develop regulatory frameworks that support the widespread implementation of greywater reuse with MBR technology.

KW  - Transport mode selection
AB  - Purpose
Transport is the European Union (EU) sector that produces the second highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In its attempts to promote the environmentally sustainable development of transport, the EU has focussed on intermodal transport in particular – but with limited success. It is important to understand how freight transport is selected, which criteria are used and what role environmental sustainability and intermodal transport play in the selection. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the role of environmental sustainability and intermodal transport in transport mode decisions. The authors look at this issue from the perspective of logistics service providers (LSPs) and buyers, as they are important stakeholders in guiding this process.
Design/methodology/approach
To gain a holistic view of the current state of research, the authors have conducted a systematic literature review of the role of environmental sustainability and intermodal transport in transport mode decisions. The authors have further examined the findings concerning requests for quotations (RfQs), tenders and transport contracts, as these are also linked to decisions on transport choice.
Findings
The findings from the literature review include the results of descriptive and structured content analysis of the selected articles. They show that the discussion on environmental sustainability and intermodal transport as a sustainable mode, together with the transport mode selection criteria, RfQs/tenders and transport contracts, is still a rather new and emerging topic in the literature. The main focus related to the selection of transport mode has been on utility and cost efficiency, and only recently have issues such as environmental sustainability and intermodal transport started to gain greater attention. The findings also indicate that the theoretical lenses most typically used have been preference models and total cost theories, although the theoretical base has recently become more diversified.
Research limitations/implications
There is still a need to extend the theoretical and methodological base, which could then lead to innovative theory building and testing. Such diverse application of methodologies will help in understanding how environmental sustainability can be better linked to mode choice decisions.
Practical implications
The findings will be of interest to policy makers and companies opting for environmentally sustainable transport solutions.
Social implications
If the EU, shippers and LSPs take a more active stance in promoting environmentally sustainable transformation models, this will have long-lasting societal impacts.
Originality/value
It seems that this systematic literature review of the topic is one of the first such attempts in the current body of literature.

AB  - Abstract:
Despite the clinical success of redirected T cells in the setting of cancer adoptive cell immunotherapy, patients may exhibit resistance to treatment, resulting in uncontrolled disease and relapses. This phenomenon partly relies on impaired ex vivo-produced T cell metabolic fitness, including a decreased respiratory reserve as well as a greater sensitivity to tumour-mediated metabolic stress. To improve the respiratory capacity of cultured T cells, we sought to target the NAD/SIRT-1/ROS axis through supplementation of culture medium with resveratrol. Resveratrol-treated T cells display broader respiratory capacities, along with sustained ROS control ability. Strikingly, we reveal that the effect of resveratrol on T cells is restricted to cytomegalovirus-exposed donors, a virus known to promote immune ageing. Herein, cytomegalovirus prior infection is associated with the influence of terminally differentiated T cell on the fate of companion T cell subsets. Moreover, beyond resveratrol’s effect on redirected T cell metabolic features, it provides a functional anti-tumour advantage to these CMV seropositive donor-derived T cells, in a third generation CD123-specific CAR-T cell in vitro model. This highlights the necessity to consider patient’s intrinsic attributes, especially immune ageing-related ones, when assessing new T cell production process to improve clinical efficacy, pushing of personalized medicine limits.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive scenario analysis for a Renewable Energy Community (REC) located in a mountain area, with the aim to emphasize the interplay between building envelope performance, heating system technologies, and the penetration of PV systems. Motivated by the urgent need to transition towards sustainable energy systems, the study explores and validates the efficacy of a co-simulation infrastructure in assessing the performance of RECs by means of grid and building-level KPIs. The methodology integrates an advanced co-simulation tool to model and assess the impacts of various REC scenarios on the energy shared by the community, effectively capturing the patterns of energy production and consumption. The tool leverages a heterogeneous but limited set of input data to obtain a realistic representation of the specific REC. The major findings reveal significant insights into how the synergy between building envelope design, heating system options, and PV system penetration can enhance RECs’ sustainability and energy efficiency. Conclusions drawn from the study underscore the crucial role of advanced simulation approaches in guiding decision-making processes for the development and optimization of RECs, thanks to the deeper understanding of the complex factors that drive community performance.

AB  - This study presents an overview of the evolving relationship between technology and global politics, focusing on global techno-politics (GTP). Technology was seen as neutral and accessible, with market forces and multilateral states enforcing global trading norms. However, recent years have witnessed a shift as technological powers turn interdependencies into vulnerabilities. The intense technological competition between China and the U.S. has exposed the non-neutrality of technology, resulting in geopolitical tensions and strategic market exclusions. The impact of technology on global politics extends beyond a single sector, affecting policies, laws, governance, security, international relations, economics, and human rights. This intersection of technology and global politics forms the basis of GTP, where political decisions and actions are influenced by technological advancements, and vice versa. Understanding the landscape of GTP is therefore crucial for individuals, organizations, and states to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the digital age while ensuring technology serves the public interest. The present study seeks to deepen our understanding of GTP and its implications by reviewing the extant IS research and providing opportunities for future research.

AB  - Composite materials allow the production of structures with desired and improved properties (such as high strength), while minimizing the undesirable outcomes (e.g., increased weight). This ability to tune the properties of materials and structures has put composite materials under the spotlight in many fields, ranging from medical, automotive, aerospace, marine, and civil engineering applications. With the wide range of uses composite materials find their place in, it is important for engineers and researchers to have a good understanding of the behaviors of composite materials, such as bending, buckling, or vibration. As such, in recent years, investigating the dynamical behavior of such structures has been a popular topic of study, as signified by the copious amounts of studies focusing on the linear/nonlinear free vibrational response of these composite/nanocomposite systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the available research on nonlinear and linear free vibrations of composite/nanocomposite shell-type structures. The research conducted employs a wide variety of different conditions, geometries, methods/models, and materials. As such, a vast number of unique studies exist, focusing on linear and nonlinear free vibrations of composite/nanocomposite shell-type systems. The goal of this review article is to provide an in-depth summary of the available literature on nonlinear and linear free vibrations of composite/nanocomposite shell-type structures, to elaborate on the methods and approaches used by researchers, to present the findings obtained by researchers regarding this topic so far, and to point out the gap of research with the intention to propel future works of research.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to determine whether Systems of Artificial Intelligence (SAI) can be deemed subjects of law. This aim is formulated according to the technical capabilities integrated in SAI and the SAI's ability to interact independently with other legal subjects. SAI features, such as direct connection with intellectual skills, the ability to understand, learn and make autonomous decisions may cause situations where autonomous systems based on AI will make decisions which will be in the best interests of individuals, even though conflicting with the user's own will. To consider the possibility of SAI being recognized as possessing legal personality, we analyse the concept and features of SAI and define its operating principles. We give hypothetical examples to demonstrate the necessity of SAIs being recognized as such. The paper undertakes legal personality analysis of SAI performed: (i) using the philosophical and legal concepts of a subject (person); (ii) discussing artificial (unnatural subjects of law) as an alternative to the recognition of legal personality of SAI; (iii) using elements of legal personality set for natural and legal persons. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the scope of SAI rights and obligations will not necessarily be the same as the scope of rights and obligations of other subjects of law. Thus, SAI could only have rights and obligations that are strictly defined by legislators. This conclusion suggests that the result of this paper may be its use in further research defining the scope of SAI rights and obligations.

AB  - Human Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims to automatically evaluate the performance of actions executed by humans, is an emerging field of human action analysis. Although many review articles have been conducted for human action analysis fields such as action recognition and action prediction, there is a lack of up-to-date and systematic reviews related to AQA. This paper aims to provide a systematic literature review of existing papers on vision-based human AQA. This systematic review was rigorously conducted following the PRISMA guideline through the databases of Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science in July 2024. Ninety-six research articles were selected for the final analysis after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review presents an overview of various aspects of AQA, including existing applications, data acquisition methods, public datasets, state-of-the-art methods and evaluation metrics. We observe an increase in the number of studies in AQA since 2019, primarily due to the advent of deep learning methods and motion capture devices. We categorize these AQA methods into skeleton-based and video-based methods based on the data modality used. There are different evaluation metrics for various AQA tasks. SRC is the most commonly used evaluation metric, with fifty-six out of ninety-six selected papers using it to evaluate their models. Sports event scoring, surgical skill evaluation and rehabilitation assessment are the most popular three scenarios in this direction based on existing papers and there are more new scenarios being explored such as piano skill assessment. Furthermore, the existing challenges and future research directions are provided, which can be a helpful guide for researchers to explore AQA.

AB  - This work presents an optimization framework for the simultaneous design of low-carbon hydrogen and carbon dioxide capture, use, and storage supply chains. The proposed model is a large-scale multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming that maximizes the net present value. Our approach addresses technological hydrogen production and carbon capture pathways, multimodal transportation of materials, electricity generation and transmission, and carbon dioxide utilization via enhanced oil recovery. The novelty of this work is twofold: the design of a low-carbon hydrogen supply chain and its integration into an oil field development of infrastructure designed to produce incremental crude oil via carbon dioxide injection; thus, it can be captured, utilized, and stored. We consider crude oil production profiles, characteristics of oil reservoirs, and well drilling constraints to represent the CO2-EOR operation. We conduct a nationwide long-term planning case study considering the potential for enhanced oil recovery operations and the availability of biomass, solar, and wind resources in Colombia to produce low-carbon hydrogen and monetize carbon dioxide through incremental crude oil production. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI) was designed to guide the end user in setting up case studies and analyzing the results through a series of tabular structures.

AB  - A coalition as a group of agents aims to work jointly to earn much more gains as a result of their cooperation. Many existing studies assumed that members take advantage of joining one coalition at a time, albeit the importance of coalition formation problems. Therefore, more attention to overlapping coalitions needs to be paid to optimise resource management by forming in multiple overlapping coalitions simultaneously. Roughly speaking, the related literature includes two main streams; (i) theoretical foundations of coalition formation games and, (ii) the coalition structure generation problems. This paper first provides a review of coalition structure generation at large to develop a taxonomic framework and classify the existing literature, viz., macro analysis. The paper then reviews studies on overlapping coalitions thoroughly, viz., micro analysis. The micro analysis presents and discusses different models of overlapping coalition games and related solution concepts as well as surveying all problem-solving approaches for overlapping coalition structure generation. Finally, the outstanding challenges and opportunities for future research considerations are discussed and shared.

The research indicators proved that the interest in MGs is growing in numerous countries whose concern is to seek alternative energy generation with renewable energy sources (RES) to supply an increasing demand for energy production and reduce the impacts of atmospheric pollutants. Moreover, the insertion of blockchain technology in the energy market can provide significant advances in the commercialization of electric energy, enabling virtual transactions to be conducted in a decentralized and secure way, managing numerous smart contracts, and contributing reasonably to introducing prosumers in energy transactions in MGs. This systematic review enabled us to shed more light and direct the study methodology to answer the questions surrounding this research. The aspects found explore concepts similar to the characteristics of TE and MGs exposed in the review of indicators. It was possible to perceive that the research strategy was successfully employed and has considerable academic significance, especially in this theme. Additionally, a new approach to the topic was presented by analyzing the interactions of prosumers and utility. The sustainable aspect related to MGs communities is highlighted because of the self-supply of smart homes and the use of RES.

AB  - Over the past decade, the use of 3D scanning, virtual reconstruction and digital manufacturing in the preservation of cultural heritage (CH) has gained significant attention, among other for the restorative intervention of loss compensation. These techniques have been explored both in conservation-restoration (CR) practices and research facilities. However, despite this progress, there is a notable absence of an educational framework specifically designed for virtual restoration methods aimed at physical restoration. As a result, CR practitioners motivated to execute a virtual restoration are either challenged to find their way in a wealth of information or have to rely on 3D experts for guidance and digital tasks. This article discusses this gap by detailing the construction and validation of an educational framework for loss compensation on CH objects. Drawing upon an extensive review of past case studies, an “Overview of possibilities on the application of 3D technologies for restoration of CH objects” (shortened to Overview OP) is compiled of involved reasons, processes, methods and materials to consider within a virtual restoration workflow. The composed Overview consists of eight phases, distinguishing 22 steps, encompassing both traditional restorations steps, virtual steps and combined steps in which material, object, device and product-related possibilities are displayed. To assess its effectiveness, an experimental set-up was devised, incorporating a pre and post-test, short-term and long-term usability testing, and an evaluation questionnaire. This set-up was implemented within an educational context involving third-year bachelor students in CR at the University of Antwerp (n = 17). Although the Overview OP does require a learning curve and may initially appear overwhelming, the experimental results demonstrated it organisational structure. It was found to be highly useful, time-saving and capable of efficiently guiding CR practitioners towards relevant information tailored to their specific cases. Following the validation process, the Overview OP was improved based on the received feedback. Additionally, a literature update was conducted, expanding the Overview OP to include cases executed between 2020 and 2023. The finalised version, along with the accompanying “Inventory of cases” is now accessible open-source on an online platform.

AB  - The explosive growth of biomedical literature has created a rich source of knowledge, such as that on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), locked in unstructured free text. Biomedical relation classification aims to automatically detect and classify biomedical relations, which has great benefits for various biomedical research and applications. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in biomedical relation classification. With the advance of neural network methodology, neural network-based approaches have been applied in biomedical relation classification and achieved state-of-the-art performance for some public datasets and shared tasks. In this review, we describe the recent advancement of neural network-based approaches for classifying biomedical relations. We summarize the available corpora and introduce evaluation metrics. We present the general framework for neural network-based approaches in biomedical relation extraction and pretrained word embedding resources. We discuss neural network-based approaches, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We conclude by describing the remaining challenges and outlining future directions.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications vary widely including data monitoring, data collection and analysis, intelligent navigation and object tracking, surveillance and emergency response, vehicular and intelligent transport, and agricultural, marine, and photogrammetry. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based UAV-assisted IoT networks enable resource-constrained mobile or IoT devices to offload computationally demanding tasks to UAVs or edge nodes with more computing power in order to improve battery consumption, performance, or Quality of Service. UAV-assisted IoT applications generally require a lot of precision for efficient UAV control involving UAV movement and position optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been identified as one of the most prominent techniques for facilitating this and optimizing of the terrestrial network performance, thus improving the operation of these applications. This paper aims to answer twelve important research questions relating to the research on DRL for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based UAV-assisted sensor and IoT applications from 47 systematically selected articles. The questions cover a variety of topics including the UAV-assisted MEC IoT applications studied, variants of deployed DRL, the purpose of DRL, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) components, unique network architectural features, environments and integrated technologies, role of UAVs, optimization constraints, joint optimization frameworks, energy-management techniques, metrics examined, benchmark algorithms and performance results as well as identified probable future considerations based on the review. Lastly, the challenges and future directions of DRL application in UAV-assisted MEC systems are discussed. This paper aims to provide both communication generalists and optimization specialists with a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape in this field.

AB  - Summary:
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are integral to infant health. Yet, their complex biosynthesis pathways in the mammary gland during lactation remain under-characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we performed integrated analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets combined with select HMO concentration measures. We identify differential expression patterns of known HMO synthesis genes in epithelial subsets and nominate several candidate genes that vary with HMO concentration. Additionally, we identify novel gene patterns and transcription factors that may regulate the expression of HMO biosynthesis genes and the cellular pathways supporting HMO production. Finally, we demonstrate that co-expression of HMO synthesis genes and milk fat synthesis genes is limited, suggesting that distinct epithelial cell subtypes may be responsible for the production of different milk components. Our study suggests that HMO synthesis may be achieved through cell-type specialization within the lactocyte compartment.

AB  - In our current day and age, Earth suffers under the human ecological footprint, which influences our health and well-being. Technological solutions, including software-related ones, may help tackle these concerns for humanity. However, the development of such solutions requires special attention and effort to overcome human, public, and social barriers that might prevent them from being effective. The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH’21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology.

AB  - The variety of enormous information on the web encourages the field of recommender systems (RS) to flourish. In recent times, deep learning techniques have significantly impacted information retrieval tasks, including RS. The probabilistic and non-linear views of neural networks emerge to generative models for recommendation tasks. At present, there is an absence of extensive survey on deep generative models for RS. Therefore, this article aims at providing a coherent and comprehensive survey on recent efforts on deep generative models for RS. In particular, we provide an in-depth research effort in devising the taxonomy of deep generative models for RS, along with the summary of state-of-art methods. Lastly, we highlight the potential future prospects based on recent trends and new research avenues in this interesting and developing field.

AB  - Smart contracts are coded parameters written into an immutable distributed ledger called a blockchain. There has been increasing legal interest in the application of these self-executing programs to conduct transactions. Most of the scholarly and practical analysis so far has been taken the claims of this technology being akin to a contract at face value, with legal analysis of contract formation, performance, and enforcement at the forefront of the debate. This article discusses that while smart contracts may pose some interesting legal questions, most of these are irrelevant, and smart contracts should be understood almost strictly from a technical perspective, and that any legal response is entirely dependent on the technical capabilities of the smart contract. The article proposes that smart contracts are not contracts for all practical purposes.

AB  - Competition between companies, especially in the metalworking industry, has driven the continuous search for strategies that aim to reduce costs, improve product quality, and shorten delivery times. However, a persistent challenge that these industries face is delivery delays, caused by a number of complex factors, including supply chain issues, project management difficulties, technical and work issues. To address this issue, several approaches and methodologies have been adopted. On the one hand, agile management tools such as Scrum, Prince2 Agile, Lean Project Management, Agile Project Management and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) have been implemented to increase the flexibility and adaptability of production processes. On the other hand, classic analytical solutions, such as the Gantt/Waterfall Method, PMBOK Guide, Spiral Model, Prince2 and the Critical Path Method (CPM) and/or the PERT method, have been applied to ensure a clearer and more structured view of projects. In addition to these traditional approaches, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in project management. A detailed analysis of articles reveals a marked preference for Machine Learning (ML), with particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These AI techniques have been successfully applied in a variety of projects, especially in civil construction, helping to predict and mitigate delays, improve operational efficiency and optimize resource allocation. Despite the progress made, research on the use of AI in project management still faces significant challenges, as reflected in the scarcity of available studies on the topic in project management in the metalworking industry.

There are many subcategories, especially for Materialism Theories. Each explanation is self-described by its adherents, critique is minimal and only for clarification, and there is no attempt to adjudicate among theories. The implications of consciousness explanations or theories are assessed with respect to four questions: meaning/purpose/value (if any); AI consciousness; virtual immortality; and survival beyond death. A Landscape of Consciousness, I suggest, offers perspective.

AB  - The dual inhibition of SIK2/3 has been considered as a potential treatment approach for MEF2C-high acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although diverse scaffolds of pan-SIK or SIK2/3 inhibitors have been reported, few of them showed sufficient in vitro or in vivo antitumor activity. Based on the proposed binding mode of the hit molecule (7), chemical space in the solvent/P-loop region was explored via fragment growing/replacement, supported by the generative chemistry platform. Further SAR exploration and ADME optimization led to the discovery of 7s, which exhibited excellent potency and strong selectivity in MEF2C high-expression cell lines over MEF2C-low cell lines. Moreover, oral administration of 7s was found to demonstrate significant tumor growth inhibition in a MV4-11 AML mice CDX model without any body weight loss. This work highlights the potential of targeting MEF2C-dependent AML by selective oral SIK2/3 inhibitors, which was supported by the generative models.

AB  - Marine environments, particularly coastal areas, are significantly impacted by human activities that introduce pollutants. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to link contaminant exposure to adverse ecological effects, with biomonitoring using biomarkers proving especially effective. This review examines publications from 2000 to 2023 on field passive biomonitoring of contamination in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) coastal ecosystems, aiming to identify knowledge gaps and improve conservation strategies. Of the 277 articles analyzed, almost 60 % originated from Brazil, with Argentina contributing 15.52 %, Mexico 14.8 %, and other countries 10.10 %. Metals were the most frequently quantified contaminants (28.77 %), followed by hydrocarbons (13.4 %). However, most studies focused on a single contaminant, overlooking the fact that organisms are typically exposed to complex contaminant mixtures. The most studied species were bivalves, gastropods, and teleost fishes, representing 24.62 %, 22.73 %, and 22.73 % of the total, respectively. Few studies examined aquatic plants and macroalgae, despite their known effectiveness as bioindicators. A majority of the studies (56.21 %) concentrated on a single type of biomarker, with oxidative stress biomarkers being the most common (17.03 %). Although useful as "early warning" signals, these biomarkers lack specificity. Future research should prioritize identifying more specific biomarkers for different contaminants. Given the importance of biomonitoring in conservation management, increasing investment in marine sciences and securing stronger government commitment is crucial.

AB  - Substituting animal proteins with plant-based alternatives offers a sustainable approach to reducing the ecological footprint of livestock farming. This study explores the effect of protein composition on lupin-oat yoghurt analogues, utilizing oat water extract enriched with protein isolates from Lupinus angustifolius (ANG, rich in legumin) and Lupinus albus (ALB, rich in vicilin), fermented with probiotics Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium (BB12). Rheological, textural and microstructural analyses revealed that addition of protein isolates improved water-holding capacity, firmness, cohesiveness and gel strength. However, ALB, rich in vicilin, exhibited superior gel matrix density and stability, while ANG, rich in legumin, contributed to enhanced emulsion stability. Acidification kinetics showed similar pH trends, but lower titratable acidity in ANG, sample suggests distinct protein interactions driven by its legumin-rich profile compared to the vicilin-rich ALB. Fermentation effectively reduced Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAPs) content, particularly galactooligosaccharides, suggesting improved digestibility for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Organic acid profiling showed greater phytic acid degradation in ANG, which may be linked to enhanced mineral bioavailability. Fermentation led to greater protein breakdown in Lupinus albus than Lupinus angustifolius, with SDS-PAGE revealing dominant vicilin proteins in Lupinus albus and legumin proteins in Lupinus angustifolius, which influenced their gelation behaviour. Allergen mapping suggested probiotic fermentation as a potential method for reducing allergenic proteins, with notable degradation of Lup an 1 in ANG. These findings highlight the potential of lupin protein isolates to optimize plant-based yoghurt analogues by enhancing texture, nutrition, and reducing allergenic properties.

AB  - A new bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich beam (BHSB) based on the woodpecker’s head configuration was developed for repeated low-velocity impact resistance improvement. The new design contains four main layers: carbon fiber reinforced plastic top and bottom skins sandwiching rubber and aluminum honeycomb cores. Impact loadings were performed numerically and experimentally in a repeated manner with a hemispherical steel impactor for three energy levels: 7.28 J, 9.74 J, and 12.63 J. In all cases, stresses developed at the bottom skin of BHSB were significantly smaller with substantially lower damage area while sustaining more number of impact than those of conventional honeycomb sandwich beam (HSB). Also, the impact resistance efficiency indices, Ie, which assess overall performance, of both beam designs were compared. Ie of BHSB were 1.65–16.22 times higher, conclusively exhibiting its superiority to HSB in repeated impact resisting performance.

AB  - In addressing fossil fuel supply concerns and their environmental impacts, the building sector, as a major energy consumer, offers an opportunity for renewable energy integration. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy through photovoltaic (PV) panels on building façades stands out as a notable option, though fully realizing their potential remains a challenge. This study introduces a framework for the automated design of PV panels integrated into the façades of existing buildings, enabling thorough assessment based on energy efficiency, economic feasibility, and environmental impact. The process involves capturing the geometry of building envelopes, a deep learning model to identify façade surfaces for PV installation, and simulations to model PV generation and energy demand. An evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm is then employed to determine the PV system design parameters. The results of applying the framework to two university buildings in Alberta, Canada, are presented. For these cases, when equal weights are given to economic, environmental, and energy efficiency objectives, the optimal PV layout can achieve electricity self-sufficiency of 5.16 % and 6.78 %, with greenhouse gas emission rates of 18.26 and 15.69 g CO2-eq./kWh, respectively. The analysis illustrates that adjusting objective priorities yields different optimized solutions to balance competing factors. For example, prioritizing self-sufficiency increases the number of panels while focusing on financial return results in fewer panels and shorter payback periods. Although the financial feasibility of PV systems in Alberta's energy market is currently constrained by low electricity prices, the analysis highlights opportunities for improvement through government incentives and potential electricity price increases.

AB  - Oilfield produced water, a toxic and saline byproduct of the oil and gas industry, has become a global concern due to its adverse environmental and human health impacts. With large volumes of oilfiled produced water generated annually and predictions of even higher volumes in the near future, effective treatment and resource recovery are imperative. This review paper explores the potential of membrane technology, particularly integrated membrane systems, in treating and recovering valuable elements from oilfield produced water. The increasing attention to this topic is evident, but research on resource recovery still needs to be expanded. Membrane technology offers a promising solution due to its efficiency and minimal need for chemical additives or thermal inputs. However, challenges such as fouling, resistance to oil and organics, and economic viability must be addressed. By discussing oilfield produced water characteristics, treatment methods, practical applications, challenges, and prospects, this review underscores the transformative role of membrane technology in turning oilfield produced water into a valuable resource. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of research in developing anti-fouling membranes, sustainable waste management techniques, and efficient cleaning protocols while considering economic implications and market dynamics for resource recovery.

AB  - Modeling and simulation are a powerful and effective problem-solving methodology to study how complex real-world systems behave over time. In the literature, many authors have indicated that discrete event simulation, agent-based simulation, and system dynamics are the primary and most important simulation techniques to aid industrial engineers in making decisions. Given this context, this paper is expected to be an introductory guide, especially for novice simulation modelers willing to work with hybrid simulation, by providing knowledge and insight about the primary simulation methods in industrial engineering. This paper is expected to support the decision about which simulation technique best suits the system being studied. For that, a systematic literature review was conducted based on pre-defined search criteria. After applying the filters and including some relevant papers published in the field, a total of 145 papers were selected. Some of the analysis performed in this study include, for each simulation method, the number of publications over the years and a list of the top 10 sources, countries, and authors according to the number of publications. Besides that, a brief history is provided and the definition of the three primary techniques is discussed, as well as the main characteristics of each technique, such as modeling steps, elements, conceptual modeling tools used, software, inputs and outputs, programming languages, advantages, disadvantages, and application areas. Simulation modelers can use this paper as a quick reference to the primary simulation techniques in order to identify the best tool for a specific simulation project in the field of industrial engineering and related areas.

AB  - Livestock health and welfare monitoring is a tedious and labour-intensive task previously performed manually by humans. However, with recent technological advancements, the livestock industry has adopted the latest AI and computer vision-based techniques empowered by deep learning (DL) models that, at the core, act as decision-making tools. These models have previously been used to address several issues, including individual animal identification, tracking animal movement, body part recognition, and species classification. However, over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in using these models to examine the relationship between livestock behaviour and associated health problems. Several DL-based methodologies have been developed for livestock behaviour recognition, necessitating surveying and synthesising state-of-the-art. Previously, review studies were conducted in a very generic manner and did not focus on a specific problem, such as behaviour recognition. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no review study that focuses on the use of DL specifically for livestock behaviour recognition. As a result, this systematic literature review (SLR) is being carried out. The review was performed by initially searching several popular electronic databases, resulting in 1101 publications. Further assessed through the defined selection criteria, 126 publications were shortlisted. These publications were filtered using quality criteria that resulted in the selection of 44 high-quality primary studies, which were analysed to extract the data to answer the defined research questions. According to the results, DL solved 13 behaviour recognition problems involving 44 different behaviour classes. 23 DL models and 24 networks were employed, with CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv4 being the most common models, and VGG16, CSPDarknet53, GoogLeNet, ResNet101, and ResNet50 being the most popular networks. Ten different matrices were utilised for performance evaluation, with precision and accuracy being the most commonly used. Occlusion and adhesion, data imbalance, and the complex livestock environment were the most prominent challenges reported by the primary studies. Finally, potential solutions and research directions were discussed in this SLR study to aid in developing autonomous livestock behaviour recognition systems.

AB  - The kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanistic studies of sulfur homo- and copolymerization with cyclic and vinyl monomers are described as the major subjects of our review article. Besides, the syntheses, homo- and copolymerization of cyclic mono- and polysulfides are added. The analytical text is complemented with review of the related theoretical topics (mostly DFT), and include theoretical studies of the experimental data of the corresponding sections. Recently, mostly because of the elaboration of the novel process of sulfur copolymerization, so called “inverse vulcanization”, there is renewed interest in polymers of sulfur, with expectation of finding industrial applications, mostly as the Li-sulfur batteries, in optics, removal of toxic metals and biomaterials. We are also discussing papers on the equilibrium between polysulfur and sulfur, in homo- and copolymerization of sulfur with cyclic sulfides and with vinyl monomers. Copolymerization of sulfur is described for cyclic sulfides and vinyl monomers. Analysis of interaction with vinyl monomers involves both low temperatures - then sulfur is merely acting as the chain transfer agent, and for temperatures around the floor temperature, when more or less stable copolymers are formed with high sulfur content. It is also shown that with cyclic monomers the high molar mass copolymers of sulfur were prepared (up to 80 % of sulfur). Analysis of papers describing the molecular structures of copolymers of sulfur are complementing the analysis of the kinetics, thermodynamics and DFT of the studied processes, including the living/controlled polymerization of sulfur with cyclic sulfides. In the final section we analyse the published DFT and other theoretical analyses of the subjects discussed in the major text. These methods have been successfully applied to make predictions of the bond dissociation energies, enthalpies of formation, reaction energies and energy barriers, etc., contributing to a deeper understanding of the chemical processes, as it is shown in this review.

AB  - Background
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is among the most common reasons for disability in young adults. Mobility impairment, primarily related to gait and balance, is ranked as the preeminent concern among persons with MS (PwMS). Gait and balance dysfunction can directly affect the quality of life and activities of daily life in PwMS, hence the importance of effective treatment strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive effect of various non-pharmacological rehabilitation methods, including physiotherapy and electrical stimulation, on gait and mobility in PwMS. Non-pharmacological methods can be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each patient, allowing healthcare providers to create personalized training programs. Furthermore, these methods typically result in minimal or no side effects.
Purpose
This review provides a comprehensive overview of an array of non-pharmacological treatment approaches aimed at enhancing ambulatory performance in PwMS.
Methods
We performed a narrative review of the original papers available in PubMed, investigating the effects of different nonmedical approaches on the gait and balance performance of the PwMS. Reviewed treatment approaches include “exercise, physical rehabilitation, dual-task (DT) rehabilitation, robot-assisted rehabilitation, virtual reality-assisted rehabilitation, game training, electrical stimulation devices, auditory stimulation, visual feedback, and shoe insoles”.
Results and conclusions
Eighty articles were meticulously reviewed. Our study highlights the positive effects of non-pharmacological interventions on patients' quality of life, reducing disability, fatigue, and muscle spasticity. While some methods, including exercise and physiotherapy, showed substantial promise, further research is needed to evaluate whether visual biofeedback and auditory stimulation are preferable over conventional approaches. Additionally, approaches such as functional electrical stimulation, non-invasive brain stimulation, and shoe insoles demonstrate substantial short-term benefits, prompting further investigation into their long-term effects. Non-pharmacological interventions can serve as a valuable complement to medication-based approaches.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Substance use disorder (SUD) have negative consequences for affected individuals and society. Current treatments are moderately effective, partly due to the large heterogeneity in SUDs, including co-occurring psychopathology. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these frequently co-occurring psychiatric conditions is required to develop individualized treatments to increase treatment success rates. We systematically reviewed case-control studies investigating neurobiological differences measured using neuroimaging between participants with SUD only and participants with SUD and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. We searched articles in four databases. Inclusion criteria further existed of an ICD and/or DSM diagnoses based on interview assessment or Fagerström test for Nicotine Dependence scores ≥5. We hypothesised that co-occurring psychopathology could (1) amplify the neurobiological effects of SUD, (2) attenuate it, (3) have unique neurobiological effects, or (4) have no additional neurobiological effects. From 10,076 unique records screened, we included a total of 26 articles investigating the effect of personality disorder cluster B and/or C (6), depression (4), PTSD (4), ADHD (4), schizophrenia (8), bipolar disorder (1) or anxiety disorders (1) on SUD. We found amplifying effects of co-occurring schizophrenia and personality disorder, unique effects of schizophrenia, ADHD and personality disorder, and attenuating or no effect of depression on SUD. Findings on PTSD were contradictory. In conclusion, different co-occurring psychiatric disorder have distinct effects on the neurobiology of SUD.

AB  - Social media platforms have evolved into an online representation of our social interactions. We may use the resources they provide to analyze phenomena that occur within them, such as the development and viralization of offensive and hostile content. In today’s polarized world, the escalating nature of this behavior is cause for concern in modern society. This research includes an in-depth examination of previous efforts and strategies for detecting and preventing hateful content on the social network Twitter, as well as a novel classification approach based on users’ profiles, related social environment and generated tweets. This paper’s contribution is threefold: (i) an improvement in the performance of the HaterNet algorithm, an expert system developed in collaboration with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security (Ministry of the Interior) that is capable of identifying and monitoring the evolution of hate speech on Twitter using an LTSM + MLP neural network architecture. To that end, a model based on BERT, HaterBERT, has been created and tested using HaterNet’s public dataset, providing results that show a significant improvement; (ii) A methodology to create a user database in the form of a relational network to infer textual and centrality features. This contribution, SocialGraph, has been independently tested with various traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, demonstrating its usefulness in spotting haters; (iii) a final model, SocialHaterBERT, that integrates the previous two approaches by analyzing features other than those inherent in the text. Experiment results reveal that this last contribution greatly improves outcomes, establishing a new field of study that transcends textual boundaries, paving the way for future research in coupled models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.

AB  - The increasing adoption of collaborative robots to support job execution in manufacturing has catalyzed companies’ attention to safety and well-being issues. Sharing the human-centric perspective and harmonious human–machine collaboration concepts emphasized by Industry 5.0, the design phase of a collaborative workstation must integrate both psychological and physical risk evaluations to provide a safe and inclusive work environment suitable for a diversified workforce. Accelerating the pre-deployment phase to quickly reconfigure workstation design and assess its impact on workload balancing and task sequencing during the deployment of assembly lines still represents a challenging task considering the available software tools. This research proposes a new mathematical model to accelerate the design of ergonomic human-robot collaborative workstations based on task alternatives and the combined consideration of postural assessment and fatigue analyses for each of them to design an ergo-friendly collaborative environment. Surface electromyography analysis is jointly adopted with postural risk assessment measured with inertial measurement units and developed by a digital ergonomic platform to determine the optimal workplace configuration for tools, equipment, and resources to promote physical well-being while considering station productivity. Experimental tests are performed to investigate arm muscles and postural risk assessment for different configurations of workstation design and collaborative human-robot job progression. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing simulation software to quickly generate and assess alternative scenarios and find a trade-off between ergo-quality levels and system performance. The final discussion offers valuable information for decision-makers and practitioners to facilitate the integration of human factors throughout the early stages of ergo-friendly workspace design, while effectively managing the complexity generated by resource allocation and collaborative robots.

AB  - The timely administration of antivenom is the most effective method currently available to reduce the burden of snakebite envenoming (SBE), a neglected tropical disease that most often affects rural agricultural global populations. There is increasing interest in the development of adjunctive small molecule and biologic therapeutics that target the most problematic venom components to bridge the time-gap between initial SBE and the administration of antivenom. Unique combinations of these therapeutics could provide relief from the toxic effects of regional groupings of medically relevant snake species. The application a PRISMA/PICO literature search methodology demonstrated an increasing interest in the rapid administration of therapies to improve patient symptoms and outcomes after SBE. Advice from expert interviews and considerations regarding the potential routes of therapy administration, anatomical bite location, and species-specific venom delivery have provided a framework to identify ideal metrics and potential hurdles for the development of a field-based medical device that could be used immediately after SBE to deliver adjunctive therapies. The use of subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection were identified as potential routes of administration of both small molecule and biologic therapies. The development of a field-based medical device for the delivery of adjunctive SBE therapies presents unique challenges that will require a collaborative and transdisciplinary approach to be successful.

AB  - The significant influence of colour on life and the numerous advantages of plastics over metals, ceramics, wood and other materials result in the incorporation of colour into polymers through a variety of techniques, including internally and externally. The widespread use of plastics, inappropriate trash disposal and inefficient recycling result in a substantial release of plastic into the environment. Environmental factors, such as heat, light, moisture, chemicals and wind, can degrade polymers, altering the composition, structure and morphology to a certain degree. This situation can result in the production of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) and associated chemicals. Ecosystems are seriously endangered by materials resulting from continuous deterioration, fragmentation and ageing of plastics. Majority of the commonly used plastics are coloured, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring coloured MPs. The influence of colour on MP formation, environmental effect, identification and waste management topics has not received enough attention. This review article addresses various concerns regarding coloured MPs, including their abundance, leaking, ageing, waste management and sustainability. Moreover, this work is based on research from field-based articles on plastics, MPs and coloured MPs. In the context of plastic pollution, future strategies for more effective mitigation of coloured MPs were also explored. Furthermore, this work attempts to assist in creating a clear road map for decision-making, selecting the optimal option for a given goal and developing a plan for expanding and improving an existing strategy.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising customer relationship management (CRM) across various sectors, fundamentally altering strategic business operations. This study examines the capabilities of AI-powered CRM systems, drawing on empirical evidence arising from thematic analyses of 64 scholarly articles and insights gained from 24 in-depth interviews with CRM experts. The research identifies and systematically categorises three major dimensions and eight sub-dimensions of AI-powered CRM capabilities, providing a structured framework that encapsulates the complex interplay that occurs between these elements. These dimensions include data management, multi-channel integration, and tailored service offerings, each underpinning the nuanced integration of AI into CRM practices. Critically, the study integrates these findings within the theoretical framework of the microfoundations of Dynamic Capabilities (DC), enriching the discourse on how AI can strategically enhance CRM systems and offering a nuanced understanding of the factors driving AI adoption within CRM. By mapping these capabilities against the microfoundations of DC theory, the research delineates the strategic implications for organisations striving to leverage AI to enhance their competitive advantage.

AB  - In order to tackle the problem of abstractive summarization of long multi-sentence texts, it is critical to construct an efficient model, which can learn and represent multiple compositionalities better. In this paper, we introduce a temporal hierarchical pointer generator network that can represent multiple compositionalities in order to handle longer sequences of texts with a deep structure. We demonstrate how a multilayer gated recurrent neural network organizes itself with the help of an adaptive timescale in order to represent the compositions. The temporal hierarchical network is implemented with a multiple timescale architecture where the timescale of each layer is also learned during the training process through error backpropagation through time. We evaluate our proposed model using an Introduction-Abstract summarization dataset from scientific articles and the CNN/Daily Mail summarization benchmark dataset. The results illustrate that, we successfully implement a summary generation system for long texts by using the multiple timescale with adaptation concept. We also show that we have improved the summary generation system with our proposed model on the benchmark dataset.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms play an essential role in bioinformatics and allow exploring the vast and noisy biological data in unrivaled ways. This paper is a systematic review of the applications of machine learning in the study of HIV neutralizing antibodies. This significant and vast research domain can pave the way to novel treatments and to a vaccine. We selected the relevant papers by investigating the available literature from the Web of Science and PubMed databases in the last decade. The computational methods are applied in neutralization potency prediction, neutralization span prediction against multiple viral strains, antibody–virus binding sites detection, enhanced antibodies design, and the study of the antibody-induced immune response. These methods are viewed from multiple angles spanning data processing, model description, feature selection, evaluation, and sometimes paper comparisons. The algorithms are diverse and include supervised, unsupervised, and generative types. Both classical machine learning and modern deep learning were taken into account. The review ends with our ideas regarding future research directions and challenges.

AB  - Condition monitoring involves detecting, diagnosing, or predicting faults or failures in industrial equipment. Given advances in the underlying artificial intelligence solutions and internet of things-based technologies, condition monitoring has the potential to improve industrial maintenance processes rapidly. Adopting condition monitoring-based technologies requires evaluating their engineering and financial benefits to determine whether the investment is justified. An increasing number of studies describe procedures to evaluate condition monitoring-based maintenance, but the literature lacks a review of these evaluation studies to identify research opportunities and best practices. This systematic review aims to report and analyze the evaluation methods for using condition monitoring-based technologies in industrial maintenance. This review identified 465 relevant peer-reviewed studies between 2001 and 2023, from which 42 articles met the eligibility criteria. For each article, this paper analyzed facets of the evaluation process related to the study’s characterizations of the industrial application, condition monitoring, maintenance deployment, evaluation techniques, performance measures, and economic analysis. Collectively, these results yield several insights. Few condition monitoring evaluation studies exist for manufacturing systems, unlike the domains of energy systems and transportation modes. Also, many studies lack details about condition monitoring and maintenance models. Additionally, the evaluation techniques across most studies can improve with combinations of analytical frameworks, simulation, and expanded sensitivity analysis. Lastly, the reviewed studies are difficult to directly compare due to heterogeneity in economic analysis, performance measures, and uncertainty analysis — indicating an opportunity for future research to structure comprehensive reporting items to enhance the comparability of domain-specific condition monitoring-based maintenance evaluations. Based on the literature review and analyses, this review suggests specific recommendations for future condition monitoring evaluation and opportunities for further research.

AB  - In the context of global climate change, tea plants are at risk from elevating environmental stress factors. Coping with this problem relies upon the understanding of tea plant stress response and its underlying mechanisms. Over the past two decades, research in this field has prospered with the contributions of scientists worldwide. Aiming in providing a comprehensive perspective of the research field related to tea plant stress response, we present a bibliometric analysis of the this area. Our results demonstrate the most studied stresses, global contribution, authorship and collaboration, and trending research topics. We highlight the importance of flavonoid metabolites in tea plant stress response, particularly their role in maintaining redox homeostasis, yield, and adjusting tea quality under stress conditions. Further research on the flavonoid response under various stress conditions can promote the development of cultivation measures, thereby improving stress resistance and tea quality.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the practical application of Lean with Six Sigma and Agile to create a powerful, synergetic and novel process improvement (PI) method. Going beyond the traditional definitions of Lean, we establish a Factory Physics view of PI which doesn't technically discriminate Lean from non-Lean. We apply a design science approach to help a global bank deploy a continuous process improvement program. By reviewing the literature on PI, we recognize Lean additives viz., Lean Six Sigma and Lean Agile, when synergized, help overcome the limitations of individual PI practices. Our design takes its roots from Factory Physics (FP) and emerges as a novel model synthesizing the theoretical lens of FP with Lean additives for field application. Besides the design of ‘Lean Additives Program’, we deployed the model in several iterations, and studied its performance over a three-year period. The improved system exhibited high levels of efficiency and effectiveness. The longitudinal case evidence demonstrates that Lean additives offer both operational and strategic benefits in firms.

AB  - Persistent luminescence is an optical phenomenon where materials continue to emit light after the cessation of the excitation source which leads to different applications in areas like bioimaging, information storage, anticounterfeiting, etc. This review focuses on the latest advancements in near-infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence (PersL) materials doped with Cr3+, Mn4+, Mn2+, Fe3+ and Ni2+along with recent advances in the synthesis and mechanisms associated with the afterglow. A comprehensive discussion on the various types of defects and their importance in NIR PersL materials is also included, along with a section dedicated to the techniques used to characterize these defects and application of NIR PersL materials in different areas. The review also examines the different strategies to improve the NIR PersL. It starts with a brief description of the history of the PersL and then discusses the reported NIR PersL phosphors activated by manganese, chromium, iron and nickel ions. Understanding the mechanism associated with PersL is very important to develop a novel PersL phosphor, so the review discussed the role of defects and traps in PersL along with different models which include the conduction band model, oxygen vacancy model, and quantum tunneling model which is followed by few main applications of PersL materials and culminated by concluding and associated challenges and future directions in this ever-growing field.

AB  - Anaerobic Digestion (AD) technology emerges as a viable solution for managing municipal organic waste, offering pollution reduction and the generation of biogas and fertilisers. This study reviews the research works for the advancements in AD implementation to effectively impact the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the study critically analyses responsible waste management that contributes to health and safety, elevating quality of life in both rural and urban areas and, finally, creates a map of AD outputs onto all 17 SDGs. Finally, the assessment employs the three sustainability pillars (i.e., economic, environmental, and social perspectives) to examine the direct and indirect links between AD and all 17 UN SDGs. The findings reveal substantial progress, such as poverty reduction through job creation, bolstering economic growth (SDGs 1, 8, 10, 12), enhancing agricultural productivity (SDG 2), advancing renewable energy usage and diminishing reliance on fossil fuels (SDG 7), fostering inclusive education and gender equality (SDGs 4, 5, 9), combating climate change (SDG 13), transforming cities into sustainable and harmonious environments (SDGs 11, 16, 17), and curbing environmental pollution (SDGs 3, 6, 12, 14, 15). Nonetheless, the study highlights the need for further efforts to achieve the SDG targets, particularly in part of liquid and solid fertilisers as the AD outputs.

AB  - Globally, cancer is regarded as a severe health issue. Among these is breast cancer (BC), the second most common kind in women after skin cancer. According to statistical data from the NIH Cancer Institute, the expected number of cases was around 3 lakh people, with a 7.1 % fatality rate. The rise of multidrug resistance (MDR) in British Columbia is a severe issue as it lowers the effectiveness of existing treatments. Traditional MDR treatment approaches in BC have a number of drawbacks, including toxicity, high cost, early discharge, restricted drug load before target, and poor effectiveness. Preventing MDR BC has depended heavily on developing innovative therapy delivery methods utilizing nanomedicine and new approaches to diagnosing and treating BC. This review discusses MDR in BC and its pathophysiology in relation to tumor kinetics. It focuses on the latest therapeutic approaches over the traditional methods like Surgery, Chemotherapy, Nanomedicine, Phototherapy, Immunotherapy, and Gene therapy. It also describes diagnostic techniques using MRI/PET, Mammography, Microwave Sensing, In-silico methods, Molecular diagnostic techniques, and AI-machine learning-based tools. It also discussed the limitations of nanoparticles in diagnosing and treating BC. This review article aims to identify new and efficient ways to diagnose and treat MDR BC and prevent tumor recurrence.

AB  - Hybrid energy storage systems integrate diverse storage technologies to enhance system performance, efficiency, and longevity. Despite a plurality of proposed energy management strategies to operate these systems and a significant number of reviews on this topic, the field lacks a systematic, actionable and reusable summary of available energy management strategies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-review of available review articles to ascertain a joint base for representative energy management strategies for hybrid energy storage systems. In subsequent reviews of each determined class, we extracted, defined, and detailed core concepts, which were then implemented in Python for demonstration and analysis. We identified four representatives: filter-based, deadzone-based, fuzzy-logic-based, and model-predictive-control-based energy management. Each one is discussed with its operational mechanisms and implementable equations and is illustrated through simulations. Notably, we excluded machine-learning-based candidates due to the limited foundation and generalizability in the current literature. With the identified representatives, we seek to provide a foundation and framework for further development, including quantitative assessments of energy management performance in various configurations. Also, this work facilitates targeted and effective enhancements in energy management development for each class, accelerating future research and supporting industry stakeholders to develop more efficient renewable energy systems.

AB  - Recent software development methodologies emphasize iterative and incremental evolution to align with stakeholders’ needs. This perpetual and rapid software evolution demands ongoing research into verification practices and technologies that ensure swift responsiveness and effective management of software delta increments. Strategies such as code review have been widely adopted for development and verification, ensuring readability and consistency in the delta increments of software projects. However, the integration of techniques to detect and visually report delta changes within the Graphical User Interface (GUI) software applications remains an underutilized process. In this paper, we set out to achieve two objectives. First, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies concerning GUI change detection in desktop, web, and mobile applications to recognize common practices. Second, we introduce a novel change detection tool capable of highlighting delta GUI changes for this diverse range of applications. To accomplish our first objective, we performed a systematic mapping of the literature using the Scopus database. To address the second objective, we designed and developed a GUI change detection tool. This tool simultaneously transits and compares state models inferred by a scriptless testing tool, enabling the detection and highlighting of GUI changes to detect the widgets or functionalities that have been added, removed, or modified. Our study reveals the existence of a multitude of techniques for change detection in specific GUI systems with different objectives. However, there is no widely adopted technique suitable for the diverse range of existing desktop, web, and mobile applications. Our tool and findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using inferred state models to highlight between 8 and 20 GUI changes in software delta increments containing a large number of changes over months and between 4 and 6 GUI changes in delta increments of small iterations performed over multiple weeks. Moreover, some of these changes were recognized by the software developers as GUI failures that required a fix. Finally, we expose the motivation for using this technique to help developers and testers analyze GUI changes to validate delta increments and detect potential GUI failures, thereby fostering knowledge dissemination and paving the way to standard practices.

AB  - Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.

AB  - Smart manufacturing has recently become the industry’s buzzword, with the promise of improved performance and greater agility. Also named Industry 4.0 (I4), this concept relies upon a system of systems made of myriads of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) components. Along with the expected enhancements come new cyber-threats as the attack surface and pathways will increase. This conference paper argues that I4’s cyber resilience demands an ad hoc research programme. Firstly, we briefly compare Operations Technology (OT) with classic Information Technology (IT) and IoT technology to highlight their differences and the latters’ impact on cyber resilience. Secondly, we depict the concept of operation of future I4 systems and point out the specific challenges they raise. Next, we review the concept of through-life cyber resilience assurance and complement the list of future I4 environments’ challenges. Fourthly, we present Cranfield University’s Manufacturing Informatics Centre’s (MIC) research & education strategy and show how it relates to the identified challenges. In our conclusion, we suggest ways to foster collaboration between the Industry, the Government and the MIC to address these challenges and to allow the United Kingdom to approach I4’s challenges with increased confidence.

AB  - Dirac sought an interpretation of mathematical formalism in terms of physical entities and Einstein insisted that physics should describe “the real states of the real systems”. While Bell inequalities put into question the reality of states, modern device-independent approaches do away with the idea of entities: physical theory may contain no physical systems. Focusing on the correlations between operationally defined inputs and outputs, device-independent methods promote a view more distant from the conventional one than Einstein׳s ‘principle theories’ were from ‘constructive theories’. On the examples of indefinite causal orders and almost quantum correlations, we ask a puzzling question: if physical theory is not about systems, then what is it about? Device-independent models suggest that physical theory can be ‘about’ languages.

AB  - Accurate ship trajectory prediction (STP) is crucial to realise the early warning of ship collision and ensure maritime safety. Driven by advancements in artificial intelligence technology, deep learning-based STP has become a predominant approach in the research field of ship collision avoidance. This paper, based on a state-of-the-art survey of the existing STP research progress, aims to develop a new bi-directional information fusion-driven prediction model that enables the achievement of more accurate STP results by addressing the drawbacks of the classical methods in the field. In this context, a cascading network model is developed by combining two bi-directional networks in a specific order. It incorporates the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network into a single three-layer, information-enhanced network. It takes advantage of both networks to realise more accurate prediction of ship trajectories. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is comprehensively evaluated using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from three water areas representing traffic scenarios of different safety concerns. The superiority of the proposed model is verified through comparative analysis with twenty other methods, including the state-of-the-art STP in the literature. The finding reveals that the new model is better than all the benchmarked ones, and thus, the new STP solution in this paper makes new contributions to improving autonomous navigation and maritime safety.

AB  - Bibliometrics is a powerful tool for analyzing knowledge domains and revealing their cognitive-epistemological structure. Different mathematical models and statistical techniques have been proposed and tested to carry out bibliometric analyses and demonstrate their effectiveness in uncovering how fields of research are intellectually structured. These include two hybrid techniques that allow clusters of related documents obtained from a co-citation analysis to be labeled using textual data. This paper reports on the findings of a bibliometric study in which these hybrid techniques are combined to: (1) build and visualize the network of publications shaping the intellectual structure of the smart city research field by considering the first two decades of literature dealing with this subject; (2) map the clusters of thematically-related publications; and (3) reveal the emerging development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster represents and the strategic principles they embody. The five development paths which the analysis uncovers and the strategic principles each stands on are then compared by reviewing the most recent literature on smart cities. Overall, this bibliometric study offers a systematic review of the research on smart cities produced since 1992 and helps bridge the division affecting this research area, demonstrating that it is caused by the dichotomous nature of the development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster relates to and the strategic principles they in turn support.

AB  - Model-driven development is a model-centric software development paradigm that automates the development process by converting high-level models into low-level code and documents. To maintain synchronization between models and code/documents — which can evolve independently — this paper introduces BIT, a bidirectional language that can serve as a conventional template language for model-to-text transformations. However, a BIT program can function as both a printer, generating text by filling template holes with values from the input model, and a parser, putting parsed values back into the model. BIT comprises a surface language for better usability and a core language for formal definition. We define the semantics of the core language based on the theory of bidirectional transformation, and provide the translation from the surface to the core. We present the proof sketch of the well behavedness of BIT as a formal evidence of soundness. We also conduct three case studies to empirically demonstrate the expressiveness and the effectiveness of BIT. Based on the proof and the case studies, BIT covers the major features of existing template languages, and offers sufficient expressiveness to define real-world model-to-text transformations that can be executed bidirectionally and incrementally.

AB  - As computer vision algorithms increase in capability, their applications in clinical systems will become more pervasive. These applications include: diagnostics, such as colonoscopy and bronchoscopy; guiding biopsies, minimally invasive interventions, and surgery; automating instrument motion; and providing image guidance using pre-operative scans. Many of these applications depend on the specific visual nature of medical scenes and require designing algorithms to perform in this environment. In this review, we provide an update to the field of camera-based tracking and scene mapping in surgery and diagnostics in medical computer vision. We begin with describing our review process, which results in a final list of 515 papers that we cover. We then give a high-level summary of the state of the art and provide relevant background for those who need tracking and mapping for their clinical applications. After which, we review datasets provided in the field and the clinical needs that motivate their design. Then, we delve into the algorithmic side, and summarize recent developments. This summary should be especially useful for algorithm designers and to those looking to understand the capability of off-the-shelf methods. We maintain focus on algorithms for deformable environments while also reviewing the essential building blocks in rigid tracking and mapping since there is a large amount of crossover in methods. With the field summarized, we discuss the current state of the tracking and mapping methods along with needs for future algorithms, needs for quantification, and the viability of clinical applications. We then provide some research directions and questions. We conclude that new methods need to be designed or combined to support clinical applications in deformable environments, and more focus needs to be put into collecting datasets for training and evaluation.

Consequently, researchers and industrial engineers have continuously focused on this area. Manufacturing companies possess extensive maintenance reports or logs containing valuable textual information, which offers a new avenue for exploring effective industrial maintenance methods. Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, has demonstrated remarkable potential in analyzing maintenance reports and achieving promising results in various tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review that specifically concentrates on the applications of NLP approaches employed in the field of industrial maintenance. Additionally, this review analyzed the datasets utilized in previous studies and the evaluation measures adopted, which can serve as a valuable resource for other researchers seeking potential solutions in maintenance. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges encountered in applying NLP to industrial maintenance and outlines future research directions in this domain. By conducting this systematic literature review, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of NLP applications in industrial maintenance, identify gaps in the existing literature, and guide future research efforts in leveraging NLP techniques for enhanced maintenance practices.

AB  - The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.

AB  - Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is an important area in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the goal of shortening a long text into a more compact version by conveying the most important points in a readable form. ATS applications continue to evolve and utilize effective approaches that are being evaluated and implemented by researchers. State-of-the-Art (SotA) technologies that demonstrate cutting-edge performance and accuracy in abstractive ATS are deep neural sequence-to-sequence models, Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, and Transfer Learning (TL) approaches, including Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs). The graph-based Transformer architecture and PTLMs have influenced tremendous advances in NLP applications. Additionally, the incorporation of recent mechanisms, such as the knowledge-enhanced mechanism, significantly enhanced the results. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advances in the area of abstractive text summarization for works spanning the past six years. Past and present problems are described, as well as their proposed solutions. In addition, abstractive ATS datasets and evaluation measurements are also highlighted. The paper concludes by comparing the best models and discussing future research directions.
