AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has brought the indoor airborne transmission issue to the forefront. Although ventilation systems provide clean air and dilute indoor contaminated air, there is strong evidence that airborne transmission is the main route for contamination spread. This review paper aims to critically investigate ventilation impacts on particle spread and identify efficient ventilation strategies in controlling aerosol distribution in clinical and non-clinical environments. This article also examines influential ventilation design features (i.e., exhaust location) affecting ventilation performance in preventing aerosols spread. This paper shortlisted published documents for a review based on identification (keywords), pre-processing, screening, and eligibility of these articles. The literature review emphasizes the importance of ventilation systems’ design and demonstrates all strategies (i.e., mechanical ventilation) could efficiently remove particles if appropriately designed. The study highlights the need for occupant-based ventilation systems, such as personalized ventilation instead of central systems, to reduce cross-infections. The literature underlines critical impacts of design features like ventilation rates and the number and location of exhausts and suggests designing systems considering airborne transmission. This review underpins that a higher ventilation rate should not be regarded as a sole indicator for designing ventilation systems because it cannot guarantee reducing risks. Using filtration and decontamination devices based on building functionalities and particle sizes can also increase ventilation performance. This paper suggests future research on optimizing ventilation systems, particularly in high infection risk spaces such as multi-storey hotel quarantine facilities. This review contributes to adjusting ventilation facilities to control indoor aerosol transmission.

AB  - The microservice architecture structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, enhancing development practices and maintainability. It impacts system performance and scalability, which are influenced by the architectural design, the system deployment, and usage. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) on the assessment of performance and scalability in the microservice architecture, aiming to identify research gaps and assess the current state of knowledge. The review protocol screened 801 studies, selecting 29 primary studies for detailed analysis. We perform comparisons of studies and try to identify the main gaps in current research and suggest areas for further investigation. The main conclusion is that the current research partially addresses the dimensions associated with the performance and scalability qualities of microservice systems. In particular, there is a lack of comparative studies of architectural patterns and styles or comparable assessment models and methods. Therefore, a systematic approach is lacking and the paper reports a set of open research trends to guide researchers in the area of microservice-based software architecture quality assessment.

AB  - Context:
Knowledge sharing is essential for collaboration and innovation in software development but is often hindered by barriers such as lack of motivation and information overload. Gamification has been proposed as a strategy to address these challenges by enhancing engagement and fostering collaboration.
Objective:
This study aimed to investigate the role of gamification in fostering knowledge sharing among software developers, focusing on gamification elements and solutions, the contexts and impacts of gamification, and the associated limitations.
Methods:
A Rapid Review methodology was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility. A systematic search of the Scopus database was performed in June 2024, yielding 1180 studies. After applying a six-stage selection process, including duplicate removal, title, and abstract screening, and full-text assessment based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included. Bias and quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), 2018 version. Key information was extracted and organized using the Parsifal tool to address three research questions.
Results:
Gamification significantly enhanced knowledge sharing by motivating participation, improving teamwork, and fostering positive behavioral changes. Common gamification elements included leaderboards, points, badges, and rewards, which were effective in promoting engagement. However, challenges such as superficial engagement, overemphasis on rewards, and difficulties in measuring long-term effectiveness were identified. Sustainable engagement strategies and robust evaluation frameworks were recommended to address these limitations.
Conclusions:
Gamification is a promising approach for overcoming barriers regarding knowledge-sharing in software development. Practitioners and researchers can leverage well-designed gamification mechanisms to create collaborative and innovative environments that enhance knowledge transfer and developer engagement. Future research should focus on sustainable strategies, tailored gamification approaches, and the development of robust metrics for evaluating gamification’s effectiveness.

KW  - Formal methods
AB  - Context:
Engineering self-adaptive systems to guarantee the required quality properties is challenging and particularly in presence of uncertainties. Such uncertainties may occur in a variety of situations, ranging from variations in the system’s operating environment to ambiguity while selecting the appropriate adaptation option. Formal methods provide a rigorous means to specify and verify the behaviour of self-adaptive systems. They are applied both during system design and at runtime to provide guarantees on the required properties of self-adaptive systems. However, existing approaches generally use exhaustive verification at runtime to pick adaptation options and achieve adaptation objectives, which is time and resource consuming.
Objective:
Aiming to tackle this shortcoming, we target a twofold objective. Firstly, we reduce the adaptation space, and then we predict the impact of each adaptation plan on the rest of system qualities, to assist the decision-making process in determining the most suitable adaptation plans and side effects.
Method:
An Adaptation-space Reducer component is added to the analyser element; it uses deep learning to reduce the adaptation space. Furthermore, the planner element has been extended with a Decision Impact Predictor component, which employs quantitative analysis to forecast the impact of a decision.
Results:
The DLA4EDM is defined as an approach for providing self-adaptive systems (SASs) with an efficient decision-making process. Our approach is applied on a self-adaptive Internet of Things application and the obtained results are compared to those of other approaches. Results show that the adaptation space is reduced by 97.57%, and the error rate in the decision-making is very low.
Conclusion:
Reducing the adaptation space and resolving uncertainties to be faced in the decision-making of self-adaptive systems contribute considerably to enhance the efficiency and quality of the adaptation process and hence ensure that the quality requirements are met. Evaluating the impact of the identified adaptation plans on the obtained guarantees ensures that the system is effectively operational.

AB  - Heat pumps (HPs) have gained popularity as an energy-efficient substitute for traditional heating and cooling systems. This is due to their ability to transfer heat rather than generate it, resulting in higher efficiency, lower operating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint, thereby making them competitively applicable in different sectors for heating and/or cooling supply. In this study, the focus is on bi-functional HPs (bi-FHPs), machines that provide both heating and cooling, either simultaneously or in different seasons via cycle reversing. This way, the machine becomes suitable for a wide range of applications such as heating and cooling in buildings, industrial processes, electric vehicles, etc., although its performance will still depend on various factors such as climate conditions, working fluid, system design, compressor efficiency, and so on. This study reviews all literature on bi-FHPs and any effective technical or environmental parameters on their techno-economic and environmental effectiveness. It is observed that research activities on bi-FHPs come in several directions such as developing advanced control strategies, investigating the impact of environmental and operational factors, assessing economic feasibility, developing operation strategies, integrating with renewable energy sources, hybridization with other energy systems for better flexibility and resource sharing, and examining suitability for different applications and building types. It is found that bi-FHPs have great potential for cost reduction and sustainability owing to their multi-functionality but there are several challenges to overcome and factors to consider making them impactful. Pursuing research in these areas can help better understand their potential, enhance their performance and sustainability, and promote their widespread adoption as key technology for sustainable heating and cooling.

AB  - Accurate, fast, and non-intrusive Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) estimations of existing buildings are crucial for informed decision-making in retrofit projects. A systematic integrative literature review was conducted following the PRISMA standard (1997–2024). This is the first review with statistical and critical thematic analysis on this topic, synthesizing a theoretical framework for future research directions. The review identified 63 relevant sources. Quantitative analysis reveals exponential growth of publications since 2017 on ML for HTC estimation, with leadership from China, USA and India. Qualitative analysis assessed existing ML methodologies, data collection protocols, and validation frameworks. Indoor and outdoor temperatures emerge as the most frequently used parameters; 45 % of studies use hourly measurement intervals. High-frequency data collection offers superior capture of thermal dynamics but poses challenges in data storage and processing. Neural network-based approaches (particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) dominate to capture non-linear thermal relationships. Key challenges include data quality requirements, computational efficiency, and the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability. A concerning finding shows 25.7 % of studies lack validation against established methods, highlighting a critical gap in standardization. This analysis provides insights into current methodological trends, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions for advancing ML applications in this field. Findings emphasize the need for standardized validation protocols, improved data collection strategies, and integrated approaches connecting component-level and whole-building analyses.

AB  - Rail suicide is a complex problem with significant adverse social and economic impacts. Systems thinking approaches are commonly used to understand emergent outcomes in complex systems. Systems thinking takes the system as the unit of analysis; often using a hierarchical representation to show how decisions and actions made across levels of a system (e.g., by governments, regulators, industry associations, companies, and individuals) can interact to create adverse outcomes. However, the extent to which rail suicide research has explored the problem from a systems thinking approach is unclear. A systematic review was conducted to identify: (1) the theories and methods that have been used to investigate rail suicide in the peer reviewed literature; (2) the contributory and demographic/risk factors for rail suicide identified across system levels; and (3) the preventative measures to address rail suicide that have been evaluated in published studies. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines and the systems thinking techniques AcciMap and PreventiMap were used to map factors and interventions across system levels. Gaps identified included a lack of consideration of contributory factors at higher system levels, that few preventative measures have been subject to evaluation, and that there has been little consideration of relationships between preventative measures. The review highlights the need for structured systems approaches to gain a more holistic understanding of rail suicide and to design more effective preventative measures.

AB  - Market demands for high-tech products constantly evolve by product specification. To be competitive, a production system must be flexible and reconfigurable when facing mass customization. Flexible assembly line (FAL) enables mixed production with high efficiency. One example is graphic processing unit (GPU) cards. FAL requires comprehensive system design and scheduling to fully utilize the resources. This study adopts agent-based simulation (ABS) modelling for a FAL because of the abilities of ABS in flexibility and scalability. The proposed framework consists of three parts: real environment, virtual environment, and evaluation and analysis. This study uses agent-based simulation modelling to elaborate on sequencing and scheduling performances in the GPU-card assembly line. The Pareto frontier analysis is conducted to resolve conflicts between part tardiness and throughput.

KW  - Determinants of innovation
AB  - Competitiveness and long-term sustainability are closely tied to the innovation capability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, a systematic understanding of the key determinants of this capability remains limited and fragmented. While prior studies have examined individual innovation factors, few have comprehensively integrated the internal and external dimensions that shape the innovation capacity of SMEs across diverse contexts. In response to recent global disruptions and rapid technological transformations, this study addresses a critical gap by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliometric analysis of 122 high-quality empirical studies published between 2020 and 2024. Guided by the central question—what are the most influential determinants of innovation capability in SMEs, and how do these vary over time and across regions—this review synthesizes various empirical findings. Six major determinants are identified: Knowledge and Learning Capabilities (r = 0.98), Organizational Structure and Culture (r = 0.96), Innovation Management and Strategy (r = 0.81), External Networks and Collaborations (r = 0.70), Market Orientation and Customer Insights (r = 0.47), and Technology and Digitalization (r = 0.05). Additionally, the analysis identifies cross-cutting cited factors, such as Entrepreneurial Orientation and Absorptive Capacity that emerge as enablers. SME innovation capability is thus shaped by strategic, cultural, and knowledge-based determinants, alongside these aforementioned factors. This study adopts a hybrid method that combines a structured SLR with bibliometric coupling using VOSviewer to map thematic clusters and publication trends. The review reveals notable geographical and temporal patterns in SME innovation research, highlighting China’s consistent leadership in technology-oriented studies. Moreover, Knowledge Management, External Networks, and Digital Transformation emerge as an interconnected foundation for sustainable innovation in SMEs. Compared to earlier frameworks, this study offers a key advantage by explicitly incorporating geographical and temporal dynamics into the analysis. This contextual approach deepens our understanding of how the relevance of innovation capability determinants shifts across regions and periods, enabling more targeted and adaptive strategies. Thus, this research provides a systems-oriented foundation for future longitudinal studies that examine how interconnected determinants collectively drive sustainable innovation outcomes.

The review aims to identify key areas of application, technologies employed, virtualized elements, and economic aspects, as well as to explore the objectives, motivations, scope, challenges, and limitations faced in Software Engineering when conceptualizing metaverse environments. Additionally, the study examines the nature, knowledge area, type, and validation of the studies included in the review.
Methods:
This study was conducted using the Kitchenham methodology for systematic literature reviews (SLR). A total of 35 primary studies were selected from major scientific databases, including IEEE, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. These studies were evaluated to extract relevant data.
Results:
We have identified application areas, technologies used, virtualized elements and economic aspects used, as well as the objectives, motivations, scope, challenges and limitations in Software Engineering related to the conceptualization of environments and non-functional characteristics of the metaverse. The nature, area of knowledge, type and validation of the studies chosen in this review are also analyzed.
Conclusion:
The study concludes that while the metaverse presents huge opportunities across multiple domains, its development faces significant challenges, particularly in software engineering related to the non-functional aspects of these environments. To address these challenges, future research should focus on the application of the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm, which could optimize development processes and better manage the complexities of the metaverse.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to systematically examine available empirical evidence on the impact of human factors (HF) in the design and management of manufacturing operations on system quality performance. A systematic review was conducted to map the linkages between the human-system fit in the design of operations systems (OS) with production quality. A total of 73 empirical studies were identified linking HF to OS performance in manufacturing. Quality risk factors included HF aspects in product design, process design and workstation design of the manufacturing OS. Quality deficits were associated with undesirable human effects of workload like fatigue and injury-related risk factors. Forty-six percent of the studies reported on efforts to improve HF in the OS with effect sizes for quality improvements reaching up to 86%. The paper documents available quality risk factors in the design of OS. It also provides a conceptual framework explaining HF-Quality linkage.

AB  - Despite advances in operational efficiency, industry poses a significant threat to environmental sustainability, thus preventing progress towards a net-zero economy. This research investigates the transformative potential of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in advancing sustainable maintenance practices. Defined as resource-minimizing and environmentally sustainable approaches while maintaining operational effectiveness, sustainable maintenance promises a mutually beneficial scenario for organizations and the environment. This paper employs a systematic approach including an extensive structured literature review and expert interviews with industry representatives. By analyzing the intersection of I4.0 technologies and sustainable maintenance principles, key technological solutions with the potential to significantly reduce resource consumption, minimize waste generation, and reduce emissions within industrial operations are identified. Based on literature review and expert interviews, a clear dependency between technological maturity and maintenance sustainability is identified. These findings provide decision-makers with valuable insights to navigate the complex technology landscape and implement evidence-based strategies to achieve both operational excellence and environmental responsibility.

AB  - Requirements engineering is a critical activity in developing complex cyber-physical systems. Requirements are usually expressed using natural language, which may be ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete. These issues in requirements qualities may introduce errors in system design that lead to high project cost overruns. Hence it is essential to verify the qualities of requirements early. Since formal methods have demonstrated their ability to verify system designs and are increasingly adopted to support requirements engineering for software systems, a question arises about adapting formal methods to account for specific properties of cyber-physical systems. Even if there are many literature reviews concerning requirements engineering, there is a lack of a global view on the reviews that specifically address the issues related to validation and verification (V&V) of requirements. This paper aims to provide an overview of literature reviews related to requirements V&V and mainly investigates the use of formal approaches and models for preventing, detecting, or correcting errors occurring in requirements and identifies the main challenges of adopting formal methods on requirements engineering for cyber-physical systems.

AB  - Energy saving remains a pivotal aspect of the global sustainable energy outlook, with primary strategies including energy efficiency (EE) and energy conservation (EC). Although energy efficiency often receives more attention, this study emphasizes the equally critical role of energy conservation. Utilizing the PRISMA-2020 methodology, our research systematically delves into the landscape of energy saving, discerning between the coverage of EE and EC. Our analysis of 329 studies reveals a significant imbalance, with 292 (88.8%) focused on EE and only 37 (11.2%) on EC. This systematic review specifically targets these 37 EC-focused studies to map out current research trajectories, identify critical gaps, and propose actionable pathways for future research. Key findings highlight the lack of empirical field validation and demographic inclusivity in study designs, suggesting areas ripe for further exploration. Specifically, our study calls for increased empirical validation of energy conservation strategies across diverse demographic settings and stresses the importance of integrating real-world applications to verify theoretical models. Furthermore, we underscore the necessity of policy interventions and behavioral research to develop comprehensive energy conservation strategies that support global sustainable development goals (SDGs). The outlined pathways aim to guide researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to prioritize and strategize future research, thereby maximizing the impact of energy conservation initiatives worldwide and fostering broader environmental stewardship.

AB  - The pressing global issues of climate change and energy sustainability underscore the need to integrate renewable technologies into building designs. Solar Photovoltaic Systems (SPVS) and Passive Houses (PHs) stand out, offering substantial potential to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency. This study investigates the integration of SPVS into PHs, focusing on global adoption trends, influencing factors, and key design considerations. Data was gathered using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, which led to the final inclusion of 32 articles for this study published between 2012 and 2024. The analysis identified three key adoption trends: project type, geographic distribution, and growth rate. It also identified 18 drivers, nine barriers, and two design considerations pivotal to SPVS-PH adoption. The findings led to the development of a conceptual framework to guide stakeholders, including policymakers, homeowners, and building professionals, in facilitating SPVS-PH adoption. This framework supports global carbon reduction efforts and promotes sustainable practices by addressing barriers and leveraging identified drivers. The study provides actionable insights into enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability in the built environment.

AB  - Tile drainage increases agricultural productivity and can significantly alter downstream hydrology. A comprehensive understanding of tile drainage impacts on stream flashiness can inform tile drainage design and management at the watershed scale to balance agronomic benefits and potential impacts on watershed hydrology. We evaluated by meta-analysis the impact of tile drainage on downstream flashiness (Richards-Baker Index, RBI) for 464 rain-fed watersheds worldwide encompassing highly variable tile drainage extent and watershed characteristics, identified by systematic literature review and from USGS datasets. Watersheds were largely concentrated in North America (89.9 %), particularly the US Upper Midwest (77.4 %), and northern Europe (9.7 %). Stream flashiness was similar regardless of tile drainage extent. However, stream flashiness was higher in relatively flat (<2% slope) watersheds with medium (RBI 0.44) and high (RBI 0.37) tile drainage extent relative to low tile drainage extent (RBI 0.33) watersheds. For watersheds with slopes averaging >2 %, flashiness was greater for low tile drainage (RBI 0.49) than medium (RBI 0.25) or high (RBI 0.35) tile drainage. Watersheds with low infiltration soils exhibited 24 % greater flashiness for low (RBI 0.51) tile drainage extent than for high (RBI 0.41) tile drainage extent. In watersheds with soils of high infiltration rate, stream flashiness was similar across the low (RBI 0.28), medium (RBI 0.30), and high (RBI 0.29) tile drainage extents. By accounting for watershed characteristics of slope and soil infiltration, this work points to complex drivers of tile drainage outcomes for stream flashiness that can lead to opposite impacts of tile drainage on stream flashiness and thus preclude blanket conclusions of tiling effects on watershed hydrology. Additionally, we identify salient data gaps in tile system design and management (e.g., tile diameter, installation depth, and spacing) that must be resolved to enable more accurate assessments of context-specific tile drainage impacts on stream flashiness.

AB  - In the current era of sustainable energy and countries' efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to green transportation, lithium batteries have emerged as a promising means of meeting transportation requirements. Specifically, their high energy density makes them suitable for use in electric vehicles. These vehicles offer a way to comply with stringent regulations and reduce emissions. A lithium battery's efficacy and lifespan are significantly affected by temperature. In order to prioritize electric vehicle safety and reduce range anxiety, it is crucial to have a comprehensive comprehension of the current state as well as the ability to anticipate future developments and address issues related to battery thermal management systems (BTMS). A Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) that is optimally designed is essential for ensuring that Li-ion batteries operate properly within an ideal and safe temperature range. This system must effectively maintain a uniform temperature distribution across the cell, module, and battery pack's surface. This article begins with a bibliographic overview of research conducted on battery thermal management systems (BTMS). In particular, it emphasizes the significance of using phase change material (PCM)-based hybrid cooling systems. These types of hybrid systems have the potential to save energy without requiring moving elements and vehicle system power consumption. The paper then analyzes lithium-ion battery types, the processes of chemical reaction, the generation of electrical energy, and the mechanisms of heat generation within the battery. In addition, the impact of temperature on thermal phenomena in batteries, including thermal runaway and lithium dendrite, is examined. The study then provides a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the thermal management strategy in recent experimental, simulation, and modeling research within the organized category of BTMS for all-electric and hybrid vehicle battery packs. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each category of active and passive cooling methods, such as air, liquid, phase change material, heat pipe, thermoelectric, and refrigerant, were assessed. Then, research gaps were discussed, and prospective research directions, including passive-active hybrid techniques, were proposed.

AB  - Modern agriculture has been focused on optimizing production, neglecting supporting and regulating ecosystem services. Meta-analyses have demonstrated the potential of intercropping to deliver multiple ecosystem services. However, guidelines for the design and management of such systems remain unclear, especially for the understudied vegetable-based intercropping systems. Given the diversity of vegetable crops, we propose a ‘relay’ of classical crop-specific meta-analyses to capitalize on vegetable intercropping research. Each ‘leg’ in the relay analyzes the effects of companion crops on a focal crop, and over the course of subsequent legs, the network of interactions among the different crops is built. In this study we start what we aspire to be the meta-analysis relay, focusing on cabbage (Brassica oleracea ssp.) and the delivery of the provisioning services Productivity, Product Quality (grade and pest injury in cabbage products), and Yield Stability across different companion species, spatio-temporal configurations, and management practices. We identified 76 studies from all inhabited continents across 81 field sites, comprising 892 data records, of which 689 remained after cleaning. We show that intercropping reduced cabbage productivity (−7% on average, P < 0.05) but also pest injury (−48%, P < 0.001) relative to sole cabbage systems. Cabbage grade on the contrary was not significantly improved by intercropping (+1%, P = 0.71). Effects on yield stability varied widely as only few data records were available from trials conducted over more than two years, pointing to the need for longer-term experimentation. Greater productivity was associated with companion species with a low growth habit or types sown at or after planting of the cabbage crop thus limiting competition with cabbage at early development stages. The decrease in pest injuries was associated with intercropping patterns involving strong inter-plant interactions (i.e., mixed, row, and additive) and companion species that supported biodiversity such as living mulches. Overall, beneficial effects of intercropping tended to be more evident in organic production systems, possibly because synthetic inputs may have hidden regulating effects. Cabbage growers and agricultural advisors can use these guidelines when designing intercrop systems specific to their needs. Applying the approach to other crops and agro-ecosystem services as part of the proposed meta-analysis relay will foster comprehensive understanding of vegetable intercropping systems interactions.

AB  - Guided by a technological revolution, widely discussed paradigms as servitization and Circular Economy (CE) are progressively pushing manufacturers towards delivering increasingly complex solutions. Design plays a strategic role in this sense, either considering products, services or Product-Service Systems (PSSs). Concurrent engineering and, specifically, Design for X (DfX) approaches have been widely associated to products, revealing great potentialities for enhancing service functionalities like supportability and circularity. Again, DfX approaches have been already exploited to systematically support the PSS design process, given their re-known ability to allow a better information sharing between product designers and service managers. However, even if several DfX approaches related with the End of Life (EoL) stage already exist (e.g. Design for recycling, remanufacturing and EoL), they still need to better fit with a circular design perspective. Therefore, the aim of this paper is exploring and understanding how design can contribute towards a CE transition through the adoption of DfX approaches.

The focus on sustainability in the food and beverage (FoodBev) sector is a priority due to the close association and dependency on natural resources. The evolution of digitalization has accelerated sustainable development of the FoodBev sector and helped preserve sectorial natural resources dependencies. Digital skills are a key component of sustainable development, as skills are used to identify and implement sustainable solutions. Digitalization and the CE in the FoodBev sector are considered critical solutions for food waste and food loss, and potential drivers of sustainability. This study seeks to deploy a smart value chain tool for food waste and food loss management, and a digital mechanism for the sustainability of the FoodBev sector. The research team designs, develops, and demonstrates a python-enabled digital toolset, configured to construct a specific global search for sustainable alternates for waste and other streams of the FoodBev industry. The toolset adopts a combination of Artificial Intelligence techniques including data analytics and Natural Language Processing. The results provide for rapid technological alternatives identification for the sector. The paper provides technological alternatives for 18 FoodBev value streams.

AB  - Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technologies offer effective solutions to reduce the negative effects of crop pests while considering human and environmental health. However, disseminating these technologies faces several barriers, with one of the most significant being the lack of farmer awareness regarding their availability, deployment, and uptake. Digital tools are perceived as a new form of leverage for overcoming these barriers. This study analyzes current IPM digital tools and their potential to boost farmers’ awareness of the deployment and adoption of IPM technologies. From a software engineering perspective, this study aims to emphasize the critical functionalities and limitations of various IPM dissemination tools. It provides valuable insights to improve the adoption process and streamline the dissemination of IPM technologies. Through a systematic search in Google, Scopus and Web of Science for journal articles, over 32 dissemination tools were identified. The study thoroughly assesses these tools and identifies 5 main limitations hindering their regular use, especially in developing countries. Among the most significant limitations are the inadequate representation of tools developed in developing countries, lack of agroecological customization, and insufficient offline functionalities. Building on these findings, a user-centered design is employed to propose a software architecture for a novel Decision Support System (DSS) tailored to farmers and experts. The architecture comprises a local database for offline access, a mapping engine for data visualization, a conversation module with a triangulation engine for knowledge sharing, and an agroecology engine for technology recommendation based on an agroecological classification of the user’s landscape. Drawing from the review, identified limitations, and the proposed architecture, we illustrate how the resulting novel DSS is anticipated to improve the dissemination of IPM technologies.

AB  - Coffee is consumed worldwide, with its supply chain starting with coffee growers, who benefit least from it. Across its production, distribution, and commercialization processes, there are risks and issues that could damage the safety and authenticity of this product. Therefore, the coffee industry is looking for innovative technologies that allow traceability in the coffee supply chain. In this context, blockchain technology offers a promising solution as it supports traceability via a decentralized system that allows immutable records and transparent access; it also promotes collaborative work and removes intermediaries by generating trust between participants. This systematic literature review describes the state-of-the-art in research and development about the use of blockchain technology to improve traceability in the coffee supply chain. We also outline the open challenges that remain to be addressed in this field. We use the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to achieve this goal. Our findings suggest that the developments are mainly conceptual designs and prototypes, focusing on tracing products and verifying their authenticity using the Ethereum or Hyperledger blockchains. Also, our results show various challenges on the technology side, like efficiency improvements, integration with other technologies, infrastructure, and a lack of standards. There are also challenges at the management level, like the necessity of agreements for traceability processes, data governance, willingness to invest and pay, education, and support to deploy the technology on farms. After overcoming these open challenges, blockchain technology can improve traceability and increase value for stakeholders in the coffee supply chain.

AB  - Increasing use of renewable energy (RE) has raised awareness of energy storage technologies, with research focusing on developing vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) for large-scale storage due to their affordability, flexibility, and efficiency. This bibliometric study provides a general overview of research trends for electrolytes in VRFBs during the period from 2000 to 2024. The research field observed huge development with an expanding number of publications, heterogeneity of research themes, and increased international cooperation. Research was initially driven by fundamental electrochemical processes and efficiency in energy, whereas recent research was intended for performance optimization through the use of advanced materials and system design. Key advancements include membrane design to reduce ion crossover, the use of deep eutectic solvents, architected electrodes, and additive-improved electrolytes for improved thermal stability and robustness. Electrochemical diagnostics and imaging techniques have pushed redox kinetics and mass transport phenomena insight, and modeling approaches offer predictive insight into system function and failure mechanisms. Despite these breakthroughs, there remain long-standing challenges to overcome capacity fade, electrolyte degradation, and long-term stability in normal operating conditions. Future studies of VRFBs should be guided by the maximization of electrolyte composition and additive interactions for the minimization of side reactions like ion crossover and gas evolution. Integration of electrolyte design into system-level components will deliver improved stability and performance. Scalability and thermal stability can be realized through advanced modeling, low-cost materials, and multifunctional additives.

AB  - This review critically evaluates membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for greywater treatment, focusing on greywater characterization, MBR configurations, treatment processes, and reuse applications. MBR systems achieve high treatment efficiencies, with COD and TSS removal rates often exceeding 90% and 95%, respectively. The distinct characteristics of light and dark greywater, stemming from their varying pollutant loads, significantly influence MBR performance and must be considered during system design and operation. Most studies have been conducted at laboratory and pilot scales, with submerged and flat sheet membranes being the most commonly employed configurations. However, approximately 60% of the studies did not specify the membrane material, and 18% utilized PVDF membranes. Treatment-focused studies dominate the literature, while cost analyses and life cycle assessments (LCA) remain limited, revealing a significant gap in economic and environmental evaluations. Comparative analyses demonstrate that MBR systems outperform conventional methods, such as constructed wetlands and filtration, in terms of effluent quality and spatial efficiency. Pre-treatment processes, including sedimentation and fine filtration, are effective in mitigating membrane fouling, while post-treatment methods, such as UV disinfection and chlorination, ensure effluent suitability for reuse. Recent advancements, including gravity-driven MBRs, offer promising solutions for reducing energy consumption, making MBRs more suitable for decentralized applications. Reuse of treated greywater for irrigation, toilet flushing, and cleaning provides a sustainable approach to alleviate freshwater demand. However, further research is required to address operational challenges, optimize system performance, and develop regulatory frameworks that support the widespread implementation of greywater reuse with MBR technology.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis is a promising business model that pushes companies to move from linear production to a circular path. However, this transformation is complex because it requires companies to rethink and redesign their supply chains by considering the involvement of new stakeholders, the introduction of waste and their impact on product development, economic investments, and technological resources. As a result, companies need innovative modelling tools able to capture, investigate, and quantify the results of these changes and to work on the strategic planning, design, implementation, and management of their industrial symbiosis networks. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the most used modelling approaches to analyse industrial symbiosis, and to research their characteristics in terms of simulation methods, interaction mechanisms, and simulations software. Findings from our research suggest that an Agent-Based System Dynamics hybrid approach is an appropriate method for industrial symbiosis design and analysis. The paper also presents a theoretical framework that aims at supporting researchers and practitioners approaching industrial symbiosis and, in conclusion, a research agenda is suggested for scholars.

AB  - This study assessed the potential for minimizing human excreta bound phosphorus (P) loss through used disposable baby nappies, an area that remained unexplored for nations. Accordingly, it performed a substance flow analysis to assess the national P loss through used disposable baby nappies in the case of Australia. The analysis revealed that approximately 308 tonne P is lost through used baby nappies to landfills in Australia in 2019, which is nearly 2.5% of the overall P excreta as human waste. Although the quantity seems small in percentage term, it could result in the loss of a significant amount of P over several years, as assessed 5452 tonne P over the 2001–2019 period, which is concerning in the context of anticipated future global P scarcity. The review of peer-reviewed literature on available technologies/methods for recycling disposable baby nappy waste indicates that there are some technologies for recycling P particularly through co-composting with food and other organic wastes, while the majority of these are still at the lab/pilot scale. There are also various recycling techniques with purpose ranging from energy recovery to volume reduction, generation of pulp, hydrogel, cellulose, and polymer as well as to increase yield stress and viscosity of concrete, however, these are not effective in P recovery. The study implies that compost made of nappy waste can be used as fertilizer to produce bamboo, cotton, and maize plants to supply raw materials for producing biodegradable nappies, hence, to close the loop. The various product and system design options e.g., designing for flushing, designing for disassembling the excreta containing part, and designing for community composting suggested in this study could be further researched for identifying best suitable option to achieve P circular economy of disposable baby nappies. This study also recommends necessary interventions at various stages of the nappy life cycle to ensure sustainable management of phosphorus.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the depletion of fossil fuel reserves has significantly reduced global energy supplies, prompting a shift toward affordable, sustainable, renewable, and alternative energy sources like hydrogen (H2). H2, with its high energy content of 122 kJ/g, carbon-neutral generation, and minimal CO2 emissions (<1 kg CO2 per kg H2 with renewable pathways) stands out as a clean and potent energy source. Recently, advance green techniques for biohydrogen (BioH2) production, such as biological, thermochemical, electrochemical, and photocatalytic methods, have gained considerable attention due to their potential for sustainability and efficiency. Studies suggest that photofermentation can achieve yields of up to 3.5 mol H2/mol substrate, while dark fermentation yields range between 1.5 and 2.5 mol H2/mol substrate, depending on the feedstocks and operating conditions. Furthermore, all these green technologies effectively utilize waste or low-value materials, establishing a promising waste-to-energy nexus that enhances waste management and mitigates environmental concerns by adhering to the principles of Reuse, Reduce, Recycle, Recovery, and Reclamation (5Rs). Their cost-effectiveness and user-friendly nature facilitate the transition from a linear to a circular economy model, promoting sustainable development and long-term energy resilience. Hence, this paper explores the potential of BioH2 as a sustainable transportation fuel within the circular economy framework. The challenges related to BioH2 production, storage, transportation, and implementation are critically analyzed, highlighting its role in a circular economy to reduce carbon emissions, enhance resource efficiency, and promote sustainable energy. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations and regulatory frameworks necessary to support the adoption of BioH2 as a transportation fuel, emphasizing its potential to drive the transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future.

AB  - Purpose
Although there is a growing number of evidence-based interventions in child welfare, their outcomes are impacted by the level of implementation fidelity. Research demonstrates that it is vital to understand the type and degree of adaptations and modifications made during implementation. This narrative review examined articles where child welfare practitioners implemented an intervention. It analysed how practitioners modified the intervention, their reasons for the modification, and the effects on fidelity. Understanding the commonalities and reasons for these modifications will enhance the likelihood of successful implementation in child welfare systems.
Design and methods
A systematic search was conducted using the Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ASSIA), ERIC, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Social Science Database, and Social Services Abstracts electronic databases. The search was limited to qualitative and mixed-methods journal articles in the English language. The search terms were “evidence-based”, “evidence-informed”, “research informed”, “empirically supported”, “evidence-supported” and “implement”, with derivations such as implementation, and “child protection”, “child welfare”, or “protective services”. Studies were included if their focus was on practitioners implementing an intervention in a child welfare setting. Studies were excluded if their focus was not on child welfare; if they were non-research articles, theses/dissertations, or interventional studies; or if the focus was not on the process of implementation. The data were extracted into a matrix based on the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded (FRAME).
Results
Seventeen articles based on 15 studies were reviewed. All the studies reported some form of modification to the intervention by practitioners. Two main categories of modifications were identified: those based on practitioners’ needs and those based on client needs. Practitioners were highly focused on enhancing the feasibility of interventions to help manage their large workloads. Practitioners also valued client relationships and prioritised those relationships over fidelity. Few interventions addressed the complex needs of child welfare clients, leading to further adaptation. Fidelity was most influenced by practitioners holding a conceptual understanding of the intervention and its core principles. These practitioners made thoughtful adaptations to enhance the intervention without affecting fidelity.
Practice implications
The findings showed clear gaps in research. Further research should report on practitioner modifications and measures of fidelity, study the minimum length of effectiveness for interventions, and focus on developing interventions that address multi-morbidity. Finally, the findings showed that the primary barriers for practitioners using interventions with fidelity were organisational barriers. Practitioners were unlikely to use interventions when balancing too many competing priorities.

This study aimed to examine the current state of research on omnichannel interaction services in health care with a focus on the benefits, challenges, and issues that health care institutions may encounter when adopting this strategy. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize the current state of research and provide a comprehensive overview of the field. The results of the review were used to perform a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of omnichannel services in health care and identify 5 key criteria that health care institutions should consider when implementing an omnichannel strategy. This study contributes to the field by offering an updated and comprehensive understanding of omnichannel interaction services in health care and provides valuable insights for health care providers considering this strategy. The ultimate goal of an omnichannel strategy in health care is to improve patient engagement, increase access to care, and reduce costs while improving communication and collaboration among health care providers. The successful implementation of this strategy requires a well-defined plan, robust technology, infrastructure, data analytics, capabilities, trained professionals, and a basic understanding of the communication channels among patients. The adoption of an omnichannel strategy in health care can lead to new business growth and increased patient engagement, but health care institutions must be properly aligned and patients must be prepared for its implementation.

AB  - Electronic systems are increasingly present in the healthcare system and are often related to improved medical care. However, the widespread use of these technologies ended up building a relationship of dependence that can disrupt the doctor–patient relationship. In this context, digital scribes are automated clinical documentation systems that capture the physician–patient conversation and then generate the documentation for the appointment, enabling the physician to engage with the patient entirely. We have performed a systematic literature review on intelligent solutions for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with automatic documentation during a medical interview. The scope included only original research on systems that could detect speech and transcribe it in a natural and structured fashion simultaneously with the doctor–patient interaction, excluding speech-to-text-only technologies. The search resulted in a total of 1995 titles, with eight articles remaining after filtering for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The intelligent models mainly consisted of an ASR system with natural language processing capability, a medical lexicon, and structured text output. None of the articles had a commercially available product at the time of the publication and reported limited real-life experience. So far, none of the applications has been prospectively validated and tested in large-scale clinical studies. Nonetheless, these first reports suggest that automatic speech recognition may be a valuable tool in the future to facilitate medical registration in a faster and more reliable manner. Improving transparency, accuracy, and empathy could drastically change how patients and doctors experience a medical visit. Unfortunately, clinical data on the usability and benefits of such applications is almost non-existent. We believe that future work in this area is necessary and needed.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death around the world, in which myocardial infarction (MI) is a precipitating event. However, current therapies do not adequately address the multiple dysregulated systems following MI. Consequently, recent studies have developed novel biologic delivery systems to more effectively address these maladies. This review utilizes a scientometric summary of the recent literature to identify trends among biologic delivery systems designed to treat MI. Emphasis is placed on sustained or targeted release of biologics (e.g. growth factors, nucleic acids, stem cells, chemokines) from common delivery systems (e.g. microparticles, nanocarriers, injectable hydrogels, implantable patches). We also evaluate biologic delivery system trends in the entire regenerative medicine field to identify emerging approaches that may translate to the treatment of MI. Future developments include immune system targeting through soluble factor or chemokine delivery, and the development of advanced delivery systems that facilitate the synergistic delivery of biologics.

AB  - The continuous software engineering paradigm is gaining popularity in modern development practices, where the interleaving of design and runtime activities is induced by the continuous evolution of software systems. In this context, performance assessment is not easy, but recent studies have shown that architectural models evolving with the software can support this goal. In this paper, we present a mapping study aimed at classifying existing scientific contributions that deal with the architectural support for performance-targeted continuous software engineering. We have applied the systematic mapping methodology to an initial set of 215 potentially relevant papers and selected 66 primary studies that we have analyzed to characterize and classify the current state of research. This classification helps to focus on the main aspects that are being considered in this domain and, mostly, on the emerging findings and implications for future research.

AB  - Lately, the technology has been developed quickly causing the appearance of smart software products in many domains such as agriculture which are designed to ease people’s work. Due to bad weather phenomena and growing demand for agricultural products, have started to appear a lot of greenhouses, where there is a strict control around each parameter, by sensors, contributing to the increase of the production. This paper presents a smart platform which helps farmers to efficiently manage their greenhouses and to interact with other farmers. We present the software architecture and each implemented service. We describe the general implementation details and then we present the data gathering algorithm. This algorithm is one of the most important features of the platform because it deals with sending notifications to users in case of a problem in greenhouses. It also offers data for processing to other services like the statistics service. Performance tests show the necessary time for gathering a large amount of data and for their processing. In addition, we will analyze the time needed to send notifications to users.

AB  - Several types of accidents, such as exposure to toxic gases, fires, or explosions, are encountered in process industries which are highly risk systems. To reduce risks and the consequences of disruptive events, resilience is recognized as one of the most important aspects of safety management, and resilience assessment in complex process systems plays an important role. This study examines methods for resilience assessment in process industries, by reviewing the published studies. Given the transient changes in resilience and performance variability due to complexity, it is examined which methods are more commonly applied for quantitative resilience assessments. As a result of the review of published literature, the most commonly used method to assess resilience in process industries is Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). DBN may be used for the estimation of uncertainty and probability of resilience in chemical processes. The resilience of complex process systems, which consider some aspects of resilience like absorption, adaptation, and recovery, is addressed and modeled by DBN. This review provides information on the use of quantitative methods to assess the resilience of complex process systems, the estimation of failure probability, the determination of performance variability under complex conditions, and the model of interactions between the components of a complex process system.

AB  - Natural resources are limited and society has long been unwisely consuming them, while Earth has been longing for care. Most existing businesses are based on linear models and a transition to Circular Business Models is necessary. Circular Business Models are business models that enable systems that are regenerative by nature; they seek maintaining resource value at its maximum for as long as feasible, and eliminating or reducing resource leakage, by closing, slowing, or narrowing resource flows. For a transition to circular business models to happen, researchers and practitioners need to know how to implement and manage them. Therefore, this paper’s aim is threefold: (i) identify researchers, topics of highlight and journals housing research on Circular Business Models worldwide, (ii) identify the main aspects that influence Circular Business Model implementation, and (iii) point the unaddressed subjects in the existing literature on Circular Business Models. To that end, a systematic literature review was conducted. The EndNote, Microsoft Power BI, and the VOSviewer software tools were used to manage references and build visual maps, respectively. Resource flow management, considerations on surpluses, system orientation, challenges to circular business models, system design aspects, influence of company size, possible rebound effects, customer consideration, company’s culture and behavior, and capacity building for CE have been the main aspects of current concern on circular business model investigation. The importance of increasing circularity through circular business models is mainly addressed through the importance of top management support and its action from the company’s core to the outside. Further investigations and partnerships from theoreticians and practitioners are expected to assist the evolution of the theme.

AB  - Personalised Environmental Control Systems (PECS) enable occupants to locally adjust environmental parameters without affecting others. Rooted in the fields of thermal and air quality management, this approach is key for enhancing satisfaction and well-being in the built environment by empowering occupants to control their immediate surroundings. Moreover, it offers energy-saving potential by optimizing conditions in targeted areas rather than across the entire environment. Within the framework of the IEA EBC Annex 87, the concept was explored for the first time in the acoustic domain. After defining Acoustic PECS, a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines was conducted to unpack (1) technologies in the literature aligning with this concept; (2) their impact on occupants; and (3) current limitations. The literature search, conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, APA, and PubMed, included field or laboratory studies assessing systems enabling local acoustic control in settings that are relevant for office environments. Review papers, medical device studies, and reports without insights on occupant impact were excluded. Thirty-eight studies were selected, covering active and passive systems, building-attached, furniture-integrated, and wearable devices. The qualitative analysis highlighted potential positive effects in challenging acoustic environments, including reduced annoyance, improved work performance, masking or cancellation of intrusive noises, and enhancements in short-term memory, among other benefits, despite existing technological and methodological limitations. The evidence collected is constrained by the limited number of identified studies and methodological gaps stemming from the relatively wide focus of the studies where such devices were investigated. The definition of Acoustic PECS provides a foundation for future research, guiding the development of these systems and fostering high-quality and consistent evidence of their impacts.

AB  - This study evaluates the feasibility of an integrated liquid desiccant dehumidification system coupled with a heat pump, using CreCOPlus5100 (CCOP) as the working desiccant. The system, consisting of an internally-cooled dehumidifier and internally-heated regenerator without auxiliary coils, experimentally investigated. Under ASHRAE’s 0.4 % outdoor design conditions for Taiwan, numerical analyses were conducted to identify the feasible operating region, constrained by an outlet air dew point below 9 °C, a minimum local solution temperature above 15 °C, and a negative temperature difference between the solution inlet and outlet (ΔTsol). A one-dimensional model, framed as a two-point boundary value problem, was employed to explore performance across varied inlet conditions. Julia solvers demonstrated a substantial computational advantage, outperforming MATLAB and SciPy by factors of 40 and 800, respectively. Numerical results showed good agreement with experiments—within ±10 % for outlet dry bulb temperature and humidity ratio, and ±20 % for relative humidity. The effects of inlet solution temperature and mass fraction on feasibility were examined. CCOP exhibited favorable performance and corrosion resistance, outperforming CaCl2 and LiCl, which suffer from crystallization and regeneration issues. Conventionally, solution parameters were selected via trial-and-error and humidity equilibrium assumptions. This framework provides a more systematic insight into feasible operating zones and highlights scenarios requiring ancillary heating or cooling. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable to other configurations and climates, enabling broader application in system design and integration, particularly with Dedicated Outdoor Air Systems (DOAS) and Air Handling Units (AHUs).

AB  - Agricultural robots show a growing potential to improve resource management and reduce the environmental impacts of farming. However, the evaluation of robots’ contribution to support sustainable farming is still lacking. This study specifically reviewed the operationalization of four agroecological principles at the field level: recycling, soil health, biodiversity and synergy. To this aim, a scoping review was conducted on the Scopus database, with a query within titles, abstracts, and author keywords mentioning robots, and agroecology or sustainability. The body of literature was screened to include only open field robots. The resulting 78 documents were coded inductively on three macro areas: (1) academic background, (2) robot operations, (3) contribution to agroecology principles, whether explicitly or implicitly mentioned. The results highlight that robots operationalize agroecology principles through non-chemical and selective weeding to preserve diversity and soil health, lighter designs that reduce soil compaction, and advanced data collection systems to optimize resource use and synergy. Solar-powered robots represent early steps toward recycling, but this principle remains understudied. The discussion expands on the potential of robotics in other innovative approaches for sustainable agriculture, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and novel farming system design. Key challenges include ensuring farmers are enabled to master data collection and management, as well as integrating high-tech robotics with low-tech solutions. These efforts are critical for leveraging agricultural robotics to advance agroecology and sustainability across diverse farming systems.

AB  - General discussion around artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be mostly concerned about potential benefits or hazards. While AI excels in automating basic and simple repetitive tasks, this is not a synonym for creativity, nor ethically sustainable unless the role is simple. Machine learning, deep learning and AI are trendy phenomena. However, the ethicality and credibility of the usage of AI in Technology-assisted literature reviews are raising questions. A systematic literature review was conducted to the SCOPUS database and Google Search. The PRISMA framework was used for the literature review. It was explored how AI is used to conduct -or assist in literature reviews. The results indicate that different scientific fields discuss issues relating to biases in AI technology and there is no consensus about what keywords and definitions should be to describe the same issue. AI has its place in the methodology of literature reviews, and this methodology continues to develop, but there are unsolved issues that how to create a tool with minimal bias and understand the current limitations of the technology of artificial intelligence. The empirical observation is that there are no specified keywords for the articles which relate to artificial intelligence-assisted literature reviews, which creates limitations for the generalisability of the results of this systematic literature review. Thus, this study has made several basic discoveries during this systematic literature review and their results are discussed. AI still poses bias risk and AI assisted literature reviews cannot be reliable without human supervision and there is no consensus on how AI assisted literature reviews should be classified in keywords and titles. It remains an open question whether there are any more hidden qualitative hypotheses in the development of reliability and validity of AI technology, which are waiting for discovery.

AB  - Background
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for children and adolescents is a persuasive system that combines 3 major components to therapy—therapeutic content, technological features, and interactions between the user and program—intended to reduce users’ anxiety symptoms. Several reviews report the effectiveness of iCBT; however, iCBT design and delivery components differ widely across programs, which raise important questions about how iCBT effects are produced and can be optimized.
Objective
The objective of this study was to review and synthesize the iCBT literature using a realist approach with a persuasive systems perspective to (1) document the design and delivery components of iCBT and (2) generate hypotheses as to how these components may explain changes in anxiety symptoms after completing iCBT.
Methods
A multi-strategy search identified published and gray literature on iCBT for child and adolescent anxiety up until June 2019. Documents that met our prespecified inclusion criteria were appraised for relevance and methodological rigor. Data extraction was guided by the persuasive systems design (PSD) model. The model describes 28 technological design features, organized into 4 categories that help users meet their health goals: primary task support, dialogue support, system credibility support, and social support. We generated initial hypotheses for how PSD (mechanisms) and program delivery (context of use) features were linked to symptom changes (outcomes) across iCBT programs using realist and meta-ethnographic techniques. These hypothesized context-mechanism-outcome configurations were refined during analysis using evidence from the literature to improve their explanatory value.
Results
A total of 63 documents detailing 15 iCBT programs were included. A total of six iCBT programs were rated high for relevance, and most studies were of moderate-to-high methodological rigor. A total of 11 context-mechanism-outcome configurations (final hypotheses) were generated. Configurations primarily comprised PSD features from the primary task and dialogue support categories. Several key PSD features (eg, self-monitoring, simulation, social role, similarity, social learning, and rehearsal) were consistently reported in programs shown to reduce anxiety; many features were employed simultaneously, suggesting synergy when grouped. We also hypothesized the function of PSD features in generating iCBT impacts. Adjunct support was identified as an important aspect of context that may have complemented certain PSD features in reducing users’ anxiety.
Conclusions
This synthesis generated context-mechanism-outcome configurations (hypotheses) about the potential function, combination, and impact of iCBT program components thought to support desired program effects. We suggest that, when delivered with adjunct support, PSD features may contribute to reduced anxiety for child and adolescent users. Formal testing of the 11 configurations is required to confirm their impact on anxiety-based outcomes. From this we encourage a systematic and deliberate approach to iCBT design and evaluation to increase the pool of evidence-based interventions available to prevent and treat children and adolescents with anxiety.

AB  - Shape memory alloys (SMA) are materials with the fascinating characteristic of recovering apparent permanent deformations of 10% and more. Moreover, they are metals and exhibit the typical peculiarities of metals such as resistance, stiffness, and workability. The combination of these properties makes it easy to understand why these materials have experienced growing interest in the field of engineering and resulted in a new way of thinking about mechanical systems design. New perspectives have emerged and nonorthodox devices have started to become familiar in scientific circles. Overall, morphing wing concepts have acquired increasing consideration. In general, the possibility of envisaging large and sustainable structural deformations has opened the door to a breakthrough evolution in the standardized aspects of 20 century aircraft. Well before this, however, because some SMA also have the incredible property of being almost perfectly biocompatible, and because medical structural systems are usually simple, the field of health was where SMA started to become used extensively in the mechanical world. Aortic stents and orthodontic wires are still the most evident examples of their capabilities, and they can be said to have become part of everyday life. The fascinating story of SMA materials started almost by chance, as often happens for high-impact innovations. This chapter summarizes the most important steps in the discovery of this material, emphasizing what we can learn from experience.

AB  - Background
Over the past 2 decades, various desktop and mobile telemedicine systems have been developed to support communication and care coordination among distributed medical teams. However, in the hands-busy care environment, such technologies could become cumbersome because they require medical professionals to manually operate them. Smart glasses have been gaining momentum because of their advantages in enabling hands-free operation and see-what-I-see video-based consultation. Previous research has tested this novel technology in different health care settings.
Objective
The aim of this study was to review how smart glasses were designed, used, and evaluated as a telemedicine tool to support distributed care coordination and communication, as well as highlight the potential benefits and limitations regarding medical professionals’ use of smart glasses in practice.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in 6 databases that cover research within both health care and computer science domains. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology to review articles. A total of 5865 articles were retrieved and screened by 3 researchers, with 21 (0.36%) articles included for in-depth analysis.
Results
All of the reviewed articles (21/21, 100%) used off-the-shelf smart glass device and videoconferencing software, which had a high level of technology readiness for real-world use and deployment in care settings. The common system features used and evaluated in these studies included video and audio streaming, annotation, augmented reality, and hands-free interactions. These studies focused on evaluating the technical feasibility, effectiveness, and user experience of smart glasses. Although the smart glass technology has demonstrated numerous benefits and high levels of user acceptance, the reviewed studies noted a variety of barriers to successful adoption of this novel technology in actual care settings, including technical limitations, human factors and ergonomics, privacy and security issues, and organizational challenges.
Conclusions
User-centered system design, improved hardware performance, and software reliability are needed to realize the potential of smart glasses. More research is needed to examine and evaluate medical professionals’ needs, preferences, and perceptions, as well as elucidate how smart glasses affect the clinical workflow in complex care environments. Our findings inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of smart glasses that will improve organizational and patient outcomes.

AB  - Objective
To comprehensively and critically appraise the clinical benefits and engineering designs of functional electrical stimulation (FES)-rowing for management of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
Data Sources
Electronic database searches were conducted in Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica database, Emcare, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to May 12, 2020.
Study Selection
Search terms used were synonyms of “spinal cord injury” for Population and “Electric Stimulation (Therapy)/ and rowing” for Intervention. Two reviewers independently assessed articles based on the following inclusion criteria: recruited individuals with SCI; had aerobic FES-rowing exercise as study intervention; reported cardiovascular, muscular, bone mineral density, or metabolic outcomes; and examined engineering design of FES-rowing systems. Of the 256 titles that were retrieved in the primary search, 24 were included in this study.
Data Extraction
Study characteristics, quality, participants’ characteristics, test descriptions, and results were independently extracted by 2 reviewers. The quality of studies was assessed with the Downs and Black checklist.
Data Synthesis
Comparison of peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2peak) rates showed that V̇o2peak during FES-rowing was significantly higher than arm-only exercise; FES-rowing training improved V̇o2peak by 11.2% on average (95% confidence interval, 7.25-15.1), with a 4.1% (95% confidence interval, 2.23-5.97) increase in V̇o2peak per month of training. FES-rowing training reduced bone density loss with increased time postinjury. The rowing ergometer used in 2 studies provided motor assistance during rowing. Studies preferred manual stimulation control (n=20) over automatic (n=4).
Conclusions
Our results suggest FES-rowing is a viable exercise for individuals with SCI that can improve cardiovascular performance and reduce bone density loss. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand the optimal set-up for FES-rowing that maximizes the rehabilitation outcomes.

AB  - The digital thread (DT), a new paradigm for the development of complex engineering systems, has garnered widespread attention in recent years. The DT serves as a key driver and game-changer for the digital transformation of engineering systems due to its advantages in promoting the collaboration of stakeholders to aid decision-making. This study provides a systematic and quantitative survey of publications about the DT. By using bibliometric analysis tools, current progress on the DT in the engineering domain is visually identified. We analyzed the distribution of research teams, professional publishing sources, current research topics, and future research trends, revealing that current research of DT emphasizes the features of lifecycle, integration, interoperability, and decision-making inspired by the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (DIKW) model. Through a systematic review of relevant publications from the perspective of these key features, we propose an enabling framework of the DT, including the concept, reference architecture, and “3I” enabling technologies (integration; interoperability; and intelligent decision technologies). Finally, we outline the current challenges faced by the DT in the engineering domain, including issues about integration challenges, professional workforce, and cost analysis. This study aims to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the current states and research directions of the DT in the engineering domain.

AB  - Background
Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) play a pivotal role in health care by enhancing clinical decision-making processes. These systems represent a significant advancement in medical information systems. However, optimizing their effectiveness requires accounting for various human-computer interaction (HCI) elements that influence their functionality and user acceptance.
Objective
This study aimed to identify and categorize key HCI elements that impact CDSS performance to enhance system usability, adaptability, and decision-making accuracy.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review, identifying 923 studies from the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were screened and selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. A rigorous quality assessment process was applied to ensure the relevance and reliability of the included studies. Ultimately, of the 923 papers identified, 43 (4.7%) that specifically addressed HCI elements applicable to CDSS environments were included in the final analysis. Data extraction and synthesis were performed to answer the research questions regarding HCI elements.
Results
A total of 12 distinct HCI elements were identified, each with the potential to influence CDSS functionality. These elements align with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9241-11 framework, which defines usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. “User satisfaction,” “flexibility,” and “individuality” enhance satisfaction by improving system adaptability and user acceptance. “Visibility,” “explainability,” and “user control” strengthen effectiveness by supporting decision-making and error prevention. “Ease of use” improves efficiency by streamlining interactions and reducing cognitive load. Some elements influence effectiveness and efficiency, such as “data entry,” which ensures structured inputs for decision accuracy while optimizing workflows. Likewise, “alerts” provide timely information for effective decision-making and, simultaneously, are designed to avoid overwhelming users and maintain system efficiency. “Simplification” and “mental effort” also optimize workflows and reduce complexity. Furthermore, “interface” impacts effectiveness and efficiency by supporting accurate decision-making and streamlining user interaction. This categorization, aligned with ISO 9241-11, underscores the context and task dependency of usability, highlighting that HCI elements must be adapted to different user needs and environments for effective clinical decision-making.
Conclusions
This study addresses a critical gap in CDSS research by offering a comprehensive framework of HCI elements tailored to the CDSS environment. Incorporating these elements into system design can improve user satisfaction, reduce data errors, and enhance the accuracy of medical decisions. The findings lay the groundwork for future research, offering practical guidelines for developing more reliable and efficient CDSS systems in medical informatics fields.

AB  - In addressing fossil fuel supply concerns and their environmental impacts, the building sector, as a major energy consumer, offers an opportunity for renewable energy integration. Among renewable energy sources, solar energy through photovoltaic (PV) panels on building façades stands out as a notable option, though fully realizing their potential remains a challenge. This study introduces a framework for the automated design of PV panels integrated into the façades of existing buildings, enabling thorough assessment based on energy efficiency, economic feasibility, and environmental impact. The process involves capturing the geometry of building envelopes, a deep learning model to identify façade surfaces for PV installation, and simulations to model PV generation and energy demand. An evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm is then employed to determine the PV system design parameters. The results of applying the framework to two university buildings in Alberta, Canada, are presented. For these cases, when equal weights are given to economic, environmental, and energy efficiency objectives, the optimal PV layout can achieve electricity self-sufficiency of 5.16 % and 6.78 %, with greenhouse gas emission rates of 18.26 and 15.69 g CO2-eq./kWh, respectively. The analysis illustrates that adjusting objective priorities yields different optimized solutions to balance competing factors. For example, prioritizing self-sufficiency increases the number of panels while focusing on financial return results in fewer panels and shorter payback periods. Although the financial feasibility of PV systems in Alberta's energy market is currently constrained by low electricity prices, the analysis highlights opportunities for improvement through government incentives and potential electricity price increases.

AB  - Circular procurement (CP) represents the complex process of acquiring and managing goods, services, and works in a manner that supports circular economy principles, emphasizing waste reduction, material reuse, and resource regeneration. As an emerging paradigm, its success is modulated by several stakeholders, requiring cross-functional collaboration and a clear understanding of each stakeholder's roles and capabilities that can effectively navigate its intricacies. In this paper, we identify crucial stakeholder roles under the new CP paradigm and consolidate interrelationships among stakeholder groups. Using MoSCoW prioritization by six CP experts, the study conceptualizes capabilities that induce collaboration between different stakeholder roles for effective CP implementation. The findings of the study reveal critical stakeholders at each phase of CP implementation based on their power, legitimacy, urgency. Government agencies, design teams, circular audit experts, and end-of-life management professionals are among the definitive stakeholders identified within the CP implementation process. In addition, their key collaborative capabilities for effective CP implementation were revealed as trust, coordination, decision-making power, technical knowledge, and information sharing capabilities. The study further identifies key areas to enhance collaboration for CP implementation among stakeholders, driving sustainable innovation and reducing environmental impacts. The findings and propositions provide decision support for practitioners and policy makers to enhance collaboration effectiveness, promote stakeholder satisfaction, and achieve successful sustainable outcomes.

AB  - Background:
Understanding dependencies within microservices is essential for maintaining and evolving scalable and efficient software architectures. Dependencies influence how changes in one microservice might propagate to other microservices. With the decentralized nature of microservices, these dependencies might not be explicit to developers and lead to unique challenges in modern software development environments.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to synthesize existing literature on microservice dependencies, identify the types of dependencies, and examine the strategies employed to manage and analyze these relationships. This effort aims to elucidate how dependencies affect microservice systems and to provide a comprehensive overview of dependency management within microservices.
Method:
We conducted a multivocal literature review, starting with an initial dataset of 1,733 papers from academic literature (white literature). This corpus was narrowed down through a rigorous filtering process to 45 key publications that address the identification, management, and impacts of dependencies in microservices. Additionally, we incorporated 926 articles from grey literature sources such as Google, Stack Overflow, and Stack Exchange, expanding the scope beyond traditional academic research. After the filtration process, 45 articles were fully synthesized to integrate practical insights and professional experiences into our review.
Results:
The review identifies several types of dependencies in microservice systems and synthesizes this information into a unified dependency taxonomy. This review highlights a range of approaches to dependency management, revealing a significant gap in systematic catering approaches to generate taxonomies for dependencies and the need for integrated management tools. The findings underscore the fragmented nature of existing dependency management practices and the potential for more holistic approaches.
Conclusion:
This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, outlining effective strategies and pointing out areas needing improvement in dependency management. By offering a structured overview of the topic, the study serves as a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the robustness and maintainability of microservices.

AB  - The widespread of Internet of Things (IoT) and the price reduction and ubiquity of telecommunications has led to the emergence of smart environments where devices are becoming increasingly smarter and everything is connected and from which society aims to benefit. The data obtained from IoT is rapidly processed in various domains for the achievement of smart cities and societies. However, in many cases, applications are not contextualized by using data from outside the domain but are only contextualized using data from the domain itself, missing the opportunity for further contextualization. The lack of common criteria for the integration of data from different application domains is one of the main reasons that significantly hinders the integration of third-party data into real-time processing and decision-making systems and thus, the context awareness of developed applications. Although the use of several taxonomies and ontologies for context awareness in various application domains have been proposed, in many cases they are highly domain specific and/or difficult to integrate with other systems, which makes it challenging to facilitate data sharing between different systems and their processing to achieve enhanced context awareness. We aim to contribute to the addressing of these limitations through a reusable and extensible multi-domain taxonomy targeted to collaborative IoT and smart environments, which is also automatically integrated into a software architecture with real-time complex event processing technologies. The proposed solution has been illustrated through a case study and performance tests have been carried out in different computing capacity scenarios, showing its feasibility and usefulness.

AB  - Intercropping is the simultaneous cultivation of plant species in the same field for a considerable proportion of their growing periods. Interest in intercropping for sustainable agriculture is on the rise and the number of scientific studies on intercropping is strongly increasing. Here we assess the current status of knowledge on factors that determine yield, yield stability and resource use efficiency of intercropping as compared to sole cropping. Distinguishing resource use into acquisition and conversion shows that intercrops are mainly improving acquisition rather than conversion efficiency. We also make an attempt to quantify the importance of reduced biotic stresses through pests, diseases, and weeds. We particularly focus on blank spots in the knowledge and possible bias in existing literature and ask which research approaches are needed to advance the field and pave the way for a wider usage of intercropping in modern sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Thermo-chemical thermal storage offers high energy density and appropriate temperature levels for solar heat applications. The water–zeolite working pair is promising for both residential and industrial use. This study investigates a full-scale zeolite–water thermal storage system comprising two adsorbent beds, each filled with 756 kg of dry zeolite 13X in an 8 m3 vacuum steam reactor. Hot water circulates through a multi-U-tube heat exchanger embedded in the zeolite bed, while steam condensation occurs an external heat exchanger connected to a phase-change reactor. Three complete charge–discharge cycles were performed under varying pressure and temperature conditions. The system showed consistent performance, with thermal storage efficiencies ranging from 35.6 % to 54.6 %. Volumetric energy storage densities varied between 19.7 and 50.1  kWh/m3, and gravimetric densities between 31.7 and 80.8 Wh/kg. The temperature–pressure trajectories followed the ideal cycle closely, confirming effective system design and control. These results confirm the feasibility of commercial-scale thermo-chemical storage using zeolite–water pairs. Key findings highlight a strong dependence of storage efficiency on regeneration pressure and temperature, and a repeatable performance across cycles, suggesting stable adsorption–desorption behavior over time.

AB  - Context
Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in the convergence of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although software systems in this domain have attracted researchers to develop a large body of knowledge on software architecture designs, there is no systematic analysis of this knowledge.
Objective
This study aims to identify and synthesise state-of-the-art architectural elements including the design patterns, styles, views, quality attributes, and evaluation methodologies in the convergence of cloud computing and IoT.
Method
We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for a detailed analysis of 82 primary studies of a total of 1618 studies.
Results
We extracted six architectural design patterns in this domain; among them, edge connectivity patterns stand out as the most popular choice. The service-oriented architecture is the most frequently applied style in this context. Among all applicable quality attributes, scalability, timeliness, and security were the most investigated quality attributes. In addition, we included nine cross analyses to address the relationship between architectural patterns, styles, views, and evaluation methodologies with respect to different quality attributes and application areas.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that research on software architectures in this domain is increasing. Although few studies were found in which industrial evaluations were presented, industry requires more scientific and empirically validated design frameworks to guide software engineering in this domain. This work provides an overview of the field while identifying areas for future research.

AB  - The automotive domain is living an extremely challenging historical moment shocked by many emerging business and technological needs. Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities.

AB  - Context:
Growth of the older adult population has led to an increasing interest in technology-supported aged care. However the area has some challenges such as lack of care givers and limitations in understanding the emotional, social, physical, and mental well-being needs of older adults. Furthermore, there is a gap in the understanding between younger developers and ageing people of their requirements from digital systems. Digital health can play an important role supporting older adults’ well-being, emotional requirements, and social needs.
Objective:
We carried out a systematic review of the literature on RE for older adult digital health software. This was necessary to show the representatives of the current stage of understanding the needs of older adults in aged care digital health.
Methods:
Using established guidelines we developed a protocol, followed by the systematic search of eight databases. This resulted in 69 primary studies of high relevance, which were subsequently subjected to data extraction, synthesis, and reporting.
Results:
This systematic literature review highlights key RE processes used in digital health software for older people. It explored the key features developed for many digital solutions, utilization of technology for older user well-being and care, and the evaluations of proposed solutions. The review also identified key limitations found in existing primary studies that inspire future research opportunities.
Conclusion:
Our results indicate that requirements gathering and understanding have a significant variation between different studies. The differences are in the quality, depth, and techniques adopted for requirement gathering and this reason for these differences is largely due to uneven adoption of RE methods.

AB  - In low-income countries, the livelihoods of smallholders are affected to different extent by multiple issues, such as food insecurity or low soil fertility, depending on their multiple assets and farming characteristics. In this study, we aim at assessing the current sustainability of households in Tanzania to suggest potential changes in farming system to increase the household́ sustainability. Household survey data from 891 households in two regions of Tanzania (dry Dodoma and humid Morogoro) were used to build composite sustainability indices representing the three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental and social), based on 46 basic indicators. Then, a household typology was developed through principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis of descriptive variables, and regression analysis linked the sustainability of farms with household characteristics. The analysis revealed significant differences in household types that relied on different livelihood strategies including particularly a “Gathering-based” type in Dodoma and two “Crop-based” types in both regions. These livelihoods significantly influenced the level of farming system sustainability. Particularly, the households in the “Gathering-based” type performed worst on all three pillars of sustainability. By examining the level of capitals from the different household types, we identified that the “Gathering-based” type and “Crop-based” types could improve their livelihood and be better off if they adopt various upgrading solutions. Such solutions include intercropping and optimised weeding to increase productivity and resource-use efficiency, for which these households have sufficient labour resources. Additionally, livestock rearing and use of fertilisers coupled with rainwater harvesting can increase soil fertility and water use efficiency, and hence food security, without compromising the environmental component of sustainability. To facilitate the adoption of these sustainable intensification options, agricultural policies and appropriate training need to be implemented to fit the local context and diversity of household types.

AB  - Ketoprofen (KET) is widely used orally to treat arthritis, but prolonged use leads to significant adverse effects. Although topical application presents a promising alternative, KET's effectiveness is constrained by its physicochemical properties and permeation profile. To enhance its effectiveness for cutaneous use, researchers have investigated the potential of nanocarriers. This scoping review investigates the potential of associating KET with nanocarriers to enhance its cutaneous delivery, addressing both therapeutic efficacy and safety. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, selecting 37 articles from an initial 388 records. The most frequently employed nanocarriers for loading KET were nanoparticles (n = 8/37), microemulsion (n = 7/37), and nanoemulsion (n = 6/37). Most studies focused on liquid (n = 18/37) and semisolid formulations (n = 16/37). Key findings demonstrate that nanocarriers significantly improve KET skin permeation, retention, and pharmacological efficacy compared to conventional formulations. Remarkably, lipid-based systems exhibited enhanced drug permeation and bioavailability, sustained release, and prolonged therapeutic effects. Polymer-based systems showed additional advantages, such as reduced skin irritation and controlled drug delivery to deeper skin layers. Despite promising results, most research remains preclinical, with limited clinical data. This review highlights the advantages of nanocarrier formulations for KET delivery. It identifies gaps in safety assessments and clinical validation, aiming to guide future research for effective cutaneous KET delivery systems.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the economics of an intercontinental green liquid hydrogen supply chain. The economics of the proposed supply chain is estimated based on the basic design of the export/import terminal and the tanker with the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). As the base case, the LCOH for a 120 tons/day Australia-Korea supply chain is estimated at 7.54 $/kg-H2. The most substantial costs are incurred during green hydrogen production and liquefaction at 3.96 and 1.41 $/kg-H2, respectively. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to consider variations in the levelized cost of electricity and the prices of key equipment in each system. The LCOH of the sensitivity analysis falls within a range of 4.69–10.16 $/kg-H2 in optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, the LCOH is presented with the decline of levelized cost of electricity over time and the variations in export countries.

AB  - The anticipated surge in hydrogen energy adoption underscores the pivotal role of social acceptance in determining the viability of hydrogen technologies (HTs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of acceptance research on HT, evaluating measurement tools and utilized models, identifying influencing factors, and analyzing academic discourse on HT diffusion. Drawing from 39 studies, it highlights key acceptance factors: trust, environmental attitudes, subjective knowledge, and perceived risks. Discourse analysis uncovers perceived barriers like trust deficits, infrastructural challenges, and financial constraints, while strategic considerations such as timing and transparency are identified as drivers. The findings emphasize an individual-centred perspective, heterogeneous operationalizations, and a lack of longitudinal studies. The authors propose increased downstream research, focusing on societal reactions to implemented technologies and considering both psychological and contextual factors. Adoption of multi-level and institutional perspectives is essential.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics research and implementation emerged in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to positively impact project efficiency and effectiveness concerns such as safety, productivity, and quality. This shift, however, warrants the need for ethical considerations of AI and robotics adoption due to its potential negative impacts on aspects such as job security, safety, and privacy. Nevertheless, this did not receive sufficient attention, particularly within the academic community. This research systematically reviews AI and robotics research through the lens of ethics in the AEC community for the past five years. It identifies nine key ethical issues namely job loss, data privacy, data security, data transparency, decision-making conflict, acceptance and trust, reliability and safety, fear of surveillance, and liability, by summarizing existing literature and filtering it further based on its AEC relevance. Furthermore, thirteen research topics along the process were identified based on existing AEC studies that had direct relevance to the theme of ethics in general and their parallels are further discussed. Finally, the current challenges and knowledge gaps are discussed and seven specific future research directions are recommended. This study not only signifies more stakeholder awareness of this important topic but also provides imminent steps towards safer and more efficient realization.

This in-depth literature review, which follows the PRISMA 2020 framework, examines how PDM is being implemented in several areas of the manufacturing industry, focusing on how it is taking advantage of technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The presented in-depth evaluation of the technological principles, implementation methods, economic consequences, and operational improvements based on academic and industrial sources and new innovations is performed. According to the studies, integrating CDM can significantly increase machine uptime and reliability while reducing maintenance costs. In addition, the transition to PDM systems that use real-time data to predict faults and plan maintenance more accurately holds out promising prospects. However, there are still gaps in the overall methodologies for measuring the return on investment of PDM implementations, suggesting an essential research direction.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution considers data as a business asset and therefore this is placed as a central element of the software architecture (data as a service) that will support the horizontal and vertical digitalization of industrial processes. The large volume of data that the environment generates, its heterogeneity and complexity, as well as its reuse for later processes (e.g. analytics, IA) requires the adoption of policies, directives and standards for its right governance. Furthermore, the issues related to the use of resources in the cloud computing must be taken into account with the aim of meeting the requirements of performance and security of the different processes. This article, in the absence of frameworks adapted to this new architecture, proposes an initial schema for developing an effective data governance programme for third generation platforms, that means, a conceptual tool which guides organizations to define, design, develop and deploy services aligned with its vision and business goals in I4.0 era.

AB  - Direct photoelectrochemical water splitting using semiconductor materials is an attractive method for the generation of green hydrogen as a clean fuel, which is an essential piece in the puzzle of the sustainable energy transition. In this case, the semiconductor is in direct contact with the electrolyte solution implying stringent requirements on stability, but the advantages of simplicity make it an important focus of current research. The key to improving these solar energy conversion systems is associated with a good understanding of the performance-limiting processes, and, in this scenario, both steady-state photoelectrochemical methods and more advanced small-signal modulation techniques are needed to elucidate the relative importance of the wide variety of processes taking place simultaneously. This is particularly challenging for nanostructured and porous photoelectrodes, due to the potentially complicated potential distribution at the interface. This chapter focuses on the use of intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy to determine the competing effects of charge separation, bulk and interfacial recombination, and charge transfer to the solution for metal oxide photoanodes and photocathodes. The fundamental basis of the technique and current models are described in detail, and strategies to improve the performance are discussed. Examples of recent results on n-WO3 photoanodes are provided, with a specific emphasis on heterojunction systems designed to improve charge separation. Also, results for p-CuBi2O4 are described in detail: the influence of the film morphology is highlighted, and the effect of the use of alternative electron acceptors is illustrated. The chapter closes with conclusions on the promise of metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrodes and a brief description of the outlook for their use in direct photoelectrochemical water splitting systems.

AB  - Background
within challenging work environments, midwives and student midwives can experience both organisational and occupational sources of work-related psychological distress. As the wellbeing of healthcare staff directly correlates with the quality of maternity care, this distress must be met with adequate support provision. As such, the identification and appraisal of interventions designed to support midwives and student midwives in work-related psychological distress will be important in the pursuit of excellence in maternity care.
Objectives
to identify interventions designed to support midwives and/or student midwives in work-related psychological distress, and explore any outcomes and experiences associated with their use. Data sources; study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions This systematic mixed-methods review examined 6 articles which identified interventions designed to support midwives and/or student midwives in work-related psychological distress, and reports both the outcomes and experiences associated with their use. All relevant papers published internationally from the year 2000 to 2016, which evaluated and identified targeted interventions were included.

the reporting of this review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of each study has been appraised using a scoring system designed for appraising mixed-methods research, and concomitantly appraising qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods primary studies in mixed reviews. Bias has been assessed using an assessment of methodological rigor tool. Whilst taking a segregated systematic mixed-methods review approach, findings have been synthesised narratively.
Findings
this review identified mindfulness interventions, work-based resilience workshops partnered with a mentoring programme and the provision of clinical supervision, each reported to provide a variety of both personal and professional positive outcomes and experiences for midwives and/or student midwives. However, some midwives and/or student midwives reported less favourable experiences, and some were unable to participate in the interventions as provided for practical reasons.
Limitations
eligible studies were few, were not of high quality and were limited to international findings within first world countries. Additionally, two of the papers included related to the same intervention. Due to a paucity of studies, this review could not perform sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, meta-analysis or meta-regression.
Conclusions and implications of key findings
there is a lack of evidence based interventions available to support both midwives and student midwives in work-related psychological distress. Available studies reported positive outcomes and experiences for the majority of participants. However, future intervention studies will need to ensure that they are flexible enough for midwives and student midwives to engage with. Future intervention research has the opportunity to progress towards more rigorous studies, particularly ones which include midwives and student midwives as solitary population samples

AB  - Innovations for a low-carbon economy and carbon neutrality are the focal points of technology development in the energy sector. This paper aims to investigate the progress of technology and advancements in the energy sector and the implications for Indonesia via two routes, viz., renewable energy and energy efficiency. The methodology employed in this research is divided into two parts. Firstly, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify prevalent research trends within the energy sector. Second, a case study method was performed to gain a comprehensive understanding of energy transformation within the electricity and steel sectors. The study presents two key findings. First, the energy sector has experienced significant technological disruption, providing the opportunity for Indonesia to transition towards a low-carbon development. This includes smart grids, energy-intensive industries, electric vehicles, and storage (pumped storage and battery). Second, lessons from the steel industry show that the technology selection is sensitive to parent company, and this is not easily captured in literature studies. Indonesian has gained many benefits from the global technological disruption, but this is not sufficient without developing changes in support system and consumer behavior.

AB  - Background
Speech disorders can significantly impact communication, social interaction, and overall quality of life, affecting individuals of all ages. Telespeech therapy has emerged as an innovative solution, leveraging technology to provide accessible and effective speech interventions remotely. This approach offers flexibility and convenience, addressing barriers such as geographical limitations and scheduling conflicts. This review aims to explore key interventions, applications, benefits, and challenges of telespeech therapy to enhance understanding of its potential in improving speech and language outcomes.
Methods
The scoping review was carried out in alignment with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Three electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Two authors independently screened and selected the studies.
Results
Of the 2,587 papers, 52 articles were included in our review. Telespeech was most commonly used for treating aphasia (n = 17), stuttering (n = 8), and Parkinson’s disease (n = 6). The primary interventions included videoconferencing (63 %), web-based platforms (24 %), and mobile applications (13 %), with most services delivered synchronously (63 %) and some asynchronously (37 %). The most common applications were “rehabilitation and treatment” (59 %) and “performance assessment of patients”(35 %). A total of 264 tele-speech benefits and challenges were identified and later consolidated into 40 items (26 benefits, 14 challenges). Key benefits included “reliable access to healthcare services and addressing disparities” (n = 26), “cost savings” (n = 23), and “improving patient outcomes and quality of care” (n = 21). Major challenges were “low-speed internet” (n = 13), “lack of technology skills” (n = 11), and “limited access to technology” (n = 8).
Conclusion
Telespeech therapy can be effectively integrated into routine practice, especially in underserved or remote areas. It offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for rehabilitation and performance assessment, improving patient outcomes and addressing healthcare gaps. Continued technological advancements and targeted training can further enhance its benefits and effectiveness.

AB  - Increasing time and cost pressure are forcing companies to plan and design their manufacturing systems with fuzzy product data in order to keep pace with shorter and agile product development cycles. This development is accompanied by a multitude of requirements for the planning of the respective manufacturing equipment. Many of these requirements are associated with a high degree of uncertainty and can thus only be specified vaguely in early planning phases, eventually leading to costly, originally unforeseen changes to the specified type of equipment. This consequently underlines the need for a predictive evaluation of uncertainty, or changeability in this context, to enable a more efficient planning approach based on quantified levels of uncertainty. In this paper, the authors therefore present the results of a systematic literature review on the evaluation of changeability in manufacturing systems design with special focus on uncertainty. Most importantly, standardized methods are not available yet; hence, product development as well as project management approaches are frequently adapted to manufacturing systems design. Furthermore, FMEA and fuzzy-logic-based methods are promising techniques for the assessment of uncertainty as a key element of changeability. Concluding, the paper discusses how the findings could support the development of a holistic approach to identify and predictively evaluate uncertainty in order to use it as a decision-making factor for the application of agile planning methods, thus contributing to better decision-making and higher achievement levels of project targets in industrial practice.

AB  - There is a large body of research on the Internet of Things (IoT) utilization to achieve Thermal comfort while maintaining Energy efficiency (IoT-TE). This research offers insights to promote the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Based on the proposed hypothesis, IoT-TE research is highly relevant to SDG 7 and SDG 11. Therefore, this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of publications that support SDGs in IoT-TE. 873 articles from the Scopus database up to December 2023 were analyzed with its significant trends. A substantial portion of the citations focused on research published within the past ten years, reaching a notable peak in 2018 with an estimated 15,000 citations. IoT-TE research predominantly supported target was 7.3 Target (double the improvement in energy efficiency). This is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of IoT-TE literature supporting SDGs. The identified research gaps will influence IoT-TE research future directions and encourage cooperative research efforts. Furthermore, the research themes showed that energy efficiency is the forefront keyword of the current bibliometric research about IoT-TE. This study will help decision-makers and practitioners interested in SDGs understand the latest advances in research and achieve sustainability.

AB  - The emergence of IoT has propelled the traditionally known Product-Service System (PSS) to be characterized by smarter technologies, enabling them to collect and process data from the operational stage and facilitate communication between the customer and the provider. Commonly referred to as Smart Product-Service Systems (Smart PSS), these systems promise to create value at a personal level by collecting and effectively utilizing the operational data. However, one of the fundamental challenges is the lack of awareness as to what kind of data can be collected from the operational stage and what can be achieved from this data. This paper systematically reviews scientific literature to underline the kind of data being collected from the operational stage, the purposes being achieved from that data, and how they lead to value creation. The systematic review of 60 representative studies enabled the definition of the operational scenario that comprises 4 dimensions of data and 10 classes of data within these dimensions to generically identify what kind of data is being collected. The intend presented by various authors led to the generalization of 5 themes that target different purposes of collecting data. Further, the papers were classified with regards to functional or non-functional requirements to see how data in different approaches are leveraged for value creation. Finally, the discussion highlights the current gaps in the literature and raises several opportunities for future contributions.

AB  - With the growing need for sustainable energy solutions in urban areas, a strategic integration of energy supply, public transport modernization, and energy demand reduction for residential and commercial buildings has become crucial. While numerous efforts have showcased technological advancements and examined the functionality of energy systems, urban applications have not received adequate attention. To address this gap, this research proposes a feasibility analysis of hybrid energy systems in urban settings. The study incorporates a well-defined research purpose, a robust methodology, and a comprehensive approach to data collection, enabling a thorough investigation of technological, scientific, and industrial developments. There is a requirement for a total of 20,349 k Wh of energy per year in the study area, and it can be met with a PV array having a production capacity of 5591 k Wh per year and a capacity of 14,758 k Wh per year. It also explains that 27 % of the required energy can be harnessed from photovoltaics, and 73 % from a domestic diesel generator. The system emits 13,428 kg of Carbon dioxide (CO2), 33.4 kg of carbon monoxide (CO), 3.71 kg of unburned hydrocarbon, 2.52 kg of particulate matter, 26.7 kg of Sulphur dioxide, 298 kg of Nitrogen oxides. The study encompasses a comprehensive review of past, present, and future trends in energy system design, development, and implementation, providing valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers.

AB  - Within the water-energy-food nexus, desalination and refrigeration cogeneration systems are able to address pressing sustainable development goals. Such systems exploit the synergy between the two processes to yield mutual benefits. This review evaluates existing cogeneration studies to recommend promising research directions for sustainable development applications such as simultaneous freshwater production and cold storage refrigeration. Compared to recent reviews of combined desalination and cooling systems, the novelty of this review is in its focus on refrigeration temperatures suitable for fresh food storage (between 0–15 °C), differentiating hybrid systems as Integrated or Coupled, and highlighting the potential technical and economic synergies between refrigeration and desalination systems for sustainable development applications. The key aspects examined included (1) capacity of desalination and refrigeration, (2) source of water and potential contaminants, (3) system design and synergies, (4) efficiency of energy and material resources, and (5) integration with renewable energy sources. The primary synergy in integrated systems was the simultaneous low-temperature evaporation of water and chilling of a cooling fluid. In coupled systems, the synergy comes from the usage of waste heat from refrigeration systems to drive thermal desalination processes. Regarding performance, the systems with the highest water recovery rates and thermal desalination efficiencies are hybrid multiple effect distillation systems. Promising directions for future research include experimentally validating numerically derived inferences, achieving deeper heat integration to improve system efficiency, and developing passive measures such as indirect evaporative cooling for simultaneous dehumidification, cooling, and water production.

AB  - Digital product passports (DPP) aim to provide comprehensive information on products throughout their lifecycle, improving decision-making in Circular Economy (CE) strategies. Although Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) has outlined requirements for information, technical designs, and operation of DPPs, it does not specify the types of information required at each lifecycle stage or the solution components, which can impact DPP development. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and examined 25 DPP frameworks across different industries, focusing on four main areas: data carrier, data source, data security, and user access and verification. Findings show that QR codes and RFID tags are commonly used data carriers in the manufacturing and construction industries, and Blockchain technology is the most widely adopted solution for data security. Furthermore, we sorted the types, and suggested information stored in DPPs into four stages of the lifecycle. Our review highlights a lack of efforts to enable information updates during maintenance by third-party service providers in the product use phase after the DPP has been launched. In response, we propose a conceptual blockchain-based DPP framework that supports a dynamic information flow, allowing verified users (e.g., repairers) to update DPPs with necessary lifecycle information (e.g., maintenance details). Implications such as the security of data carrier and identifying critical data for DPP to avoid information overload need to be considered. Advancing DPP with artificial intelligence tools should be explored to predict and estimate the product health to enhance longevity.

AB  - Background
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is a persuasive system as its design combines therapeutic content, technological features, and interactions between the user and the program to reduce anxiety for children and adolescents. How iCBT is designed and delivered differs across programs. Although iCBT is considered an effective approach for treating child and adolescent anxiety, rates of program use (eg, module completion) are highly variable for reasons that are not clear. As the extent to which users complete a program can impact anxiety outcomes, understanding what iCBT design and delivery features improve program use is critical for optimizing treatment effects.
Objective
The objectives of this study were to use a realist synthesis approach to explore the design and delivery features of iCBT for children and adolescents with anxiety as described in the literature and to examine their relationship to program use outcomes.
Methods
A search of published and gray literature was conducted up to November 2017. Prespecified inclusion criteria identified research studies, study protocols, and program websites on iCBT for child and adolescent anxiety. Literature was critically appraised for relevance and methodological rigor. The persuasive systems design (PSD) model, a comprehensive framework for designing and evaluating persuasive systems, was used to guide data extraction. iCBT program features were grouped under 4 PSD categories—Primary task support, Dialogue support, System credibility support, and Social support. iCBT design (PSD Mechanisms) and delivery features (Context of use) were linked to program use (Outcomes) using meta-ethnographic methods; these relationships were described as Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations. For our configurations, we identified key PSD features and delivery contexts that generated moderate-to-high program use based on moderate-to-high quality evidence found across multiple iCBT programs.
Results
A total of 44 documents detailing 10 iCBT programs were included. Seven iCBT programs had at least one document that scored high for relevance; most studies were of moderate-to-high methodological rigor. We developed 5 configurations that highlighted 8 PSD features (Tailoring, Personalization [Primary task supports]; Rewards, Reminders, Social role [Dialogue supports]; and Trustworthiness, Expertise, Authority [System credibility supports]) associated with moderate-to-high program use. Important features of delivery Context were adjunct support (a face-to-face, Web- or email-based communications component) and whether programs targeted the prevention or treatment of anxiety. Incorporating multiple PSD features may have additive or synergistic effects on program use.
Conclusions
The Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations we developed suggest that, when delivered with adjunct support, certain PSD features contribute to moderate-to-high use of iCBT prevention and treatment programs for children and adolescents with anxiety. Standardization of the definition and measurement of program use, formal testing of individual and combined PSD features, and use of real-world design and testing methods are important next steps to improving how we develop and deliver increasingly useful treatments to target users.

AB  - Context:
The interest in the intersection between cloud computing and sustainability is naturally growing as the popularity of the former makes it in many cases the default model for delivering software functionalities to end users. Furthermore, software architecture offers a fundamental route to address sustainability, with the recent shift towards recognizing sustainability as a software quality.
Objective:
Approaching the intersection between sustainability and cloud computing from the perspective of the study of software architectures, in this work we aim to collect the data necessary for us to understand the relation between these two areas as reflected in the literature. Given the lack of suitable surveys for this purpose in this paper we report on our review of the relevant literature, designed to address the question of how architectural solutions specifically for the cloud are addressing sustainability.
Methods:
Following the steps prescribed by a well-known method for this purpose on running a systematic literature review, we answer our defined research questions using both (qualitative) analysis and synthesis of data.
Results:
As a result of the review process, we are able to identify 10 solution types, 8 recurring design decisions, 11 involved architectural entities, and 17 distinct perceptions of the cloud with respect to sustainability. The adoption of reusable architectural tactics and patterns has been observed to be less prevalent than anticipated. Furthermore, certain fundamental characteristics of cloud computing, including multi-tenancy, on-demand resource provisioning, and the pay-as-you-go model, have been identified across diverse cloud perceptions.
Conclusion:
Our findings point to the need for more systematic work required on developing architectural solutions specifically for cloud computing incorporating sustainability goals. We also suggest that achieving sustainability through cloud in software architecture may be feasible. Furthermore, we identify a persistent threat to further secondary studies on the same topic due to improper use of terms.

AB  - With the growing demand for hospital resources worldwide, healthcare facilities, including Emergency Departments (EDs), look for opportunities to enhance patient care efficiency and streamline healthcare processes. To achieve this, simulation techniques, including Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), started gaining awareness; however, little is known regarding their applications and integration with various optimization methods and scenario-generation techniques in EDs. To address this research gap, we used bibliometric analysis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to narrow the publications to 62 articles and conduct a comprehensive review. During the evaluation of each article, three dimensions, namely the area of application, outcomes, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), were reviewed to understand the development and implementation of simulation techniques in EDs. The results shed light on the vital impact of process and time variations on simulation quality and the importance of involving healthcare professionals in simulation validation and verification. Furthermore, this study provided a conceptual framework that identified gaps and solutions related to the model scopes, approaches, technologies, and implementation of the DES and ABS in EDs. These findings could prove useful for healthcare researchers, practitioners, and managers in advancing the future research directions of DES and ABS and practical implications in the decision-making process.

Despite the presence of electronic medical records systems, traditional paper-based methods are often used in many countries to document data and eliminate medical record deficiencies. These methods waste patient and hospital resources. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the traditional deficiency management system and determine the requirements of an electronic deficiency management system in settings that currently use paper records alongside electronic hospital information systems.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method study was performed in three phases. First, the traditional process of medical records deficiency management was qualitatively evaluated. Second, the accuracy of identifying deficiencies by the traditional and redesigned checklists was compared. Third, the requirements for an electronic deficiency management system were discussed in focus group sessions.
Findings
Problems in the traditional system include inadequate guidelines, incomplete procedures for evaluating sheets and subsequent delays in activities. Problems also included the omission of some vital data elements and a lack of feedback about the documentation deficiencies of each documenter. There was a significant difference between the mean number of deficiencies identified by traditional and redesigned checklists (p < 0.0001). The authors proposed an electronic deficiency management system based on redesigned checklists with improved functionalities such as discriminating deficiencies based on the documenter’s role, providing systematic feedback and generating automatic reports.
Originality/value
Previous studies only examined the positive effect of audit and feedback methods to enhance the documentation of data elements in electronic and paper medical records. The authors propose an electronic deficiency management system for medical records to solve those problems. Health-care policymakers, hospital managers and health information systems developers can use the proposed system to manage deficiencies and improve medical records documentation.

AB  - Energy system components like renewable energy technologies or electrolyzers are subject to decreasing investment costs driven by technological progress. Various methods have been developed in the literature to capture model-endogenous technological learning. This review demonstrates the non-linear relationship between investment costs and production volume, resulting in non-convex optimization problems and discuss concepts to account for technological progress. While iterative solution methods tend to find future energy system designs that rely on suboptimal technology mixes, exact solutions leading to global optimality are computationally demanding. Most studies omit important system aspects such as sector integration, or a detailed spatial, temporal, and technological resolution to maintain model solvability, which likewise distorts the impact of technological learning. This can be improved by the application of methods such as temporal or spatial aggregation, decomposition methods, or the clustering of technologies. This review reveals the potential of those methods and points out important considerations for integrating endogenous technological learning. We propose a more integrated approach to handle computational complexity when integrating technological learning, that aims to preserve the model's feasibility. Furthermore, we identify significant gaps in current modeling practices and suggest future research directions to enhance the accuracy and utility of energy system models.

AB  - The rapid expansion of intermittent energy production has created an increasing demand for system balancing through energy storage. However, many promising energy storage technologies remain immature, necessitating focused attention from both academia and industry. To effectively guide future research efforts, it is crucial to assess the current state of research: identifying the topics that are being studied, recognizing the gaps, and understanding the trends. In this context, this study conducts a systematic bibliometric analysis of five emerging and maturing energy storage technologies across two periods, 2013–2017 and 2018–2022. This analysis aims to examine the evolution of the research landscape and the respective roles of academia and industry. The technologies under investigation are: 1. gravity energy storage, 2. carbon dioxide energy storage, 3. isothermal compressed air energy storage, 4. supercritical compressed air energy storage, and 5. power-to-gas. The bibliometric analysis follows a four-step process for each technology. The first step involves selecting relevant search terms, followed by an examination of publication and patent trends in the second step. The third step presents a detailed bibliometric data analysis, and the final step includes bibliometric mapping, focusing on keyword co-occurrence and co-authorship networks. The findings indicate that these technologies exhibit relatively similar research trajectories as they mature. Notably, the influence of Chinese research institutions has significantly increased between the two examined periods. Regarding the roles of academia and industry, a general trend emerges showing a strengthening academic presence across the studied technologies. Another key observation is the relatively slow development of research networks for most technologies, with the exception of power-to-gas. Additionally, there is a clear need for more research focused on environmental and sustainability issues.
