AB  - Nanogenerators have attracted particular attention during the last decade. A nanogenerator harness mechanical or thermal energy to produce electricity without any need for battery. In this paper, general descriptions of different types of nanogenerators, including piezoelectric, triboelectric, and pyroelectric, are presented. Next, bibliometric analysis and unsupervised machine learning–based analysis (principle component analysis) are carried out to determine the trends in this field of science. The current developments and directions for technology commercialization are briefly discussed. Additionally, the output performance and environmental consequences of active materials used in nanogenerators are analyzed by principle component analysis. The analysis reveals China’s sensible investment in the nanogenerator field during the last five years. The number of articles published by Chinese scholars is over 1000 during 2015–2020 with a considerable distance from the USA. It is also deduced that European countries need to pay more attention to this field if they want to compete with the USA, China, and South Korea. Overall, due to the huge amount of waste thermal energy worldwide, more efforts and resources have to be focused and invested in developing pyroelectric nanogenerators. Moreover, there is a need to find low-cost materials having a favorable environmental profile to fabricate nanogenerators.

AB  - With development of society, energy needs and the warnings of global warming have become two main focuses in the considerable aspects of human life. Currently, researchers need to concentrate on applying innovative methods for controlling the growth of energy use. Besides improving the energy efficiency by reducing energy consumption, energy quality issues have become a key topic of interest. Energy quality management (EQM) is a technique that aims at optimally utilizing the exergy content of various energy sources. This chapter introduces EQM in a relative systematic scope. Firstly, this chapter provides a definition of “energy quality,” and then it makes an explanation about the concept of EQM. Subsequently, EQM is introduced in two application fields: built environment and energy conversion technology. In this part, five case studies are presented. A brief description of each is shown below: Case Study 1 Renewable energy source is unpredictable and highly depends on climatic conditions, thus energy system reliability needs to be considered for the renewable energy systems. This case study defines the system reliability as a constraint function. EQM is capable of guiding users to make optimizations for energy systems under the predefined constraint. Case Study 2 For this case study, EQM aims to explore the optimum energy system that contains solar technologies in order to identify the suitable solar energy utilization pattern for different district typologies. The optimum system is defined with minimum life cycle CO2 emissions and cost as well as maximum exergy efficiency (EE). Then, the effects of different solar energy parameters on the solar utilization patterns for these districts are investigated. Case Study 3 As an important means to realize the energetic complementarity and improve the efficiency of renewable resources, the stand-alone microgrid (SAMG) system gains attention increasingly, especially in islands and remote areas. As a testing study, EQM is proposed to formulate for medium voltage (MV) SAMG in the case. Case Study 4 For this case, EQM concepts are applied to an ejector refrigeration system (ERS) that uses natural refrigerant R600a as the working fluid and has 100 kW cooling capacity (CC). The system is investigated from thermodynamic and thermoeconomic perspectives. To take EQM for such a system, the objective function is defined as the sum of the costs of brine side fluids, electricity (EL), and costs related to capital investment and operation and maintenance expense. The pinch point temperatures in the three heat changers are considered as the decision variables, with two different economic scenarios imposed to the system. An iteration technique is employed to minimize the objective function. It shows that the optimized objective function is reduced by 8.1 and 7.5%, respectively, compared to the nonoptimized cases for the two scenarios. Case Study 5 In this case study, a new ejector refrigeration system (NERS) using zeotropic mixture is proposed. R32/R134a, R32/R152a, R134a/R142b, R152a/R142b, R290/R600a, and R600a/R600 are selected as the working fluids in the analysis. The comparison between this NERS and the conventional ejector refrigeration system (CERS) is made under the same operating condition. It is found that this new system has higher coefficient of performances (COPs) than the CERS. The effects of operating conditions and the composition on the performance of this new system are presented. EQM is carried out to study the loss within each component of the system. It is observed that the irreversibility in the EJ represents more than 50% of the total exergy loss. As the last part, a novel type of advanced EQM based on the conventional EQM is included. Also, an ERS is set as an example to explain how the advanced EQM works. The advanced EQM for an ERS might avoid 35% of the overall exergy destruction in the whole system. It can be regarded as a valuable supplement to the conventional EQM in future.

AB  - Introduction: The construction industry employs about 7% of global manpower and contributes about 6% to the global economy. However, statistics have depicted that the construction industry contributes significantly to workplace fatalities and injuries despite multiple interventions (including technological applications) implemented by governments and construction companies. Recently, immersive technologies as part of a suite of industry 4.0 technologies, have also strongly emerged as a viable pathway to help address poor construction occupational safety and health (OSH) performance. Method: With the aim of gaining a broad view of different construction OSH issues addressed using immersive technologies, a review on the application of immersive technologies for construction OSH management is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis of literature. This resulted in the evaluation of 117 relevant papers collected from three online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village). Results: The review revealed that literature have focused on the application of various immersive technologies for hazard identification and visualization, safety training, design for safety, risk perception, and assessment in various construction works. The review identified several limitations regarding the use of immersive technologies, which include the low level of adoption of the developed immersive technologies for OSH management by the construction industry, very limited research on the application of immersive technologies for health hazards, and limited focus on the comparison of the effectiveness of various immersive technologies for construction OSH management. Conclusions and Practical Applications: For future research, it is recommended to identify possible reasons for the low transition level from research to industry practice and proffer solutions to the identified issues. Another recommendation is the study of the effectiveness of the use of immersive technologies for addressing health hazards in comparison to the conventional methods.

AB  - Background
In North America, although pharmacists are obligated to ensure prescribed medications are appropriate, information about a patient’s reason for use is not a required component of a legal prescription. The benefits of prescribers including the reason for use on prescriptions is evident in the current literature. However, it is not standard practice to share this information with pharmacists.
Objective
Our aim was to characterize the research on how including the reason for use on a prescription impacts pharmacists.
Methods
We performed an interdisciplinary scoping review, searching literature in the fields of health care, informatics, and engineering. The following databases were searched between December 2018 and January 2019: PubMed, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), and EMBASE.
Results
A total of 3912 potentially relevant articles were identified, with 9 papers meeting the inclusion criteria. The studies used different terminology (eg, indication, reason for use) and a wide variety of study methodologies, including prospective and retrospective observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and qualitative interviews and focus groups. The results suggest that including the reason for use on a prescription can help the pharmacist catch more errors, reduce the need to contact prescribers, support patient counseling, impact communication, and improve patient safety. Reasons that may prevent prescribers from adding the reason for use information are concerns about workflow and patient privacy.
Conclusions
More research is needed to understand how the reason for use information should be provided to pharmacists. In the limited literature to date, there is a consensus that the addition of this information to prescriptions benefits patient safety and enables pharmacists to be more effective. Future research should use an implementation science or theory-based approach to improve prescriber buy-in and, consequently, adoption.

AB  - Global sustainable development faces several challenges in addressing the needs of a growing population. Regarding food industries, the heightening pressure to meet these needs has resulted in increased waste generation. Thus, recognising these wastes as valuable resources is crucial to integrating sustainable models into current production systems. For instance, the current 24 billion tons of nutrient-rich livestock wastewater (LW) generated yearly could be recovered and valorised via biological uptake through microalgal biomass. Microalgae-based livestock wastewater treatment (MbLWT) has emerged as an effective technology for nutrient recovery, specifically targeting carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. However, the viability and efficacy of these systems rely on the characteristics of LW, including organic matter and ammonium concentration, content of suspended solids, and microbial load. Thus, this systematic literature review aims to provide guidance towards implementing an integral MbLWT system for nutrient control and recovery, discussing several pre-treatments used in literature to overcome the challenges regarding LW as a suitable media for microalgae cultivation.

AB  - The light environment, a vital element of the built environment, profoundly influences occupants’ physical and mental well-being. Recent artificial intelligence advancements have given rise to the concept of smart lighting systems, which hold the potential to dynamically regulate indoor lighting to optimize visual and non-visual benefits. Existing research lacks an occupant-centric smart lighting indicator framework and fails to integrate advanced sensor technologies for indicator sensing, resulting in insufficient studies on intra-individual differences and a lack of foundational sensing systems. This paper reviews current research on occupant indicators in lighting systems and their sensing methods and significance. The occupant indicators can be divided into two categories: demand-side, which relates to visual and non-visual needs of occupants, and output decision, which relates to the required output of the lighting system. There are signals and sensors that can be shared among multiple indicators, with vision-based sensors and bioelectrical signals having the best universality. The study proposes a smart lighting indicator system framework that integrates occupant and environmental indicators, and further summarizes its current application approaches and potential future research directions. Future research should focus on the development of non-contact devices, such as vision-based sensors and nearable physiological signal sensors, addressing issues related to privacy and deployment convenience, while also validating their effectiveness in occupant indicator sensing.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) is a popular topic for governments and businesses around the world; yet, only a few comprehensive and economy-wide frameworks exist, and the consequences of the CE on economic systems stay unclear. With this systematic review, we put under scrutiny the existing contributions to Circular Economy (CE) that apply the Agent-based modelling methodology. There is an open gap in the CE literature regarding the use of ABM. The research question that guides this systematic review concerns the potential benefit of ABM for CE and how to use this methodology in the context of CE. We put in evidence three thematic areas, two agents and one process, namely producers, i.e. firms and industrial systems, consumers, i.e. households and waste disposal, and the diffusion of innovation. We infer that the former three thematic strands of literature can be further synthetized together to form a general model of the Circular Economy. This development is crucial to properly evaluate how the agent's heterogeneity affects the diffusion and the consequences of the adoption of CE practices on the economy. Research has widely applied ABM simulations to consider the impact of heterogeneity amongst individuals and their behavioural interactions on the evolution of complex systems, yet very little did it systematically about CE. Our results complement those of Computable General Equilibrium models. The review provides an interpretative framework, suggests valuable future research directions within the new comprehensive thematic area, and contributes to the theoretical and managerial discussion on agent-based modelling in the circular economy.

AB  - Background
The older adult population (65 years or older) in the United States is growing, and it is important for communities to consider ways to support the aging population. Patient portals and electronic personal health records (ePHRs) are technologies that could better serve populations with the highest health care needs, such as older adults.
Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the existing research landscape related to patient portal and ePHR use and experience among older adults and to understand the benefits and barriers to older adults’ use and adoption of patient portals and ePHRs.
Methods
We searched six pertinent bibliographic databases for papers, published from 2006 to 2016 and written in English, that focused on adults 60 years or older and their use of or experience with patient portals or ePHRs. We adapted preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to review papers based on exclusion and inclusion criteria. We then applied thematic analysis to identify key themes around use, experience, and adoption.
Results
We retrieved 199 papers after an initial screening and removal of duplicate papers. Then we applied an inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a final set of 17 papers that focused on 15 separate projects. The majority of papers described studies involving qualitative research, including interviews and focus groups. They looked at the experience and use of ePHRs and patient portals. Overall, we found 2 main barriers to use: (1) privacy and security and (2) access to and ability to use technology and the Internet. We found 2 facilitators: (1) technical assistance and (2) family and provider advice. We also reported on older adults’ experience, including satisfaction with the system and improvement of the quality of their health care. Several studies captured features that older adults wanted from these systems such as further assistance managing health-related tasks and contextual health advice and tips.
Conclusions
More research is needed to better understand the patient portal experience among older adults from initial use to adoption. There are also opportunities to explore the role of design in addressing barriers and supporting facilitators to patient portal and ePHR use. Finally, the future use of these systems by older adults should be anticipated and considered in the design process.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution is a global crisis, with toxic metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) posing severe risks to ecosystems, water security, and public health due to their persistence and bioaccumulative nature. Conventional remediation methods, including chemical precipitation, ion exchange, and electrochemical treatment, while widely employed, are limited by incomplete removal, secondary waste generation, and high operational costs. These challenges underscore the need for innovative solutions that are efficient, scalable, and environmentally sustainable. This review critically examines the evolution of heavy metal remediation strategies, highlighting the complementary roles of both conventional techniques and emerging technologies. Advanced adsorbents, such as graphene-based materials, MXenes, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), demonstrate remarkable adsorption capacities and tunable selectivity in laboratory settings, but their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term stability remain key challenges. Hybrid systems that integrate processes, such as adsorption-photocatalysis and membrane-adsorption, offer synergistic advantages, potentially overcoming the limitations of single-method approaches. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are enabling rapid material discovery, process optimization, and predictive modeling for complex treatment scenarios. By bridging conventional approaches with transformative innovations, this review presents a comprehensive framework for developing robust, scalable, and sustainable solutions to heavy metal contamination. The insights provided align with global goals for water quality, ecosystem preservation, and public health protection, offering a forward-looking perspective on next-generation environmental remediation.

AB  - The application of 3D printing technology in the wind energy sector has garnered considerable interest recently owing to its ability to curtail the waste of materials, reduce manufacturing costs, and enhance performance. Although previous studies have investigated the impact of 3D printing in various industries, there is still a notable knowledge gap regarding its potential role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically in the field of wind turbine technology. This study sheds light on 3D printing's potential to advance SDGs through a bibliometric analysis. It also aims to examine the materials and techniques employed in 3D printing technology for wind energy applications and evaluate the extent to which SDGs have been integrated into the existing literature. Based on the bibliometric analysis, the results indicated that SDG 7, which pertains to affordable and clean energy, has been the subject of the most extensive research in this particular domain, accounting for 58% of the total contributions related to the SDGs. This can be justified by the contribution of 3D printing to energy and emissions reductions, with 54.8% energy recovery. Additionally, the impact of wind turbine 3D printing on the SDGs was only noticeable for three other goals that are SDGs 8, 12, and 13, with percentages of 8%, 8%, and 9%, respectively. The impact of 3D printing was also clear on SDG 13, as it reduces CO2 emissions by ∼25% in comparison to conventional manufacturing technologies. On the other hand, the involvement of all remaining SDGs was insignificant where no goal accounted for more than 3%. This highlights the necessity for additional investigation in these domains to enhance the sustainability and social impacts of wind turbines produced through 3D printing.

AB  - Gender-based Violence Exposure (GVE) is not usually a punctual event in a child's life. However, research into the differential adjustment related to the frequency of GVE is still inconclusive, especially regarding older children and adolescents, hindering the empirical integration and synthesis of this topic. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively synthesize the documented relationship between the frequency of exposure to GBV and adolescents' adjustment. We analyzed whether the relationships differed by sex, age, study design, violence conceptualization, and measurements. A comprehensive search of online databases was conducted into peer-reviewed studies published between January 2000 and September 2020. The searches yielded an initial total of 4850 studies, after screening 35 independent samples, 16,291 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using multilevel meta-analytic models. Overall, our findings provide evidence of the existence of a dose-response relationship between exposure to GVE and adolescents' adjustment. This relationship was especially significant for aggressive behavior, antisocial behavior, and dating violence. These results highlight the need for early intervention programmes to avoid the consolidation and chronicity of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems, and the need for further research on the variables associated with the adolescent's adjustment.

Emergent behavior cannot be attributed to one individual system alone but arises in the interplay of various systems, components etc. Ensuring the correctness of emergent behavior is a well-known challenge that has been addressed by research in various subfields of software engineering.
Objective:
This paper aims at providing a unified view on the research activities conducted and research contributions made on verification and validation of emergent behavior.
Methods:
We have conducted a systematic mapping study on the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. We applied a combined search strategy using manual, database, and snowball search. In total we investigated 7211 papers, from these 168 relevant papers have been included and classified.
Results:
Results show an increasing interest in the topic of verification and validation of emergent behavior. As only little validation and evaluation research has been conducted, the field can be considered still immature. There exist different verification and validation techniques used in the various solution approaches such as model checking, simulation, or runtime monitoring. It stands out that even though research is published in different software engineering fields and subfields no verification or validation technique can be attributed solely to a single field.

AB  - The significance and advantages of utilizing renewable energy sources are widely recognized. Upon examining past studies, it was revealed that there has been a lack of research on harnessing the waste energy from double-stage gas turbines powered by biomass-hydrogen hybrid fuel for polygeneration applications. Thus, a new configuration is proposed in the study for the multi-production of electricity, cooling, heating, and potable water. In the current research, a high-pressure turbine is driven by a combustion chamber fed by a biomass gasifier. Meanwhile, a low-pressure turbine is driven by a post-combustion chamber fed by hydrogen as fuel. The heat loss of the topping gas turbine cycle is recuperated by a supercritical Brayton cycle (SBC), a steam Rankine cycle (SRC), and a water heater. The waste heat of the supercritical Brayton cycle and steam Rankine cycle is recovered through an absorption refrigeration cycle and a thermoelectric generator, respectively. Thus, the heat loss of the topping system is completely recovered. The net power output of the gas turbine cycle is considered the electricity production of the system while the output power of the SBC and SRC is utilized in a reverse osmosis desalination system to produce potable water. The investigations conducted on the system are thermodynamic and exergy-economic assessments and three-objective optimization utilizing 5 gases (i.e., CO2, CO, Nitrogen, Air, and Helium) in the SBC. The final results reveal the superiority of Helium as the supercritical gas, bringing about an exergy efficiency (ηex) of 32.11 %, a total cost rate (C˙tot) of 103 $h−1, a payback period (PP) of 0.159 years, and a specific cost of polygeneration (cpoly) of 22.03 $GJ−1 for the system. Although the levelized cost of products of the configuration is high due to the freshwater production, ηex of the proposed system is higher than the previous systems based on a double-stage gas turbine cycle driven by biomass and hydrogen.

AB  - Solar home systems (SHSs) have seen rapid growth and have proven to be a viable source of electricity for households due to their capability to reach remote users that do not have access to grid systems. Based on a comprehensive literature review of 139 papers focussing on SHSs in Sub-Saharan Africa, this paper highlights the key trends, research gaps and policy recommendations. The literature was categorised into four themes: institutional, technology, viability and user-centric. The review finds that the current primary themes of research are technology, user-centric and viability. This highlights the need for further research into the institutional barriers of SHSs, as well as the regulatory frameworks and incentives needed to increase their adoption. The most popular topics discussed in the reviewed literature included SHS business models, SHS design, the energy demand of end-users and barriers to SHS adoption. The authors also identified paucity of research in countries with low electrification rates, highlighting new locations for SHS research.

AB  - Seamless integration between Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) plays an important role in the sustainable design and operation of buildings. This study explores the main causes of interoperability issues in the BIM-to-BEPS workflow, highlighting the limitations of the standardization framework and file-based data exchange methods. Analysis of domain-specific ISO standards showed that most focus on organizational processes and overlook semantic interoperability, which is essential for automated data exchange. An experimental evaluation of two BIM-to-BEPS workflows using Autodesk Revit, EnergyPlus, and TRNSYS further confirmed that even when open data standards such as IFC are used, translation errors in both geometry and semantics are common and require significant manual correction. The paper argues that reliance on file-based exchange creates barriers to interoperability and proposes a shift toward semantic web technologies, linked data, and API integration to better support the widespread adoption of Digital Twins.

AB  - The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy in the manufacturing sector requires prompt initiation. Establishing suitable production systems requirements during its design and development is, therefore, pivotal in ensuring the systems’ capabilities and alignment with circularity. Such effort will aid in enabling efficient and sustainable use during the operation of production systems, but also enabling a prolonged lifetime. Today’s requirement specification might not adhere to such effort, causing the design and development of production systems dedicated for single product variants and a given volume. This paper explores how requirement specifications are developed and used within manufacturing industry and specifically how circularity is supported. In the study, an interactive research approach has been adopted wherein several workshops with a large manufacturing company in the automotive industry have been conducted. The results involve the identification of three phases during the procurement of production systems wherein requirements are pivotal, namely the Request for information, Request for quotation, and internal evaluation. These phases are described in detail, and developed requirements are exemplified in order to provide insights into how to include circularity in each of the phases.

AB  - The increasing presence of pollutants in water bodies, coupled with growing industrial water demand, has accelerated water scarcity, which is projected to worsen by 2050. Additive manufacturing (AM) has recently emerged as a promising and innovative solution for water and wastewater treatment. This review explores various AM techniques that utilize liquid resin specifically for fabricating products aimed at treating water and wastewater. Various research studies were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar databases, with a time range from 2014 to 2025. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was adopted for selecting the studies; out of 552 studies, 223 were fully examined and used in this study, and the selected studies were determined based on its relevancy to wastewater treatments, resin-based AM, and how it is being utilized to remediate water pollutants. It also highlights recent advancements in 3D-printable resin-based functional materials for removing pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals, oil, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the integration of these 3D-printed structures with other chemical compounds to enhance their functionalities is discussed. While 3D-printed resin-based structures demonstrate significant versatility and effectiveness, the adoption of AM in wastewater treatment has lagged compared to other sectors due to various technical and environmental challenges. Key concerns include the potential leaching of toxic resin components into the environment and the scalability of AM-based treatment systems. Despite these issues, the ability to customise and functionalize resin materials offers promising avenues for creating multifunctional structures tailored for pollutant remediation. This review highlights not only the strengths of resin-based AM, particularly in enabling durable and adaptable designs, but also the pressing challenges that must be addressed. A balanced understanding of these factors is essential for optimizing resin-based AM techniques and accelerating their integration into sustainable water and wastewater treatment solutions.

AB  - The push for digitising personal health records needs to occur with serious consideration of privacy in order to instill public confidence. However, the healthcare sector still experiences leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) due to improper data protection practices and security failures by data custodians. Data minimisation refers to the practice of limiting personal data collection and usage to only what is required to fulfil a specific purpose, and is one of the directives in many privacy regulations and data protection acts. Blockchain technology provides a neutral third-party platform for healthcare applications on which trust can be built to increase confidence in all participating parties to create, store and share sensitive data. However, the aspects of design and implementation of data minimisation techniques within the blockchain context have not been systematically explored and no effort has been made to review and analyse the existing solutions so far. In this paper, we undertake a survey of data minimisation techniques in blockchain-based healthcare systems. We provide a broad definition of data minimisation and classify data minimisation approaches according to the different lifecycle phases of data processing workflows. We also present a comparative analysis on privacy properties achieved by these methods. This study offers a unique view of data minimisation from both data custodians and data owners’ viewpoints, and suggests several areas of future research and development to improve privacy in healthcare through data minimisation.

AB  - JThermodynamicsCloud, as its predecessors JThermodynamics, JTherGas and TherGas, use a dataset of fundamental data, such as Benson rules, the HBI method, symmetry corrections, steric corrections, ring strain and nearest neighbor interactions, to calculate the temperature dependent thermodynamics from 2D-graphical species representations of molecules and radical species needed for combustion modelling of (large) reaction mechanism, both hand and machine generated. JThermodynamicsCloud differs from previous versions in that it is cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) with improved data-management that promotes FAIR (that data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuseable) data practices and the concepts of data lineage and traceability. Of particular note is that all database updates can be traced to source data and different sets of fundamental data can be configured for the final calculation. The emphasis of this paper will be to describe the state of the art design features promoting data lineage, provenance, traceability, transparency, and FAIR data practices that make JThermodynamicsCloud a unique system for the management of (thermodynamic and chemical) data. The data, database structure, database organization, the use of ontologies and the concept of transactions will be described in the context of promoting state of the art database management practices. The techniques outlined here are particularly useful for calculations where several sets of information are combined to perform a calculation and where the data is continually being updated. The description of the specific group additivity thermodynamic calculations methods is left to previous papers. Though the system described involves the calculation of thermodynamic quantities, the data management principles and system structure described goes well beyond this case study and can be applied to a multitude of further applications.

KW  - India
AB  - The global discourse on climate change, emphasises the need for a rapid clean energy transition. National net-zero commitments are highly contingent on fossil fuel phaseout. India showed active leadership in the Glasgow Summit, 2021 by setting its Renewable Energy targets to 500 GW by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070. However, these entail major energy justice concerns as 80 % of India's electricity consumption is driven through fossil fuel sources. The phase-out of thermal power would hence pose risks to revenues, infrastructure, and employment. With costs and benefits of transition being unequally distributed, the social and economic burden is most likely to be shifted to rural populations, women, children, elderly, and vulnerable communities with weak agency to negotiate transition patterns. Thus, the question of ‘who benefits and how’ is central to India's energy transition story. Majority of the literature on energy justice emerges from the West and addresses questions of opportunities, challenges, economic implications, and policy, at the cost of exploring how justice concerns are embedded in transition dynamics. This study adopts a systematic approach to analyse energy transitions literature in the Indian context to identify how justice discourse interjects within this scholarship in terms of problematization and conceptualisation. In addition to exploring focus areas, methodological, geographical, and temporal trends, the study synthesises the literature to draw out major themes of enquiry. These themes are then analysed using the triumvirate lens of energy justice (distributive, recognition and procedural).

AB  - To achieve the sustainable development goals, there is a need to realize a green electromobility transition. Yet, this alone is not enough. There is also the question on how to manage end-of-life battery systems to reduce environmental pollution caused by improper disposal. A major challenge is battery disassembly, which precedes any reuse or recycling. If this disassembly is not cost-effective, cost-efficient, and scalable, the potential of electromobility will not realize or may even backfire. In response to this pressing issue, this study presents a systematic review of the literature on battery disassembly to summarize the state of art of the 43 papers identified, and to present a pathway for further developments of the field. Although the field evolved over the last years, many questions remain unanswered. Main issues are the automated disassembly of electric vehicle battery systems that can adapt to different variants, and the generation of data records for disassembly optimization using AI algorithms. This necessitates standardizing the design of electric vehicle battery systems and its process steps. Practical application trials can be conducted initially by providing data on the product life cycle of electric vehicle battery systems. In general, identified papers are less than expected. This raises the concern that research once again remains reactive instead of proactively finding solutions.

AB  - Maritime cybersecurity has emerged as a critical and rapidly evolving research field, necessitated by the increasing reliance on digital technologies and interconnectivity within the global maritime industry. In this paper, we adopt a bibliometric analysis method to review the existing academic publications pertaining to maritime cybersecurity, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the development status and research focus. The results show that: 1) Research on maritime cybersecurity is currently undergoing significant development; 2) Most articles on marine cybersecurity are published by researchers from North America and Europe, with most of them stem from the US, Norway, and UK; 3) Most international collaborations are limited at a regional level, and the major regions include North America and Europe; 4) Five closely related research keyword communities show that maritime cybersecurity research hotspots focus on transport-related cyber-attacks, autonomous vessel, AIS, maritime communication, and UAV. The above thorough examination of the current research on maritime cybersecurity also shows that there are some weaknesses in existing studies. For example, the research topic of maritime cybersecurity has not yet received adequate attention and the research hotspot is relatively concentrated. Based on the findings, we propose perspectives of the research on maritime cybersecurity from the aspects of the effectiveness of regulations, funding and investment opportunities, digitalization in the maritime industry and cybersecurity, advances in maritime communication systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles and maritime cybersecurity.

AB  - It is anticipated that the global community will encounter crises pertaining to water, energy, food, and the environment in the foreseeable future. The objective of this paper is to analyze global research endeavors pertaining to the interconnections among water, energy, food, and the environment. This paper presents critiques on the water–energy–food-environment nexus (WEFEN).Furthermore, this study analyses current innovations on the WEFEN nexus concept, applications, and impacts during the period of 2015–2023. Additionally, it aims to address the challenges and imperatives of investigating this nexus within the context of the world. This review critically analyzes the existing body of research pertaining to the interplay between water, energy, food, and the environment. Additionally, it highlights the challenges encountered in studying this intricate relationship and underscores the imperative for further investigation in this domain. This study reveals that the main barriers to achieving global integration of WEFEN are sector-specific policies and a dearth of integrated management approaches. Also named as big problems were the lack of money for projects that integrate WEFEN, the lack of information sources, and the lack of laws that cover the development of the WEFEN nexus as a whole. The findings of this study encompass recommendations for enhancing the interplay between WEFEN. These measures encompass enhancing collaboration and coordination among various entities, including governmental ministries, councils, universities, associations, and businesses. Additionally, establishing a dedicated policy-making institution and reaching a consensus on a comprehensive plan are crucial steps. By employing effective management strategies and formulating appropriate policies, the research and discoveries presented in this review article possess the potential to address the anticipated challenges that lie ahead for the global community.

AB  - Automation modifies workplaces, tools, and production activities, leading to new modalities of human-machine interaction. Traditionally, the allocation of functions in automated systems is static over time, i.e., functions are assigned to humans or machines. Adaptive Automation (AA) makes functions allocation dynamic, resulting from system conditions, performance, and human attributes to face emerging or unpredictable contingencies, and to cope with traditional automation challenges and limits. Tracing the evolutionary stages of the topic, the paper provides an extensive literature review. First, the review details the current definition of AA, the starting motivations for AA, and the temporal evolution of the topic considering the pioneers’ theories. Then, the paper presents the design elements involved in AA systems, i.e., the Level Of Automation (LOA), the Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), and the different approaches than can guide the adaptive shift. Finally, the practical applications of AA in manufacturing are reported. In such a way, the research offers the state of the art of the topic, providing the main distinguishing features between static and AA, also outlining the open challenges and the future developments in manufacturing.

AB  - This article explores the use of blockchain for agrobiodiversity (B4A) with a specific focus on (i) providing an overview of the existing regulatory challenges that result in sub-optimal research and innovation with agrobiodiversity conserved in situ, (ii) investigating how a blockchain-based solution may help overcome these challenges, and (iii) illustrating how incentive mechanisms can help to overcome shortcomings in existing intellectual property regimes that prevent effective conservation, research and innovation (CRI). Our research identifies (i) lack of channels for transparent and equitable sharing of know-how and materials (ii) lack of incentives, (iii) lack of trust among stakeholders, and (iv) lack of traceability options as main hindering reasons for in situ CRI with agrobiodiversity. Further, we find that blockchain solutions may empower data providers, including small farmers, to collectively track, control and monetize the use of data and assets shared while minimizing fraudulent activities. Transaction costs may also be lowered by removing complex and expensive interaction processes. However, further research and development are necessary to design an ethical and sustainable blockchain-based solution to incentivize in situ conservation, research and innovation with agrobiodiversity. Some future directions of research are recommended.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic and up-to-date review and classification of 91 studies on quantitative methods of green supply chains for sustainable inventory management. It particularly identifies the main study areas, findings and quantitative models by setting a point for future research opportunities in sustainable inventory management. It seeks to review the quantitative methods that can better contribute to deal with the environmental impact challenge. More specifically, it focuses on different supply chain designs (green supply chain, sustainable supply chain, reverse logistics, closed-loop supply chain) in a broader application context. It also identifies the most important variables and parameters in inventory modelling from a sustainable perspective. The paper also includes a comparative analysis of the different mathematical programming, simulation and statistical models, and their solution approach, with exact methods, simulation, heuristic or meta-heuristic solution algorithms, the last of which indicate the increasing attention paid by researchers in recent years. The main findings recognise mixed integer linear programming models supported by heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms as the most widely used modelling approach. Minimisation of costs and greenhouse gas emissions are the main objectives of the reviewed approaches, while social aspects are hardly addressed. The main contemplated inventory management parameters are holding costs, quantity to order, safety stock and backorders. Demand is the most frequently shared information. Finally, tactical decisions, as opposed to strategical and operational decisions, are the main ones.

AB  - Service-based business models have attracted growing interest as means to capture sustainable value. There is still unclear terminology and lack of understanding on how servitization can locate sustainability as central value. The purpose of this study is to consolidate the terminology and methods for servitization, to identify factors and elements that contribute to a sustainability perspective. The followed methodology includes a comprehensive literature review, further analyzed through a conceptual framework using an evidence-based approach. The findings of this study will clarify existing terminologies and frameworks while supporting the development of service-based business models that avoid the sustainability paradox of servitization.

AB  - Background
Ovarian cancer poses a significant and growing burden, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where incidence and mortality are projected to increase by over 50 % by 2050. However, there is a critical lack of qualitative data on the challenges and opportunities for improvement in treatment and care for women with ovarian cancer in these regions. The aim of this research is to investigate clinicians’ perspectives on the matter in 24 LMICs.
Methods
As part of the multi-country observational Every Woman Study™ (EWS), semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians between June 2022 and June 2023. The interview guide was developed by the EWS LMIC Oversight Committee, including patients, clinicians and data specialists. Relational content and inductive thematic analyses were employed and categories synthesized using the World Health Organization’s six building blocks of the Health Systems Framework.
Results
24 clinicians (54 % female; 79 % gynaecologic oncologists, 8 % gynaecologists, 8 % clinical oncologists not specializing in gynaecological cancers, and 4 % clinical oncologists specializing in gynaecological cancers; 42 % from Africa, 29 % from Asia, 29 % from Latin America) participated. Six dominant themes were identified: “Poor Ovarian Cancer Data'', “Inequity in Access to Treatment”, “In-Country Inequities in Access to Care”, “Role of Cultural Norms on Women's Health”, “Increased Engagement of Men in Ovarian Cancer Control”, and “Advocacy and Education for Empowering Women”. Content analysis revealed system-level challenges such as delayed drug payments, lack of population-based cancer data, and limited imaging facilities. Patient-level challenges included disparities in access to specialists, limited medication affordability, poor symptom recognition, and reliance on alternative treatments.
Conclusions and policy summary
This study reveals the complexity of ovarian cancer treatment and care in LMICs and the need to mitigate disparities in these regions, underscoring the need for patient-centred, context specific and intersectoral strategies to be considered in cancer planning to improve ovarian cancer care quality and equity in LMICs.

AB  - Water contamination caused by heavy metals, nutrients, and organic pollutants of varying particle sizes originating from domestic and industrial processes poses a significant global challenge. There is a growing concern, particularly regarding the presence of heavy metals in freshwater sources, as they can be toxic even at low concentrations, posing risks to human health and the environment. Currently, membrane technologies are recognized as effective and practical for treating domestic and industrial wastewater. However, these technologies are hindered by fouling issues. Furthermore, the utilization of conventional membranes leads to the accumulation of non-recyclable synthetic polymers, commonly used in their production, resulting in adverse environmental consequences. In light of our previously published studies on environmentally friendly, biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposite mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), we selected two top-performing PLA-based ultrafiltration nanocomposite membranes: one negatively charged (PLA-M−) and one positively charged (PLA-M+). We integrated these membranes into systems with varying arrangements to control fouling and eliminate heavy metals, organic pollutants, and nutrients from raw municipal wastewater collected by the local wastewater treatment plant in Abu Dhabi (UAE). The performance of two integrated systems (i.e., PLA-M+/PLA-M− and PLA-M−/PLA-M+) was compared in terms of permeate flux, contaminant removal efficiencies, and fouling mitigation. The PLA-M+/PLA-M− system achieved removal efficiencies of 79.6 %, 92.6 %, 88.7 %, 85.2 %, 98.9 %, 94 %, 83.3 %, and 98.3 % for chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate (NO3−-N), phosphate (PO43−-P), ammonium (NH4+-N), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu), respectively. On the other hand, the PLA-M−/PLA-M+ system recorded removal efficiencies of 85.8 %, 95.9 %, 100 %, 81.9 %, 99.3 %, 91.9 %, 72.9 %, and 98.9 % for COD, NO3−-N, PO43−-P, NH4+-N, Fe, Zn, Ni, and Cu, respectively. Notably, the PLA-M−/PLA-M+ system demonstrated superior antifouling resistance, making it the preferred integrated system. These findings demonstrate the potential of eco-friendly PLA nanocomposite UF-MMMs as a promising alternative to petroleum-based polymeric membranes for efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment.

KW  - Regulation
AB  - Under its proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (‘AIA’), the European Union seeks to develop harmonised standards involving abstract normative concepts such transparency, fairness, and accountability. Applying such concepts inevitably requires answering hard normative questions. Considering this challenge, we argue that there are three possible pathways for future standardisation under the AIA. First, European standard-setting organisations (‘SSOs’) could answer hard normative questions themselves. This approach would raise concerns about its democratic legitimacy. Standardisation is a technical discourse and tends to exclude non-expert stakeholders and the public at large. Second, instead of passing their own normative judgments, SSOs could track the normative consensus they find available. By analysing the standard-setting history of one major SSO, we show that such consensus tracking has historically been its pathway of choice. If standardisation under the AIA took the same route, we demonstrate how this would lead to a false sense of safety as the process is not infallible. Consensus tracking would furthermore push the need to solve unavoidable normative problems down the line. Instead of regulators, AI developers and/or users could define what, for example, fairness requires. By the institutional design of its AIA, the European Commission would have essentially kicked the ‘AI Ethics’ can down the road. We thus suggest a third pathway which aims to avoid the pitfalls of the previous two: SSOs should create standards which require “ethical disclosure by default”. These standards will specify minimum technical testing, documentation, and public reporting requirements to shift ethical decision-making to local stakeholders and limit provider discretion in answering hard normative questions in the development of AI products and services. Our proposed pathway is about putting the right information in the hands of the people with the legitimacy to make complex normative decisions at a local, context-sensitive level.

AB  - Background
Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can make patient care more efficient, cost-effective, and guideline-concordant. Many are created by clinicians who understand the challenges, but may publish concepts before considering subtle but important design details. Human-Centred Design (HCD) approaches provide necessary methods ensuring solid CDSS design. This article highlights HCD approaches in a pulmonary embolism CDSS case study context.
Methods
This pulmonary embolism CDSS results from collaborative work between computer science, psychology, and medicine. HCD methods used include: evaluations of pre-clinical prototype recordings, iterative usability expert reviews with software refinement, formative usability testing, and (separately-published) clinical pilot study.
Results
HCD methods were instrumental in iteratively creating an easy to use and functionally-sound CDSS. Retrospective evaluations revealed that participants spent considerable time on items that were out of order from natural cognitive diagnostic workflows. Features missing between original and study version were noted, confusing interface elements reworked, and currently-active decision tree branches were visually emphasized. From iterative usability reviews, positioning of information within the decision tree was radically reworked, information separated into levels of support for different user groups, and supportive versus directive language issues addressed. Formative studies identified issues such as interface adjustments and hospital workflow integration.
Conclusions
Human-centred design approaches provide methods for integrating the skills and knowledge of many disciplines, illustrated by example in this pulmonary embolism CDSS creation. Advantages of leveraging many design guidelines as well as revealing new design considerations that would otherwise have remained hidden are described. The findings reported here support future CDSS design through HCD inclusion.

AB  - Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are sustainable biotechnologies that have garnered global interest in recent decades. Since their inception, these systems have evolved through various configurations and modifications to enhance performance, prominently featuring microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Researchers are addressing the scaling challenges of MFCs with studies on algae-assisted MFCs (algae-MFCs), which simultaneously generate bioelectricity and treat wastewater cost-effectively. Algae-MFCs are carbon-neutral and photosynthesize to sequester CO2 while producing oxygen (O2) and biomass. O2 serves as an effective electron acceptor, and biomass is a biofuel feedstock, making the process economical and eco-friendly. This review highlights recent advances in algae-based MFCs, focusing on bioelectricity generation (up to 26,680 mW/m2) and biofuel outputs (200 mL/L/h of biohydrogen, 286 mL/g/VS of biomethane, 3.37 g/L of biobutanol, 73 g/L of bioethanol, and 121,104 kg/ha∙year of biodiesel), along with innovations in biokerosene (bio-jet) technology. The impacts of reactor components and configurations on algae-MFC performance, scaling strategies, real-time applications, and computational studies of algae-based BESs are also examined. Furthermore, this review assesses the technoeconomic viability, challenges, and future prospects of this technology. Overall, the findings suggest that algae-MFCs effectively remove contaminants from wastewater and increase power generation while also outlining directions for future advancements.

AB  - District heating and cooling systems have evolved through several development stages in order to improve their energy efficiency. The latest development reached the fifth generation where customers can be producers and/or consumers of thermal energy flows towards the network. The variety and complexity of system configurations and interactions between connected customers poses a challenge in adopting a suitable modeling paradigm capable of simulating each design case. Modelica language and the Functional Mock-up Interface standard are computational tools opted by the International Energy Agency for simulating building and community energy systems. This work aims to analyze the current status in literature where these tools are utilized in building and energy simulation with focus on district heating and cooling systems. Bibliographic maps and networks are presented to analyze the literature based on different bibliometrics. Among others, the analysis shows that coupled simulation between district and building energy models is a novel research area and can benefit in reducing the oversizing of space heating and cooling systems. In addition, the analysis demonstrates that the fifth generation district heating and cooling systems require advanced control strategies. These strategies need accurate and upfront specifications to decide a proper control strategy for each design case.

AB  - Bioretention systems have gained considerable popularity as a more natural approach to stormwater management in urban environments. The choice of bioretention media is frequently cited as one of the critical design parameters with the ultimate impact on the performance of the system. The goal of this review is to highlight data that challenge the importance of media as being the dominant design parameter and argue that the long-term performance is shaped by the interactions between media and the living components of a bioretention system, especially vegetation. Some of the key interactions are related to the impact of plant roots on media pore structure, which has implications on infiltration, storage capacity, and treatment. Another relevant interaction pertains to evapotranspiration and the associated impacts on the water balance and the water quality performance of bioretention systems. The impacts of vegetation on the media are highlighted and actual, as well as potential, impacts of plant-media interactions on bioretention performance are presented.

AB  - Electrical energy storage systems are becoming increasingly important in balancing and optimizing grid efficiency due to the growing penetration of renewable energy sources. Liquid air energy storage (LAES) is a promising technology recently proposed primarily for large-scale storage applications. It uses cryogen, or liquid air, as its energy vector. This study, for the first time, employed systematic, content, and bibliometric review approaches to provide an overview of the progress of research on LAES technology between 2000 and 2023. According to the study, cryogenic energy storage and liquefied gases research has evolved from foundational concepts to more advanced areas, focusing on improving energy efficiency, waste heat recovery, and system integration. Studies show significant improvements in round-trip efficiency, with some configurations achieving up to 70 % efficiencies. Integration with other technologies, such as natural gas power plants and renewable energy sources, has shown potential for cost-effective implementation. Experimental studies on cryogenic energy storage devices show high energy and exergy efficiencies, with cascaded packed beds promising for different temperature ranges. Heat recovery and utilization approaches improve round-trip efficiency, including organic rankine cycles and high-temperature heat pumps. The study concluded with some future research directions on the topic.

AB  - Supply chain and logistics management for spare parts is of key importance in the maritime industry, in order to ensure high availability and reliability of assets, while keeping operating costs in acceptable levels. Supply chain and logistics operations for spare parts incorporate high complexity, uncertainty and costs, due to special characteristics of the maritime sector, as for instance moving assets, globally scattered points of supply and demand, strict time windows and multi-actor setting. Typically, the asset owner purchases spare parts for their vessel from a foreign supplier, and consolidates them in a regional warehouse. Subsequently, these spare parts are shipped to a port using various means of transport such as air freight, sea freight or road freight. Finally, once the vessel calls at subject port, the spare parts are delivered and used on board for maintenance activities. For repairable items, the reverse logistics process also does exist; a spare part is offloaded from a vessel, repaired and then re-delivered on board. Efficiently handling such a logistics network constitutes a great challenge, nevertheless, this topic has received little attention in the literature and a systematic review is currently missing. In this paper, the authors attempt to address this research gap by performing a systematic literature review on spare parts supply chain and logistics management in the maritime sector. To achieve this objective, after applying the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria on the initial search results, a set of (30) eligible papers, participating in the review, has been identified. These selected papers are illustrated and discussed in detail, with the purpose of addressing the research questions initially set by the authors. Fundamentally, this study aims to describe the current state of the art in the subject area, identify existing challenges and trends, and finally provide suggestions on future research. We aspire that the results of this review can be used as the foundation for future research on spare parts supply chain management in the maritime sector.

KW  - HVAC
AB  - In healthcare buildings, precise thermal-humidity control is vital for infection prevention, but HVAC systems often rely on single-point sensors and uniform assumptions. However, actual indoor environments, such as hospital offices and support zones, often exhibit spatially uneven distributions of temperature and humidity, especially near ceiling regions—affecting thermal comfort, increasing mould risk, and degrading overall indoor air quality. Most existing data-driven models focus on temporal variations while overlooking spatial dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in identifying high-risk areas. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal prediction framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Transformers to forecast ceiling-level temperature and humidity dynamics in a hospital office environment. The framework employs graph-based methods to combine multi-source sensor data, extract spatial features, and model complex spatiotemporal interactions. In addition to empirical sensor measurements, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to validate the model, particularly in boundary and data-sparse regions. Compared to conventional deep learning models, the proposed GNN-Transformer demonstrates greater generalisability, especially in edge cases. For instance, at Point 1 –an area minimally affected by spatial disturbances—under a supply airflow of 3 m/s, the CNN-Transformer, based on a similar principle, exhibited humidity prediction errors (MSE and MAE) that were 5.0192 and 1.1531 points higher, respectively, than those of the GNN-Transformer. These results underscore the critical role of using GNN expression spatial correlations in indoor microenvironment modelling and offer valuable insights for improving HVAC control strategies and mould prevention in complex healthcare spaces.

AB  - Purpose
This paper aims to present key characteristics of educational design briefs for the circular economy (CE) through the analysis of 11 design briefs focussing on real-life challenges related to sustainability and the CE, developed with collaborating industry partners for four consecutive circular design internships conducted in Ireland, Catalunya, The Netherlands and Sweden.
Design/methodology/approach
These four internships were conducted between September 2017 and June 2019 and each internship lasted three to four months. The supervisors for each internship collaborated with local industry partners genuinely interested in adopting sustainable business practices to develop design briefs focussing on real-life challenges they face. The briefs for each internship were developed further according to the feedback of the interns, industry partners and supervisors of previous internships.
Findings
Five steps of brief making for circular design were identified as reviewing the existing resources, emphasizing the importance of systems thinking, emphasizing the importance of collaboration for the CE, focussing on circularity and communicating expectations. The paper outlines how design briefs changed throughout the consecutive internships according to the different curricula and the characteristics of an educational circular design brief.
Originality/value
For design educators and researchers, the value of this paper lies in presenting the steps for the brief making of educational circular design projects. Additionally, the characteristics of circular design briefs are outlined, discussing their focus and content to act as a guide for design educators.

AB  - Background
An adequate hospital foodservice is important to optimize protein and energy intake and to maintain or improve a patient’s nutritional status. Key elements that define an optimal foodservice have yet to be identified.
Objectives
To systematically describe the effects of published foodservice interventions on nutrition and clinical outcomes and determine which elements should be considered essential. Secondly, to describe the outcome measures used in these studies and evaluate their relevance and validity to guide future research.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science databases were searched. Studies that included assessment of nutrition and/or clinical outcomes of hospital foodservice up to December 2017 were eligible. The details of the subject population, the type of intervention, and the effects on reported outcomes were extracted from each study.
Results
In total, 33 studies that met inclusion criteria were identified, but only nine (27%) were rated as having sufficient methodologic quality. These nine studies concluded that various elements of a foodservice can be considered essential, including using volunteers to provide mealtime assistance, encouraging patients to choose protein-rich foods, adding protein-enriched items to the menu, replacing existing items with protein-enriched items, giving patients the ability to order food by telephone from a printed menu (room service concept), or a combination of these interventions. The interstudy heterogeneity was high for both outcome measures and methods.
Conclusions
Various foodservice interventions have the potential to improve outcome measures. Recommendations are made to facilitate future research.

AB  - Context:
Tertiary education institutions aim to prepare their computer science and software engineering students for working life. While much of the technical principles are covered in lower-level courses, team-based capstone courses are a common way to provide students with hands-on experience and teach soft skills.
Objective:
This paper explores the characteristics of project-based software engineering capstone courses presented in the literature. The goal of this work is to understand the pros and cons of different approaches by synthesising the various aspects of software engineering capstone courses and related experiences.
Method:
In a systematic literature review for 2007–2022, we identified 127 articles describing real-world capstone courses. These articles were analysed based on their presented course characteristics and the reported course outcomes.
Results:
The characteristics were synthesised into a taxonomy consisting of duration, team sizes, client and project sources, project implementation, and student assessment. We found out that capstone courses generally last one semester and divide students into groups of 4–5 where they work on a project for a client. For a slight majority of courses, the clients are external to the course staff and students are often expected to produce a proof-of-concept level software product as the main end deliverable. The courses generally include various forms of student assessment both during and at the end of the course.
Conclusions:
This paper provides researchers and educators with a classification of characteristics of software engineering capstone courses based on previous research. We also further synthesise insights on the reported course outcomes. Our review study aims to help educators to identify various ways of organising capstones and effectively plan and deliver their own capstone courses. The characterisation also helps researchers to conduct further studies on software engineering capstones.

AB  - Many modern consumer devices rely on network connections and cloud services to perform their core functions. This dependency is especially present in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which combine hardware and software with network connections (e.g., a ‘smart’ doorbell with a camera). This paper argues that current European product legislation, which aims to protect consumers of, inter alia, IoT devices, has a blind spot for an increasing problem in the competitive IoT market: manufacturer cessation. Without the manufacturer’s cloud servers, many IoT devices cannot perform core functions such as data analysis. If an IoT manufacturer ceases their operations, consumers of the manufacturer’s devices are thus often left with an obsolete device and, as the paper shows, hardly any legal remedies. This paper therefore investigates three properties that could support legislators in finding a solution for IoT manufacturer cessation: i) pre-emptive measures, aimed at ii) manufacturer-independent iii) collective control. The paper finally shows how these three properties already align with current legislative processes surrounding data portability, interoperability and open-source software development and analyses whether these processes can provide an adequate remedy for consumers.

AB  - Children in hospital are subjected to multiple negative stimuli that may hinder their development and social interactions. Although game technologies are thought to improve children’s experience in hospital, there is a lack of information on how they can be used effectively. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the existing approaches in this context to identify gaps for future research. A total of 1305 studies were identified, of which 75 were thoroughly analyzed according to our review protocol. The results show that the most common approach is to design mono-user games with traditional computers or monitor-based video consoles, which serve as a distractor or a motivator for physical rehabilitation for primary school children undergoing fearful procedures such as venipuncture, or those suffering chronic, neurological, or traumatic diseases/injures. We conclude that, on the one hand, game technologies seem to present physical and psychological benefits to pediatric patients, but more research is needed on this. On the other hand, future designers of games for pediatric hospitalization should consider: 1. The development for kindergarten patients and adolescents, 2. Address the psychological impact caused by long-term hospitalization, 3. Use collaboration as an effective game strategy to reduce patient isolation, 4. Have purposes other than distraction, such as socialization, coping with emotions, or fostering physical mobility, 5. Include parents/caregivers and hospital staff in the game activities; and 6. Exploit new technological artifacts such as robots and tangible interactive elements to encourage intrinsic motivation.

AB  - Production Planning and Control strategies have gained increasing importance in order to stay competitive by enhancing the ability to meet and quickly adapt to the requirements of highly volatile markets. In this context, traditional approaches like Material Requirements Planning often lead to long lead-times and high Work In Progress due to weak responsiveness to fluctuations in demand. New strategies and concepts in the era of Industry 4.0, like real-time data, have the potential to improve traditional approaches. The paper evaluates the impact of different levels of planning granularity of various Production Planning and Control strategies to improve the logistics performance in a Make-to-Order production system. The effects of a monthly, a two-week and a weekly planning horizon are evaluated according to a Material Requirement Planning, KANBAN and Constant Work In Progress strategy. The approach is validated by using a Discrete Event Simulation based on data from an electronics manufacturing company working in the Make to Order environment.

AB  - Space operations are inherently complex. By reviewing over thirty years of literature on risk, safety and reliability management in relation to satellites, this paper offers an extensive meta-analysis which aims at analysing the research field through meaningful arrangements of its key contributions. The analysis adopts a data mining perspective to review about 3900 documents through bibliometric indicators, i.e., citations and co-citations. Combining quantitative meta-analysis with Factor Analysis, this document aims to holistically summarize the main contributions in the field of risk, safety, and reliability in relation to satellites, in line with a multi-disciplinary perspective. Besides contributions about risk, safety and reliability per se (i.e., risk approaches related to the development and management of satellite), the field is largely concerned with risk, safety and reliability as products (i.e., the usage of satellite data to cope with a variety of risk and safety problems). On this path, especially about risk, safety and reliability per se area, this research suggests future research paths, implying an active collaboration between academia and industrial practice. Particular reference is devoted to the benefits of: (i) expanding space research with systematic and publicly shared repositories for reliability purposes, following large-scale examples from aviation, and a minor database about CubeSats; (ii) extending purely technological research focus with socio-technical aspects; (iii) considering the added value of a dedicated scientific source to collect and publish high-quality research in the field.

AB  - Engineering systems must function effectively whilst maintaining reliability in service. Predicting maintenance costs and asset availability raises varying degrees of uncertainty from multiple sources. Previous reviews in this domain have assessed cost uncertainty and estimation for the entire life cycle. This paper presents a systematic review to investigate existing methodologies and challenges in uncertainty quantification, aggregation and forecasting for modern engineering systems through their in-service life. Approaches to forecast uncertainty here are hindered chiefly by data quality of available data, experience and knowledge. A total of 107 papers were analysed to answer three research questions based on the scope, through which two core research gaps were identified. An integrated combination of identified approaches will enhance rigour in uncertainty assessment and forecasting. This review contributes a systematic identification and assessment of current practices in uncertainty quantification and scientific methodologies to quantify, aggregate and forecast quantitative and qualitative uncertainties to better understand their impact on cost and availability to aid decision making throughout the in-service phase.

AB  - The concept and design of ammonia as a marine fuel are still in the embryonic stage which requires an in-depth investigation of its applicability in terms of its safety and potential risks, both in the design and operational phases of a ship's lifecycle. The paper examines and compares the state-of-the-art safety regulations, rules, standards and guidelines relevant to ammonia-fuelled ships available in various classification societies reports and international regulations such as the IGF codes and summarises their gaps and limitations. The paper critically analyses three major hazards namely toxicity, chemical corrosion, fire and explosion and their potential impact on the human, environment and ship in the event of ammonia leakage. Various hazardous areas considered include ammonia leakage at the bunkering station, fuel preparation room, engine room and storage room and its impact on the ship's general arrangement. In addition, this study reviews and discusses various qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods employed in ships using low-flashpoint fuels and their relevance and potential suitability for ships powered by ammonia. The paper concludes with important findings and recommendations to aid designers, operators, safety experts, and policymakers in the further development of safety within the framework of risk assessment and management. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the safety considerations of using ammonia as a marine fuel and highlights the need for further research and development in this area.

AB  - Applications of metal hydrides (MHs) utilise a reversible interaction of hydride-forming metals, alloys and intermetallic compounds with hydrogen. The reversible process of the formation-decomposition of the MH when interacting with hydrogen allows to utilise several unique features of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation process. These features enable efficient storage of hydrogen gas resulting in a high volumetric efficiency of hydrogen storage while also storing thermal energy and converting it to the energy of compressed hydrogen gas or utilising the hydrides for the electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Thus, MH applications are very important as the components of the hydrogen energy systems integrating hydrogen supply from the metal hydride store and PEM fuel cells. Compact and safe hydrogen storage together with utilisation of the waste heat opens up for the commercial market of the hydrogen energy systems of green energy storage and supply.

AB  - Hydrogen has attracted growing research interest due to its exceptionally high energy per mass content and being a clean energy carrier, unlike the widely used hydrocarbon fuels. With the possibility of long-term energy storage and re-electrification, hydrogen promises to promote the effective utilization of renewable and sustainable energy resources. Clean hydrogen can be produced through a renewable-powered water electrolysis process. Although alkaline water electrolysis is currently the mature and commercially available electrolysis technology for hydrogen production, it has several shortcomings that hinder its integration with intermittent and fluctuating renewable energy sources. The proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology has been developed to offer high voltage efficiencies at high current densities. Besides, PEMWE cells are characterized by a fast system response to fluctuating renewable power, enabling operations at broader partial power load ranges while consistently delivering high-purity hydrogen with low ohmic losses. Recently, much effort has been devoted to improving the efficiency, performance, durability, and economy of PEMWE cells. The research activities in this context include investigations of different cell component materials, protective coatings, and material characterizations, as well as the synthesis and analysis of new electrocatalysts for enhanced electrochemical activity and stability with minimized use of noble metals. Further, many modeling studies have been reported to analyze cell performance considering cell electrochemistry, overvoltage, and thermodynamics. Thus, it is imperative to review and compile recent research studies covering multiple aspects of PEMWE cells in one literature to present advancements and limitations of this field. This article offers a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of PEMWE cells. It compiles recent research on each PEMWE cell component and discusses how the characteristics of these components affect the overall cell performance. In addition, the electrochemical activity and stability of various catalyst materials are reviewed. Further, the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of electrolytic water splitting are described, and inherent cell overvoltage are elucidated. The available literature on PEMWE cell modeling, aimed at analyzing the performance of PEMWE cells, is compiled. Overall, this article provides the advancements in cell components, materials, electrocatalysts, and modeling research for PEMWE to promote the effective utilization of renewable but intermittent and fluctuating energy in the pursuit of a seamless transition to clean energy.

AB  - Finding a balance between the agroecological benefits of in-field crop diversification and the associated management demands, while maintaining expected production levels, is essential for making crop diversity work for farmers. The aim of this study was to find a workable resolution of diversity within the context of an on-station organic arable cropping systems experiment in the Netherlands. The experiment tested a gradient of crop diversity treatments from sole-crop references to strip cropping (3 m x 54 m strips sown in adjacent crop pairs of varying complexity) and pixel cropping (0.25 m2 plots each sown with one out of six total crops and arranged in 7.5 m x 12 m grids). In these treatments we assessed the performance of multiple agroecosystem service (AES) indicators (soil fertility, crop yield and quality, weed cover and diversity, and natural enemy activity density) for three focal crops (cabbage, wheat, and potato) using three years of field data and a three-part analysis. First, we used linear mixed models to assess the effects of each diversification treatment on the AES indicators. We found no clear indication that one treatment performed better than the rest across AES indicators. Second, we developed a novel method for quantifying the temporal, spatial, and genetic structural diversity of the tested treatments into compound diversity scores, and used these scores to analyze response relationships between increasing in-field diversity and AES delivery. Here we found that increasing compound diversity had a positive effect on the indicators weed species diversity and natural enemy activity density. For production indicators, we observed an inflection point between the most diverse strip cropping treatment and the pixel cropping treatment, with pixel cropping performing notably poorly. Third, we used a multivariate analysis approach to assess the contribution of temporal, spatial, and genetic diversity to AES delivery, but found no clear effects of individual diversity dimensions on AES delivery. These findings suggest that prospects for strip cropping are better than for pixel cropping when it comes to balancing production aims with increases in other AES while also maintaining management feasibility. Reconciling management shortcomings in highly diverse cropping systems (e.g. through the development of appropriate technologies) may be one way to mitigate trade-offs between ecological and production aims at resolutions of diversity higher than strip cropping.

AB  - Off-Site Modular Construction (OSMC) research has been a burgeoning research area over the past two decades due to low productivity of traditional construction methods. Some large Gen 3 reactors may employ an on-site assembly area similar to shipbuilding techniques. This OSMC productivity has attracted the interest of the nuclear industry with over 50+ designs in commercial development. Off-site modular construction has been estimated to reduce the capital cost of an SMR by up to 37.98% compared to a stick-built method. The IAEA highlights the first commercial SMR “shop built and road transported to site” has an earliest operation date of 2026 (IAEA, 2018). This research paper aims to understand the current state of modular design in nuclear power by reviewing current literature with a systematic literature review. What can new small modular reactor designs learn from modularisation in large nuclear. What design and analysis techniques have been developed that may aid the design considering design, schedule, transportation and supply chain? What is the state of the art in the module design process? The research provides knowledge gaps and recommendations for further research.

AB  - Background
In the 21st century, Chinese hospitals have witnessed innovative medical business models, such as online diagnosis and treatment, cross-regional multidepartment consultation, and real-time sharing of medical test results, that surpass traditional hospital information systems (HISs). The introduction of cloud computing provides an excellent opportunity for hospitals to address these challenges. However, there is currently no comprehensive research assessing the cloud migration of HISs in China. This lack may hinder the widespread adoption and secure implementation of cloud computing in hospitals.
Objective
The objective of this study is to comprehensively assess external and internal factors influencing the cloud migration of HISs in China and propose promotional strategies.
Methods
Academic articles from January 1, 2007, to February 21, 2023, on the topic were searched in PubMed and HuiyiMd databases, and relevant documents such as national policy documents, white papers, and survey reports were collected from authoritative sources for analysis. A systematic assessment of factors influencing cloud migration of HISs in China was conducted by combining a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis and literature review methods. Then, various promotional strategies based on different combinations of external and internal factors were proposed.
Results
After conducting a thorough search and review, this study included 94 academic articles and 37 relevant documents. The analysis of these documents reveals the increasing application of and research on cloud computing in Chinese hospitals, and that it has expanded to 22 disciplinary domains. However, more than half (n=49, 52%) of the documents primarily focused on task-specific cloud-based systems in hospitals, while only 22% (n=21 articles) discussed integrated cloud platforms shared across the entire hospital, medical alliance, or region. The SWOT analysis showed that cloud computing adoption in Chinese hospitals benefits from policy support, capital investment, and social demand for new technology. However, it also faces threats like loss of digital sovereignty, supplier competition, cyber risks, and insufficient supervision. Factors driving cloud migration for HISs include medical big data analytics and use, interdisciplinary collaboration, health-centered medical service provision, and successful cases. Barriers include system complexity, security threats, lack of strategic planning and resource allocation, relevant personnel shortages, and inadequate investment. This study proposes 4 promotional strategies: encouraging more hospitals to migrate, enhancing hospitals’ capabilities for migration, establishing a provincial-level unified medical hybrid multi-cloud platform, strengthening legal frameworks, and providing robust technical support.
Conclusions
Cloud computing is an innovative technology that has gained significant attention from both the Chinese government and the global community. In order to effectively support the rapid growth of a novel, health-centered medical industry, it is imperative for Chinese health authorities and hospitals to seize this opportunity by implementing comprehensive strategies aimed at encouraging hospitals to migrate their HISs to the cloud.

AB  - A major challenge for the European electronic industry is to enhance productivity by ensuring quality of development, integration and maintenance while reducing the associated costs. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles and techniques have already shown promising capabilities, but they still need to scale up to support real-world scenarios implied by the full deployment and use of complex electronic components and systems. Moreover, maintaining efficient traceability, integration, and communication between two fundamental system life cycle phases (design time and runtime) is another challenge requiring the scalability of MDE. This paper presents an overview of the ECSEL 11http://www.ecsel-ju.eu/web/index.php. project entitled “MegaModelling at runtime – Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems” (MegaM@Rt2), whose aim is to address the above mentioned challenges facing MDE. Driven by both large and small industrial enterprises, with the support of research partners and technology providers, MegaM@Rt2 aims to deliver a framework of tools and methods for: 1) system engineering/design and continuous development, 2) related runtime analysis and 3) global models and traceability management. Diverse industrial use cases (covering strategic domains such as aeronautics, railway, construction and telecommunications) will integrate and demonstrate the validity of the MegaM@Rt2 solution. This paper provides an overview of the MegaM@Rt2 project with respect to its approach, mission, objectives as well as to its implementation details. It further introduces the consortium as well as describes the work packages and few already produced deliverables.

AB  - As a transversal concept tied to human evolution, security has increased its relevance at the same pace as development and digitisation. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the sophistication of advanced persistent threats, the emerging paradigm of cognitive security (i.e., defined by some authors as the use of self-aware and adaptable AI with learning capabilities to detect and mitigate security threats) gains momentum. Nevertheless, cognitive security is a complex concept that requires a more granular description. In this article, we redefine cognitive security by first analysing the state of the art to derive the current state of practice and the definitions of cognitive security. Next, we expand the concept of cognitive security by analysing its multiple pillars, including learning theories, AI technologies, human–computer interactions, and the ethical and legal aspects impacting its development and implementation. The latter is crucial towards understanding cognitive security, providing insight into its potential and prerequisites towards its realisation while emphasising its multidisciplinary nature. In addition to such a description, we analyse the current challenges in three closely interconnected fields, namely cybersecurity, digital forensics, and digital investigations, to provide a taxonomy that can be used to assess the current challenges and limitations of cognitive security and understand its potential better. Finally, we propose future research directions, aiming to develop cognitive systems capable of continuous learning, adaptation, and ethical compliance in dynamic cybersecurity environments. Our findings highlight the role of cognitive computing systems in enhancing cybersecurity, discussing the integration of human cognition and AI for proactive and resilient security solutions.

KW  - Sustainability
AB  - The United Nations has issued a warning over the limited time for climate disaster prevention. In the last two decades, several countries have set targets to reduce fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions. These goals are tracked through the adoption of energy systems that prioritise efficiency and low-carbon alternatives, in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the United Nations. In the winemaking sector, the wine produced in the European Union comprised 65 % of the worldwide total from 2014 to 2018, with vineyards making up 4.7 % of its farms in 2020. Electricity is the primary source of energy used in vineries, accounting for around 90 % of the total energy consumption. The energy consumption associated with winemaking is mostly attributed to two key processes: fermentation, which accounts for 45 % to 90 % of the entire energy consumption, and bottling and storage, which contribute around 18 % of the overall energy consumption. The aim of this article is to provide an integrated review of energy efficiency in wineries through examining 144 academic publications. The selected publications cover various aspects, including sustainable energy utilisation in the wine industry, thermal performance analysis of buildings, energy efficiency assessment of systems and technologies, and the integration of renewable energy sources. A link has been established between the geographic distribution of academic publications and wine-producing countries. In relation to European publications, it is observed that research funding is associated with the energy directives of the European Union. It can also be concluded that wine customers are pushing for environmentally friendly practices. However, not everyone in the winemaking sector is moving in the same direction or at the same pace. To identify areas for improvement, winemakers must have supporting tools to manage energy use. Systems optimisation, monitoring, and accounting can be used to decrease energy consumption in winemaking processes or equipment. Progresses on sustainable energy use through greater energy efficiency and share of renewable energies in the wineries can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and consequently, brings the wine industry closer to climate neutrality.

AB  - Abstracts
Infrastructure megaprojects are characterised by huge investment, vast complexity in technical and organisational terms, and extensive innovation. Innovation outcomes have been extensively investigated at the owner/operator and project-based firm/supplier levels (both combined shortly named ‘firm-level’), with the project-level being far less studied and the simultaneously study of firm and project innovation being a knowledge gap. Considering the case of infrastructure megaprojects in China, this paper identifies infrastructure megaprojects' innovation outcome measures at both the firm-level and project-level simultaneously and investigates their relationships. This paper employs a mixed-method approach leveraging interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and the matrix of cross-impact multiplications analysis. The model derives 22 innovation outcome measures, divided into five hierarchy levels, describing owner-level, supplier-level, and project-level innovation in infrastructure megaprojects. Five measures have the greatest driving power: 1) Creation or improvement in construction technology, 2) Creation or improvement in the construction process, 3) Creation of new construction standards, 4) Creation or improvement of contract form, and 5) Creation or improvement in financial arrangements. The results can help researchers and practitioners better understand how to evaluate and manage innovations at both the firm-level and project-level in infrastructure megaprojects.

AB  - Different membrane processes have been used to address water scarcity issues. Among them, membrane distillation (MD) is a promising technology due to its capacity to treat hypersaline water. Forward osmosis (FO) is another innovative technology that has the advantage of low operational energy. A hybrid system of these two technologies has proven to be an effective technique for the water treatment industry particularly for water reclamation and resource recovery. Understanding the fundamentals of this amalgamation and the challenges that brings with it is an important topic for the scientific and research community. This work presents a detailed review of the FO-MD systems enriched with the recent advances in this system. The opportunities and challenges for the individual technologies and the system overall were critically addressed. Successful pilot designs for the hybrid system were illustrated. Mathematical modeling for the water transfer in the hybrid system was also elaborated to identify the key points and boundaries of the processes. It is apparent that the inherent low energy conversion in MD and the need for draw solution regeneration are the prominent challenges of this system. Another important aspect to be highlighted is that the water transfer balance between MD and FO is the key requirement for a stable and successful operation. The use of alternative energy is possible but it is only feasible in specific cases such as the existence of seawater and wastewater facilities in a proximity or the case of produced water that contains geothermal heat. Implementing heat recovery in the MD stage, using functionalized particles as a source of osmolarity in the draw solution, and developing membrane materials with unique characteristics such as omniphobic and Janus MD membranes are effective strategies that have just recently shown to improve the systems economics and such strategies should be explored further.

AB  - Context:
An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy). The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning. These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities which could result in catastrophic outcomes (e.g., loss of lives). Given the growing interest in employing assurance cases to ensure that systems are developed to meet their requirements, exploring the management of assurance weakeners becomes beneficial.
Objective:
As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.
Methods:
We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study. We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012–2023 publication year range. Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners from a qualitative standpoint, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.
Results:
Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them from a qualitative perspective. The taxonomy classifies weakeners in four categories: aleatory, epistemic, ontological, and argument uncertainty. Additionally, it classifies approaches supporting the management of weakeners in three main categories: representation, identification and mitigation approaches.
Conclusion:
Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) – a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) – offers a comprehensive range of capabilities to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners. Our findings also suggest novel assurance weakener management approaches should be proposed to better assure mission-critical systems.

AB  - Background
When health service providers (HSP) plan to develop electronic health (eHealth) resources for health service users (HSU), the latter’s involvement is essential. Typically, however, HSP, HSU, and technology developers engaged to produce the resources lack expertise in participatory design methodologies suited to the eHealth context. Furthermore, it can be difficult to identify an established method to use, or determine how to work stepwise through any particular process.
Objective
We sought to summarize the evidence about participatory methods and frameworks used to engage HSU in the development of eHealth resources from the beginning of the design process.
Methods
We searched for studies reporting participatory processes in initial development of eHealth resources from 2006 to 2016 in 9 bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Emcare, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ACM Guide to Computing Literature, and IEEE Xplore. From 15,117 records initially screened on title and abstract for relevance to eHealth and early participatory design, 603 studies were assessed for eligibility on full text. The remaining 90 studies were rated by 2 reviewers using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011 (Pluye et al; MMAT) and analyzed with respect to health area, purpose, technology type, and country of study. The 30 studies scoring 90% or higher on MMAT were included in a detailed qualitative synthesis.
Results
Of the 90 MMAT-rated studies, the highest reported (1) health areas were cancer and mental disorders, (2) eHealth technologies were websites and mobile apps, (3) targeted populations were youth and women, and (4) countries of study were the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Of the top 30 studies the highest reported participatory frameworks were User-Centered Design, Participatory Action Research Framework, and the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management (CeHRes) Roadmap, and the highest reported model underpinning development and engagement was Social Cognitive Theory. Of the 30 studies, 4 reported on all the 5 stages of the CeHRes Roadmap.
Conclusions
The top 30 studies yielded 24 participatory frameworks. Many studies referred to using participatory design methods without reference to a framework. The application of a structured framework such as the CeHRes Roadmap and a model such as Social Cognitive Theory creates a foundation for a well-designed eHealth initiative that ensures clarity and enables replication across participatory design projects. The framework and model need to be clearly articulated and address issues that include resource availability, responsiveness to change, and the criteria for good practice. This review creates an information resource for future eHealth developers, to guide the design of their eHealth resource with a framework that can support further evaluation and development.

AB  - Frequency and severity of supply chain disruptions are increasing, and new solutions for improving supply chain resilience (SCRES) are demanded. Operations managers and scholars place great hopes on recent technological innovations, particularly blockchain technology. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive review at the intersection of SCRES and blockchain, making it difficult to understand the relations between both fields holistically. This research gap was addressed by systematically analyzing 72 peer-reviewed papers. More specifically, the link between specific blockchain characteristics, SCRES antecedents, and supply chain risk types was explored. The results reveal that visibility and validation are the most relevant blockchain characteristics for improving SCRES. The SCRES antecedents agility, collaboration, and supply chain (re-)engineering can all benefit from blockchain implementation, whereas the effect on risk management culture is widely unexplored. While there is consensus on blockchain’s usability for mitigating security, operational, and supply risks, the effect on demand risks requires further attention. To facilitate the practical implementation of this paper’s results, the findings served as a foundation for discussing SCRES opportunities from well-known blockchain applications such as smart contracts and tracking solutions. Moreover, seven future research avenues and managerial implications are presented.

AB  - The complexity, variety and volume of urban datasets have soared in the past decade. By utilising these datasets, urban planners and researchers have built a wide range of evidence-based methods and analytical tools for planning and decision-making purposes. However, the data heterogeneity remains one of the key problems in this process. Building generic urban analytics tools adaptable to diverse data formats remains largely unresolved in practice. This work proposes an innovative system called Urban Data Analytics Infrastructure (UADI) to tackle these challenges by leveraging on the advantages of ontology technologies. The proposed technique implements a bi-level mapping approach to consolidate heterogeneous datasets into a uniformed structure. This is presented in ontology schemas and hence offers a new means for developing generic tools for urban analytics. By applying bi-level mapping between data and ontology, the datasets are semantically enriched. This strategy allows data harmonisation, thus, heterogeneity problems could be mitigated. When building an analytics tool, researchers can simply declare the input data type as a specific concept of ontology and then follow the ontology schema to implement the code. The developed tool can be registered into the UADI system and then can work with any data mapped to the concept. The core components of the system include data registration, data enrichment, ontology management, translation engine, tool development and tool management. These are elaborately designed and developed to meet the design goals. The system usability and performance are validated by building a series of ISO 37120 indicators (for city services and quality of life) within the UADI.

AB  - Background
Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based products that prevent, manage, or treat a medical condition and are delivered through a smartphone app, web application, or wearable device. Clinical trials assessing DTx pose challenges, foremost among which is designing appropriate digital shams (or digital placebos), which should ideally mimic DTx (in terms of design, components, and duration of treatment) while omitting the active principle or component.
Objective
The objective of our review was to understand how digital shams are being used in clinical research on DTx in neuroscience, which is the most common therapy area for DTx.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review of DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) with a focus on controlled clinical trials involving digital shams. Studies were identified from trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, and Trial Trove) and through structured searches in MEDLINE and Embase (both via the Embase website) and were limited to articles in English published from 2010 onward. These were supplemented by keyword-based searches in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar and bibliographic searches. Studies assessing DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) were included. Details related to the publication, DTx, comparator, patient population, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed.
Results
Our search criteria identified 461 neuroscience studies involving 213 unique DTx. Most DTx were extended reality based (86/213, 40.4%) or mobile device based (56/213, 26.3%); 313 were comparative, of which 68 (21.7%) used shams. The most common therapeutic areas assessed in these studies were stroke (42/213, 19.7%), depression (32/213, 15%), and anxiety (24/213, 11.3%). The most common treatments were cognitive behavioral therapy or behavioral therapy (67/213, 32.4%), physical rehabilitation (60/213, 28.2%), and cognitive training (41/213, 19.2%). We identified the following important issues related to the use of digital shams in neuroscience: shams were not validated before use in studies, they varied widely in design (from being nearly identical to the DTx to using different software programs altogether), and the level of patient engagement or satisfaction with the sham and the impact of the sham on study outcomes were infrequently reported.
Conclusions
Digital shams are critical for the clinical development of DTx in neuroscience. Given the importance of sham controls in evaluating DTx efficacy, we provide recommendations on the key information that should be reported in a well-designed DTx trial and propose an algorithm to allow the correct interpretation of DTx study results. Sham-controlled studies should be routinely used in DTx trials—in early-phase studies—to help identify DTx active components and—in late-phase studies—to confirm the efficacy of DTx. The use of shams early in development will ensure that the appropriate sham control is used in later confirmatory trials.

AB  - The thriving development of live streaming commerce (LSC) has enhanced the significance of interpreting consumers’ purchase decisions with holistic theoretical support. Whereas, there is still a dearth of knowledge regarding a comprehensive list of the antecedents of purchase intention and the associations between these factors. This study employs a three-staged approach to develop an integrated conceptual model anchored on the mean-end-chain theory and perform a meta-analysis structural equation modeling (MASEM) of 173 research papers. The analysis results yield the associations between four attribute factors, five consequence factors, shopping value, and LSC purchase intention. Moreover, the effects of six moderators are explored to address the inconsistency issues in existing studies. A research agenda with rich implications is derived from the conclusion. In addition, a comprehensive list of managerial suggestions is synthesized incorporating existing literature and our research findings.

AB  - CONTEXT
Mixed farming and agroforestry systems (MiFAS) are widely proposed to deal with ecological, economic, and social challenges that are associated with specialised farming systems. However, little is known about how MiFAS are integrated in food value chains and how value creation in MiFAS is rewarded by value chain actors.
OBJECTIVE
We review the broad literature on MiFAS (80 papers) with a particular focus on implications for food value chains.
METHODS
We use thematic analysis to code existing evidence and categorise these codes into four major themes: MiFAS value creation, Impacts of the farming environment on value creation, Ecosystem service valuation, and Supply & value chain integration. From here, we produce meta-narratives to summarise the literature within each theme. In a second step, we use these literature insights to develop possible value chain configurations that operationalise MiFAS in food value chains.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We find that: a) integrating farming enterprises tends to improve yields and land-use efficiency and can reduce variable costs; b) MiFAS seem to face significant challenges with respect to fixed costs, such as of capital investments, and of labour; c) high opportunity costs associated with MiFAS can be a drawback for farms seeking to become more integrated as limited knowledge and the time to establish profitable MiFAS can deter adoption; d) sources of value creation within MiFAS stem from its ability to reduce variable costs as well as maintain or raise inputs, primarily by improving the efficiency of resources such as nutrients and land; and e) inter-farmer partnerships and collaboration have the potential to shorten MiFAS supply chains and extend value capture for farmers by allowing them greater ownership of value created.
SIGNIFICANCE
In total, insights into value chain implications of MiFAS are scarce. Therefore, our research delivers important implications for future research on MiFAS that should focus more on value chain implications of this emerging food production system.

AB  - Context
With the expansion of palliative care services in clinical settings, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have become increasingly crucial for assisting bedside nurses and other clinicians in improving the quality of care to patients with life-limiting health conditions.
Objectives
To characterize palliative care CDSSs and explore end-users' actions taken, adherence recommendations, and clinical decision time.
Methods
The CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched from inception to September 2022. The review was developed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Qualified studies were described in tables and assessed the level of evidence.
Results
A total of 284 abstracts were screened, and 12 studies comprised the final sample. The CDSSs selected focused on identifying patients who could benefit from palliative care based on their health status, making referrals to palliative care services, and managing medications and symptom control. Despite the variability of palliative CDSSs, all studies reported that CDSSs assisted clinicians in becoming more informed about palliative care options leading to better decisions and improved patient outcomes. Seven studies explored the impact of CDSSs on end-user adherence. Three studies revealed high adherence to recommendations while four had low adherence. Lack of feature customization and trust in guideline-based in the initial stages of feasibility and usability testing were evident, limiting the usefulness for nurses and other clinicians.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that implementing palliative care CDSSs can assist nurses and other clinicians in improving the quality of care for palliative patients. The studies' different methodological approaches and variations in palliative CDSSs made it challenging to compare and validate the applicability under which CDSSs are effective. Further research utilizing rigorous methods to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support features and guideline-based actions on clinicians' adherence and efficiency is recommended.

AB  - The need for strategies to manage failures and disruptions becomes increasingly crucial, as Industry 4.0 continues to redefine manufacturing and industrial processes. This systematic literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding resilience strategies towards the paradigm of Industry 5.0. The integration of advanced technologies and the growing complexity of modern production systems introduce new challenges, such as the potential for cascading failures and disruptions in production environments. These challenges highlight the urgency of identifying effective resilience strategies to maintain system integrity, minimize downtime, and increase product and process quality. This review identifies existing research on resilience strategies in manufacturing, focusing on their applicability, trends, and potential research gaps. Insights are intended to guide researchers and industry practitioners in developing robust failure management approaches. A systematic literature analysis in major academic databases was conducted, selecting peer-reviewed articles published between 2013 and 2023. Keywords related to failure management and associated concepts were used to identify relevant studies. The inclusion criteria focused on research that presented empirical evidence or theoretical insights into resilience strategies. Our review reveals a diverse body of literature that explores various resilience strategies towards the vision of Industry 5.0, including a stronger focus on supporting operators, predictive failure analysis, supply chain modelling, and data management. These strategies aim to enhance system robustness, adaptability, and recovery capabilities. However, there is a notable lack of standardization and consensus on the most effective approaches. This paper contributes to synthesizing and categorizing the findings, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the current research landscape.

The twelve factors are grouped into four themes: “Activity planning and execution”, “System thinking”, “Speed” and “Confidence through test activities”. Based on the interview results and a literature study we present the EMFIS model, which allows companies to explicate a representation of the organization's current situation regarding continuous integration impediments, and visualizes what the organization must focus on in order to enable more frequent integration of software. The model is used to perform an assessment of the twelve factors, where the ratings from participants representing the developers are summarized separately from ratings from participants representing the enablers (responsible for processes, development tools, test environments etc.). The EMFIS model has been validated in workshops and interviews, which in total included 46 individuals in five case study companies. The model was well received during the validation, and was appreciated for its simplicity and its ability to show differences in rating between developers and enablers.

AB  - Background
With the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase and scaling up of provider-to-provider telemedicine programs that connect frontline health providers such as nurses and community health workers at primary care clinics with remote doctors at tertiary facilities to facilitate consultations for rural patients. Considering this new trend of increasing use of telemedicine, this study was conducted to generate evidence for patients, health providers, and policymakers to compare if provider-to-provider telemedicine-based care is equivalent to in-person care and is safe and acceptable in terms of diagnostic and treatment standards.
Objective
This study aims to compare the diagnosis and treatment decisions from teleconsultations to those of in-person care in teleclinics in rural Gujarat.
Methods
We conducted a diagnostic concordance study using a randomized crossover study design with 104 patients at 10 telemedicine primary care clinics. Patients reporting to 10 telemedicine primary care clinics were randomly assigned to first receive an in-person doctor consultation (59/104, 56.7%) or to first receive a health worker–assisted telemedicine consultation (45/104, 43.3%). The 2 groups were then switched, with the first group undergoing a telemedicine consultation following the in-person consultation and the second group receiving an in-person consultation after the teleconsultation. The in-person doctor and remote doctor were blinded to the diagnosis and management plan of the other. The diagnosis and treatment plan of in-person doctors was considered the gold standard.
Results
We enrolled 104 patients reporting a range of primary health care issues into the study. We observed 74% (77/104) diagnostic concordance and 79.8% (83/104) concordance in the treatment plan between the in-person and remote doctors. No significant association was found between the diagnostic and treatment concordance and the order of the consultation (P=.65 and P=.81, respectively), the frontline health worker–doctor pair (both P=.93), the gender of the patient (both P>.99), or the mode of teleconsultation (synchronous vs asynchronous; P=.32 and P=.29, respectively), as evaluated using Fisher exact tests. A significant association was seen between the diagnostic and treatment concordance and the type of case (P=.004 and P=.03, respectively). The highest diagnostic concordance was seen in the management of hypertension (20/21, 95% concordance; Cohen kappa=0.93) and diabetes (14/15, 93% concordance; Cohen kappa=0.89). The lowest values were seen in cardiology (1/3, 33%) and patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms (3/10, 30%). The use of a digital assistant to facilitate the consultation resulted in increased adherence to evidence-based care protocols.
Conclusions
The findings reflect that telemedicine can be a safe and acceptable alternative mode of care especially in remote rural settings when in-person care is not accessible. Telemedicine has advantages. for the potential gains for improved health care–seeking behavior for patients, reduced costs for the patient, and improved health system efficiency by reducing overcrowding at tertiary health facilities.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is valuable for quantifying the overall environmental footprint and trade-offs of services, packaging, and products. Packaging plays a critical role in containing, safeguarding, and delivering goods globally. LCA studies have extensively examined packaging attributes like functionality, structure (rigid or flexible), and materials to make recommendations. However, conflicting advice has emerged from different LCA studies on similar packaging systems, raising questions about whether material neutrality and a holistic environmental perspective are fundamental principles used for selecting packaging with the optimal environmental footprint. A meta-analysis of LCA studies on packaging systems was conducted to address this issue. We assessed adherence to ISO 14040/44:2006 standards based on ISO/TS 14071 guideline review requirements, identified the primary packaging formats studied, evaluated differences in environmental footprint among packaging alternatives, and examined consistencies and discrepancies among the studies. Most studies claimed adherence to ISO standards, though checks were inconsistent. The leading packaging formats analyzed included bottles, aseptic cartons, bags, and cans, with various reported greenhouse gas emissions for a standard functional unit. Discrepancies were found in primary and secondary data used in LCA studies, revealing research gaps. Recommendations are offered to enhance LCA studies of product and packaging systems, making them more robust instruments for informing environmentally conscious policy decisions and promoting sustainable development. Based on the study's findings, it is recommended that the system boundaries, assumptions, inventory, databases, and calculation procedures be clearly defined. When including end-of-life, a detailed description of the modeling should be specified, especially the methodology used when considering recycling content and rate. For comparative studies, results should be reported as a breakdown of all the phases.

AB  - Purpose
Addressing global warming challenge, carbon emissions reduction potential of the construction industry has received additional attentions. The decoupling of construction industry and carbon emissions through policies, technologies and model innovations is an effective way for reducing environmental pollution and achieve eco-urban target. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach
Within the scope of green building carbon emissions (GB-CO2) research, a large number of scientific literature has been published in construction discipline over the past few decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary of strategies, techniques, models and scientific discussion of future direction of GB-CO2 is lacking. Therefore, this paper carries out data mining on authoritative journals, identified the key research topics, active research areas and further research trends through visualization studies.
Findings
This study contributes to the body of knowledge in GB-CO2 by critically reviewing and summarizing: professional high-quality journals have a greater influence in the scope of research, developed countries and developing countries are all very concerned about sustainable buildings, and the current hot topics of research focus on the application of the life cycle models, energy efficiency, environmental performance of concrete material, etc. Moreover, further research areas that could expand the knowledge of cross-national long-term carbon mechanisms, develop comprehensive life cycle carbon emissions assessment models, build technical standards and tests for the sustainable building material and systems, and exploit multi-objective decision models considering decarbonizing design and renewable energy.
Originality/value
This study is of value in systematic insight the state-of-the-art of GB-CO2 research in the more recent decade. A more vividly and effectively method is documented in extending the traditional bibliometric review to a deeper discussion. This study can also benefit construction practitioners by providing them a focused perspective of strategy and technologies innovations for emerging practices in green building projects.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a part of people's lives and is progressively revolutionizing our lives and businesses. From a Digital Forensics (DF) point of view, this connection turns an IoT environment into a valuable source of evidence containing diverse artifacts that could significantly aid DF investigations. Therefore, DF must adapt to the characteristics of IoT Forensics (IoTF). With the increasing deployment of IoT, organizations are compelled to revise their approaches to planning, developing, and implementing Information Technology (IT) security strategies. The IoT presents new business opportunities but also simultaneously creates various challenges related to cyber-attacks and their resolution. For optimal preparedness in the face of future incidents, companies should consider implementing Forensics Readiness (FR). This paper thus examines the factors that influence IoT-FR within organizations. By systematically analyzing research efforts from 2010 to 2023, we identified the following factors influencing IoT-FR: (1) Legal Aspect, (2) Standardization Approach, (3) Technological Resource and Technique, (4) Management Process and (5) Human Factor. Furthermore, these influencing factors are not only considered individually but also in terms of the dependencies between them. This results in the creation of a holistic model including the interdependencies and influences of the factors to provide a novel overview and enhance the integrated perspective on IoT-FR. The knowledge of factors influencing the integration of IoT-FR into organizations is valuable. It thus can be of enormous importance, as it can save time and money in the event of a subsequent incident. Additionally, alongside these factors, various challenges, techniques, models, and frameworks are highlighted to offer profound insights into the relatively novel subject of IoT-FR and to inspire future research.

AB  - The rate of access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is just 42 %. The private market for household-scale off-grid solar (OGS) products (pico solar and solar home systems) is regarded as a key tool for increasing electricity access in SSA. However, the growing volume of unabated waste from OGS products poses a significant environmental risk. Based on a systematic literature review of 52 papers, the dynamics of SSA's OGS market, the drivers of OGS waste, the environmental and health impactions of OGS waste, the barriers to waste management, and potential circular economy solutions to address SSA's OGS waste flow are analysed. The market landscape is decentralised and predominantly unregulated. The lifetime of OGS products is found to be short (less than four years), limited by affordability constraints, the lack of local technical expertise, detrimental usage habits, and low access to maintenance and repair services. The widespread uptake of OGS products and short product lifetimes has resulted in rapidly increasing waste volumes across SSA (an estimated 12,000 tonnes of waste generated in 2020, a 545 % increase from 2016). The current informal recycling practices are found to have extremely severe environmental consequences. In particular, the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries is a primary driver of lead exposure in SSA. Formal waste management initiatives are hindered by competition with informal practices, inadequate legislation, the complexity of reverse logistics, the negative recycling value of some OGS products, and the absence of sophisticated formal recycling infrastructure. Furthermore, the emerging consensus on how to address SSA's OGS waste, from the industry's body and legislation across SSA, is found to be inadequate as it fails to address the majority of the waste flow. Finally, the authors recommend circular economy solutions such as promoting local resource conservation activities and pursuing effective public-private partnerships to capitalise on domestic value generating activities within the OGS waste chain.

AB  - Developing packaging with enhanced features helps organisations transition from a linear to a circular economy. The paper aims at mapping the barriers, incentives and potential outcomes which can be reached by organisations via such innovative packaging solutions and providing insights to researchers concerning the application of their knowledge in this complex field. Our study comprises 130 articles from 1991 to 2021, identified through a systematic review methodology. The evolution of intelligent packaging was classified and mapped taking into account the principles of circular economy, the main incentives and barriers which can help or hinder the upsurge of the packaging with enhanced features, and the potential outcomes that can be achieved by organisations. By using a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) combined with the Choice of Active Categories (COREM) approach, three clusters were identified: (i) buying process, (ii) value chain issues, (iii) collaborative issues. These clusters enable researchers to position their future contributions in the area and associated insights linked to new trends in the packaging field should facilitate managers in developing strategic pathways and supporting action research to enhance their packaging solutions. The paper also suggests to “decompose” the field, by starting with bottom-up studies with a circumscribed scope, and then synergically puts them together into a more general perspective.

AB  - Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have potential to revolutionize energy storage if technical issues like capacity loss, material stability, safety and cost can be properly resolved. The recent use of nanostructured materials to address limitations of conventional LIB components shows promise in this regard. This review traces research advancements on nanomaterials for LIBs over the past three decades. A comprehensive scientometric analysis of over 100,000 publications reveals exponential growth in nano-LIB research since the 1990s. China and USA lead publications, while the USA dominates nano-LIB patents. In addition to scientific articles, patents are also analyzed in the field of nano-LIB where USA entities lead the filed, granted, and published patents. The technical review examines progress and opportunities for nanostructured anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, separators, and thermal management. Key anode nanomaterials like carbon and silicon aim to boost kinetics and stability. Cathode nanostructures of layered oxides target enhanced rate capability. Nanoparticles in electrolytes and separators improve conductivity and strength. Nanofluids and nanocomposite phase change materials assist thermal regulation. Overall, nanostructures can potentially optimize LIB components, but holistic analysis is needed across all elements. Critical future work should address cost-performance-stability tradeoffs for sustainable nano-LIB commercialization. This review summarizes progress and challenges in nano-LIBs to aid researchers in identifying promising directions.

AB  - Extractives industries are increasingly operating on Indigenous Peoples’ territories and can have profound environmental and socio-cultural (including human rights) impacts for these and other stakeholders. Sustainability standards (i.e. best-practice operational procedures, including sector-specific certification programs) have emerged to mitigate these impacts and improve the benefits for impacted communities. Best-practice design, implementation and verification of sustainability standards underpinning certification programs requires active participation by Indigenous Peoples. This study uses literature review and a survey of key informants to both map the literature relevant to the participation of Indigenous Peoples in extractives industry certification programs and standards, and to highlight best-practices in program governance and assurance processes. There is little literature on Indigenous Peoples’ participation in certification program governance and assurance processes. The literature is dominated by reporting on the environmental and socio-cultural impacts of extractives developments for Indigenous Peoples, and associated conflicts and negotiations/agreements to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes consistent with international norms. In this context, there is an increasing focus on Indigenous Peoples’ ‘Free, Prior & Informed Consent’ (FPIC). Key informants identified few best-practice examples of Indigenous Peoples’ participation in sustainability standards for extractives. Most emphasised the importance of Indigenous Peoples’ FPIC in project development, operation and completion. Discussions also highlighted limitations of standard assurance processes and the potential for simple but innovatively-applied digital technologies to support Indigenous Peoples’ participation in data collection for auditing. A key concern for Indigenous communities impacted by extractives developments is effective rehabilitation of their biocultural landscapes, incorporating environmental values, cultural traditions (i.e. obligations and practices) and provision for sustainable livelihoods. The study’s findings provide guidance for certification program managers, extractives operators and auditors to improve engagement of Indigenous Peoples in certification program governance and assurance processes.

AB  - Objective: Active safety systems, of which antilock braking is a prominent example, are going to play an important role to improve powered two-wheeler (PTW) safety. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on active safety for PTWs. The aim was to list all systems under development, identify knowledge gaps and recognize promising research areas that require further efforts. Methods: A broad search using “safety” as the main keyword was performed on Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, followed by manual screening to identify eligible papers that underwent a full-text review. Finally, the selected papers were grouped by general technology type and analyzed via structured form to identify the following: specific active safety system, study type, outcome type, population/sample where applicable, and overall findings. Results: Of the 8,000 papers identified with the initial search, 85 were selected for full-text review and 62 were finally included in the study, of which 34 were journal papers. The general technology types identified included antilock braking system, autonomous emergency braking, collision avoidance, intersection support, intelligent transportation systems, curve warning, human machine interface systems, stability control, traction control, and vision assistance. Approximately one third of the studies considered the design and early stage testing of safety systems (n. 22); almost one fourth (n.15) included evaluations of system effectiveness. Conclusions: Our systematic review shows that a multiplicity of active safety systems for PTWs were examined in the scientific literature, but the levels of development are diverse. A few systems are currently available in the series production, whereas other systems are still at the level of early-stage prototypes. Safety benefit assessments were conducted for single systems, however, organized comparisons between systems that may inform the prioritization of future research are lacking. Another area of future analysis is on the combined effects of different safety systems, that may be capitalized for better performance and to maximize the safety impact of new technologies.

AB  - New modular factory-built methodologies implemented in the construction and industrial plant industries may bring down costs for modular reactors. A factory-built environment brings about benefits such as; improved equipment, tools, quality, shift patterns, training, continuous improvement learning, environmental control, standardisation, parallel working, the use of commercial off shelf equipment and much of the commissioning can be completed before leaving the factory. All these benefits combine to reduce build schedules, increase certainty, reduce risk and make financing easier and cheaper.Currently, the construction and industrial chemical plant industries have implemented successful modular design and construction techniques. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to understand and analyse the state of the art research in these industries through a systematic literature review. The research can then be assessed and applied to modular reactors.The literature review highlighted analysis methods that may prove to be useful. These include; modularisation decision tools, stakeholder analysis, schedule, supply chain, logistics, module design tools and construction site planning. Applicable research was highlighted for further work exploration for designers to assess, develop and efficiently design their modular reactors.

AB  - This review examines the potential of perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells for clean hydrogen production, a vital component of the global shift toward sustainable energy. Utilizing a systematic review of literature from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, this study provides recent advancements and identifies persistent challenges in the application of perovskite PVs for hydrogen generation. Despite their market dominance, traditional silicon PV cells have limitations that perovskite PVs may overcome. While silicon PV cells achieve efficiencies between 23.3% and 26.7%, lababoratory-scale tandem perovskite PV devices have surpassed this, with efficiencies exceeding 29.8% and a greater potential for future improvement. This efficiency leap positions them as promising candidates for hydrogen production via electrolysis. However, the scalability, stability, and environmental impacts of perovskite PVs necessitate further research in materials science. The review highlights the critical need for advancements in material properties and system integration, as well as supportive policies to foster the adoption of perovskite PVs. Ultimately, the review proposes a strategic framework for optimizing hydrogen production with perovskite-based PV technology, making a significant contribution to the discourse on sustainable hydrogen solutions.

AB  - The growing demand for data-driven decision-making and the emergence of new business models has led to a rise in digital technologies. As a result, businesses have become more aware of the impact of their activities on the environment, including the production of digital technologies. Sustainability has become a significant concern for businesses worldwide, pushing them to explore ways to integrate sustainable practices into their operations and address this issue. Digitization has emerged as an essential tool, with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology leading the way. Organizations can improve decision-making and enhance operational efficiency with IoT, but aligning its implementation with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Concepts like Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy principles have emerged to create sustainable business models, but their implementation faces various challenges. Businesses must adopt analytical methods and tools to support strategic planning. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method to identify twelve key challenges businesses face in this IoT adoption. A survey was used for gathering expert opinion from industry specialists working in the field of IoT for conducting advanced analytical techniques like Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (F-ISM) and Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement (MICMAC) to highlight the most critical challenges, including loss of value appropriation, Low incentive to change, Less adoption of sustainable practices and Lack of interoperability. While IoT holds great promise for supporting sustainable development, the result highlights the urgent need for stakeholder collaboration to overcome these challenges and unlock its full potential. The findings of this study benefit organizations heavily dependent on digital services like IoT by providing them with a comprehensive framework for effectively implementing IoT towards sustainable development.

ML is applied in many software-intensive products and services and introduces new opportunities and security challenges. AI and ML will gain even more attention from the industry in the future, but threats caused by already-discovered attacks specifically targeting ML models are either overseen, ignored, or mishandled. Current AML research investigates attack and defense scenarios for ML in different industrial settings with a varying degree of maturity with regard to academic rigor and practical relevance. However, to the best of our knowledge, a synthesis of the state of academic rigor and practical relevance is missing. This literature study reviews studies in the area of AML in the context of industry, measuring and analyzing each study’s rigor and relevance scores. Overall, all studies scored a high rigor score and a low relevance score, indicating that the studies are thoroughly designed and documented but miss the opportunity to include touch points relatable for practitioners.

AB  - The global push for renewable energy increase, including hydropower, as outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), emphasizes the need for systematic evaluations to support informed decisions for sustainable growth and development of hydropower sources. This systematic literature review examines the current state of research and highlights gaps related to systematic approaches such as life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) in evaluating impacts of hydropower systems. An analysis of literature from the Scopus and Web of Science databases between January 2013 and April 2025, using the PSALSAR framework, revealed that studies focused on LCA dominated at 98 %, with S-LCA studies accounted for only 2 %, and no studies on LCC or LCSA. Geographically, the identified studies were concentrated in Asia, with minimal representation from Africa. This implies a need for lifecycle-based approach studies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The current global agenda to decarbonize the energy sector has led to more studies evaluating the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Other critical environmental indicators such as water and land use are less evaluated, which are imperative parameters when realising hydropower potential. Moreover, inconsistencies in conducting LCA studies can undermine the credibility of LCA approach in delivering reliable results; thus, a comprehensive LCA covering all impact categories is necessary. Additionally, it is essential to standardize methods for assessing reservoir emissions and operative water use alongside the LCA approach to provide accurate estimates and reliable results for decision-makers.

AB  - This paper is thought to be an early attempt to address both the systematic and scientometric quantitative and qualitative data analysis of the worldwide research trends on photovoltaic maximum power point tracking (PV-MPPT) from 1995 to 2021. The science mapping of notable PV-MPPT research outlets, co-authorship network, articles’ citations network, keywords network, and active countries network in PV-MPPT research have been provided, discussed, and analysed. On the other hand, the major worldwide research trends of the PV-MPPT energy technologies have been discussed, classified, compared, and analysed, focusing on the significant issues and hot development areas that attracted the attention of worldwide researchers, industrial sectors, and countries. To the best of our knowledge, the worldwide research trends of PV-MPPT energy technologies have two major techniques: control circuit-based and power circuit-based techniques. The control-circuit based techniques are classified into nature-inspired MPPT and hybrid MPPT algorithms. On the other hand, the power circuit-based techniques have been classified into PV array-based and PV system arrangement-based techniques. The detailed comparisons proved that, both nature-inspired and hybrid algorithms performed well in case of static partial shade conditions (PSCs) with one global maximum peak (GMP), but they required reinitialization to track the dynamic GMP under dynamic PSCs. The hybrid MPPT algorithms performed well compared with the nature inspired MPPT algorithms in terms of GMP tracking, tracking speed, and fluctuations around GMP. However, their cost and complexity are high. This review enhances the collaboration between worldwide researchers and prominent countries in the PV energy area and provides some insights and future perspectives.

This article surveys the recent ML approaches utilised for ship collision avoidance (COLAV) and mission planning. Following an overview of the ever-expanding ML exploitation for maritime vehicles, key topics in the mission planning of ships are outlined. Notable papers with direct and indirect applications to the COLAV subject are technically reviewed and compared. Critiques, challenges, and future directions are also identified. The outcome clearly demonstrates the thriving research in this field, even though commercial marine ships incorporating machine intelligence able to perform autonomously under all operating conditions are still a long way off.

AB  - One of the most essential factors affecting socio-economic growth is energy. In addition to rising fuel prices, climate change has led to an interest in finding alternative sources of energy. Renewable energy sources, especially those based on hybrid systems, are very popular as alternative sources of energy. The integration of hybrid energy systems into the main grid has permitted the use of microgrids that operate in both on- and off-grid modes. The literature has paid a lot of attention to the optimisation of hybrid microgrid systems. To get useful and fair information for future research trends, this study evaluates three major themes (microgrids, renewable energy, and optimisation). Through a comprehensive evaluation of the literature on hybrid microgrid optimisation and a review based on a bibliometric analysis of 2,307 Scopus records, this work employs SciMAT software to assess the state of this research area. Additionally, hidden themes and their evolution in this area were discovered from 2005 to 2021, and strategic diagrams were made to illustrate the thematic development and performance metrics throughout the course of three time periods. The findings show that this scientific subject is constantly evolving, which is supported by the significant increase in research papers, especially in the recent five years. Since 2016, studies have mostly focused on microgrids and multi-objective optimisation. In the first period, studies concentrated on smart grids and optimisation. A trend toward employing these energy systems as an alternative to conventional grids may be seen by the rise in research publications discussing microgrids that are integrated with renewable energy sources. The utilization of microgrids still faces various challenges, the most frequent of which are stakeholders, technical and financial challenges, and unpredictable renewable energy sources. This report provides a summary of the existing situation and identifies exciting new research opportunities.

AB  - Deploying aerial infrastructure to support traditional terrestrial wireless communications has enhanced the maturity of 5G networks and beyond. This improvement has certainly benefited video streaming services whose data makes up the bulk of mobile traffic and continues to soar. Realising this fashion, artificial intelligence is considered as one of the important tools, which can effectively deal with various problems to improve and optimise many aspects of video streaming systems. However, there is still a lack of a systematic investigation of recent works in this field to facilitate researchers with a comprehensive reference framework to advance the development of the technology. Realising this shortcoming, this paper has dedicatedly investigated the recent achievements in using AI and the future challenges of the system. First, the basic knowledge and overall architecture of the aerial video streaming (AVS) system are given. Subsequently, achievable utilities are thoroughly evaluated by highlighting each system performance mathematically and analysing recent technical works to address them. Next, typical application scenarios are acquired to demonstrate the advantages to human life and the necessity of their implementation. Finally, open challenges are discussed to drive future technological developments towards video streaming over aerial infrastructure.

AB  - The rapid adoption of online learning in higher education has resulted in significant cybersecurity challenges. As educational institutions increasingly rely on digital platforms, they are facing cyber threats that can compromise sensitive data and disrupt operations. This systematic literature review explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into traditional methods to address cybersecurity risks in online higher education. The review integrates a qualitative synthesis of relevant literature and a quantitative meta-analysis using PRISMA guidelines, ensuring comprehensive insights into the integration process. The most prevalent cybersecurity threats are examined, and the effectiveness of AI-based and conventional approaches in mitigating these challenges is compared. Additionally, the most effective AI techniques in cybersecurity solutions are analyzed, and their performance is compared across different contexts. Furthermore, the review considers the key ethical and technical considerations associated with integrating AI into traditional cybersecurity methods. The findings reveal that while AI-based techniques offer promising solutions for threat detection, authentication, and privacy preservation, their successful implementation requires careful consideration of data privacy, fairness, transparency, and robustness. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, continuous monitoring of AI models—by automated systems and humans—and the need for comprehensive guidelines to ensure responsible and ethical use of AI in cybersecurity are highlighted. The findings of this review provide actionable insights for educational institutions, educators, and students, helping to facilitate the development of secure and resilient online learning environments. The identified ethical and technical considerations can serve as a foundation for the responsible integration of AI into cybersecurity within the online higher-education sector.

AB  - During the last 20 years, eye-tracking has become an important method for researchers in different fields like medicine, psychology, marketing, and even gaming. However, analysis tools are scarce. In this paper, we introduce our openly available software solution that can visualize saccadic eye-movement and calculate reaction times from saccadic paradigms, e.g. the antisaccade task. It further includes an error classification and processes the raw data into a trial-by-trial (target) output. Reaction times and error rates are typically estimated as performance indicators for this task. Moreover, the tool includes blink detection as well as a pupil size based fine tuning, which may be interesting for research assessing cognitive load and synchronization processes. The software is multi-platform, succinct, and easily extendable.

AB  - As our societies become more and more risk averse, the risk levels of the early expedition missions are no longer tolerable. Risk management in the space sector is rapidly growing to cope with increasing risks coming out of more advanced and complex systems. In this paper, the necessity of the use of risk management methods is illustrated through an analysis of the evolution of mission failures over the years coupled with a literature overview of the state-of-the-art tools focusing on mission classification frameworks. A bibliometric analysis is also performed with the aid of the VOSviewer software on a corpus of 6375 scientific documents extracted from the SCOPUS database. Six clusters of risk parameters are identified: a) dependability and reliability, b) cost and criticality to the agency, c) complexity, d) manned space missions, e) mission objectives and f) space hazards. The results show that two of the parameters, previously omitted in the mission classification frameworks of NASA and ESA, manned space missions and space hazards, should be included in the set of a mission’s risk parameters. Finally, the paper concludes with a geographical and research fields’ distribution analysis of the available publications.

AB  - Energy systems analyses are integrated elements in planning the transition towards renewable energy-based energy systems. This is due to a growing complexity arising from the wider exploitation of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) and an increasing reliance on sector integration as an enabler of temporal energy system integration, but it calls for consideration to the validity of modelling tools. This article synthesises EnergyPLAN applications through an analysis of its use both from a bibliometric and a case-geographical point of view and through a review of the evolution in the issues addressed and the results obtained using EnergyPLAN. This synthesis is provided with a view to addressing the validity and contribution of EnergyPLAN-based research. As of July 1st, 2022, EnergyPLAN has been applied in 315 peer-reviewed articles, and we see the very high application as an inferred internal validation. In addition, the review shows how the complexity of energy systems analyses has increased over time with early studies focusing on the role of wind power and the cogeneration of heat and power and later studies addressing contemporarily novel issues like the sector integration offered by using power-to-x in fully integrated renewable energy systems. Important findings developed through the application of EnergyPLAN includes the value of district heating in energy systems, the value of district heating for integration of VRES and more generally the importance of sector integration for resource-efficient renewable energy-based energy systems. The wide application across systems and development stages is interpreted as inferred validation through distributed stepwise replication.
