AB  - We used a novel meta regression analysis approach to examine the effectiveness of psychological skills training and behavioral interventions in sport assessed using single-case experimental designs (SCEDs). One hundred and twenty-one papers met the inclusion criteria applied to eight database searches and key sport psychology journals. Seventy-one studies reported sufficient detail for effect sizes to be calculated for the effects of psychological skills training on psychological, behavioral, and performance variables. The unconditional mean effect size for weighted (Δ = 2.40) and unweighted (Δ = 2.83) models suggested large improvements in psychological, behavioral, and performance outcomes associated with implementing cognitive-behavioral psychological skills training and behavioral interventions with a SCED. However, meta-regression analysis revealed important heterogeneities and sources of bias within this literature. First, studies using a group-based approach reported lower effect sizes compared to studies using single-case approaches. Second, the single-case studies, (over 90 per cent the effect sizes), revealed upwardly biased effect sizes arising from: (i) positive publication bias such that studies using lower numbers of baseline observations reported larger effects, while studies using larger numbers of baseline observations reported smaller – but still substantial – effects; (ii) not adopting a multiple baseline design; and (iii) not establishing procedural reliability. We recommend that future researchers using SCED’s should consider these methodological issues.

AB  - Due to the high complexity of modern-day business, organizations are forced to quickly adapt to a wide range of cutting-edge developments. These developments influence the structure and behavior of the business processes that represent the work and of the Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) that support them. Consequently, the architecture of BPMS has changed a lot over the past two decades. However, there is no systematic overview of the research done in this area since the Workflow reference model first set the standard for BPMS architecture in 1995. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BPMS architectures, by analyzing 41 primary studies taken from a gross collection of 608 research papers. The BPMS architectures that served as primary studies were compared with respect to the reference architecture that they are based on, the level of elaboration at which they are described, the architectural styles that they use, the means with which they are evaluated, and the functionality that they support. The resulting comparison provides an overview of and insights into the current body of knowledge on BPMS architectures.

AB  - Driving simulators (DS) serve as pivotal platforms for the rigorous testing of transportation systems and vehicles, offering a safe, controllable experimental environment with features like design visualization, scenario virtualization, and test data quantification. The validation of simulator experiments relies on the realism of the driving experience and scenario fidelity, crucial for assessing data reliability and result credibility. With the advent of autonomous driving technologies, the frequency of DS utilization has seen a marked expansion. Nonetheless, the discourse surrounding DS validation remains nascent, lacking a consolidated framework of standards and evaluative methodologies. This review endeavors to synthesize existing scholarly discourse and reports on the validation of driving simulators, further probing into the suitability of various driving scenarios and tasks. Common scenarios include car-following, lane-changing, and acceleration/deceleration, while tasks encompass human-machine co-piloting, takeover scenarios, and emergency evasion, considering driver conditions such as fatigue and distraction. Extracting universal indicators from various scenarios, including longitudinal and lateral velocities, accelerations, and trajectories, the paper summarizes the experimental workflow and commonly used statistical testing methods and psychophysiological monitoring devices for driving simulator validation. Considering the multidimensional factors influencing validation, this study discusses the relationships between simulation fidelity, degrees of freedom (DOF), and simulator sickness, proposing reference standards for driving simulator validation. This effort aims to advance the establishment of evaluation norms for simulation-based transportation and vehicle research, ensuring scientific rigor and empirical validity.

AB  - Accident analysis methods are used to identify contributory factors and the entire cause-effect process leading to an accident. The safety science literature has emphasized the suitability and popularity of systems thinking accident analysis methods, particularly Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), AcciMap, Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP), and Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), for analyzing accidents in sociotechnical systems. However, a comprehensive literature review and bibliometric analysis of systemic accident modelling in railways are missing. This paper aims to fill this gap and analyze the state of the art of systems thinking accident analysis with application to the railway from 2000 to November 2022. Moreover, the systemic methods are compared regarding the systems theory and practical characteristics. By employing a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, 32 relevant studies were identified from Scopus and Web of Science databases and a backward search. The review highlights the popularity of HFACS and STAMP in railway accident studies, with recent attention on FRAM. The research direction in applying systemic accident modelling for railways focused on analyzing railway accidents along with qualitative and quantitative improvements of the methods. The qualitative improvements were mainly related to making the techniques more compatible with the systems theory criteria, and the qualitative advancements comprised an estimation of relationship strengths. We gleaned additional findings and several future research directions, including suggested developments and further applications of the systems approach in rail accident analysis.

AB  - The significance and advantages of utilizing renewable energy sources are widely recognized. Upon examining past studies, it was revealed that there has been a lack of research on harnessing the waste energy from double-stage gas turbines powered by biomass-hydrogen hybrid fuel for polygeneration applications. Thus, a new configuration is proposed in the study for the multi-production of electricity, cooling, heating, and potable water. In the current research, a high-pressure turbine is driven by a combustion chamber fed by a biomass gasifier. Meanwhile, a low-pressure turbine is driven by a post-combustion chamber fed by hydrogen as fuel. The heat loss of the topping gas turbine cycle is recuperated by a supercritical Brayton cycle (SBC), a steam Rankine cycle (SRC), and a water heater. The waste heat of the supercritical Brayton cycle and steam Rankine cycle is recovered through an absorption refrigeration cycle and a thermoelectric generator, respectively. Thus, the heat loss of the topping system is completely recovered. The net power output of the gas turbine cycle is considered the electricity production of the system while the output power of the SBC and SRC is utilized in a reverse osmosis desalination system to produce potable water. The investigations conducted on the system are thermodynamic and exergy-economic assessments and three-objective optimization utilizing 5 gases (i.e., CO2, CO, Nitrogen, Air, and Helium) in the SBC. The final results reveal the superiority of Helium as the supercritical gas, bringing about an exergy efficiency (ηex) of 32.11 %, a total cost rate (C˙tot) of 103 $h−1, a payback period (PP) of 0.159 years, and a specific cost of polygeneration (cpoly) of 22.03 $GJ−1 for the system. Although the levelized cost of products of the configuration is high due to the freshwater production, ηex of the proposed system is higher than the previous systems based on a double-stage gas turbine cycle driven by biomass and hydrogen.

AB  - To cope with present energy and climate crises, maximization of energy use becomes essential. Maritime transport is the core of international trade and the majority of vessels are equipped with marine engines for propulsion and power generation. This paper provides an exhaustive state of the art review on enhancing efficiency technologies based in waste heat recovery and applicable to marine engines. A bibliometric analysis followed by a systematic review based on the PRISMA 2020 approach is presented in order to identify current used systems, not implemented but available technologies and non-explored heat sources. From a wide query on Scopus and Web of Science databases, 576 results were obtained for the bibliometric analysis. Further selection of the most relevant journal articles gave a total of 35 studies, 30 original articles and 5 reviews, for the in-depth analysis. As a result, the organic Rankine cycle was identified as the most common technique for waste heat recovery. Cold energy recovery was found to be an innovative strategy but limited to vessels with LNG facilities. Despite the low representation in scientific literature, thermoelectric generators appeared to be a promising direction for future research. The recovery of low-grade waste heat was identified as a promising gap on the knowledge.

AB  - Live VM migration has significantly gained attention as one of the most key strategies of improving data center efficiency through better resources allocation that leads to efficient services. The data center efficiency includes less power consumption, less unutilized resources, and less service interruption time in cases of maintenance or failures. The key point of the live VM migration is to copy the VM’s state, memory, and disk with the minimal downtime to guarantee less interruption in the services the VM provides. Pre-copy, Post-copy, and Hybrid-copy are examples of Live VM migration methods that copy the VM’s memory states to the destination host, while the VM still runs at the source host, as in the Pre-copy, or at the destination host, as in Post-copy. Each of these classical live migration methods has different characteristics and performance. Dynamic Hybrid-copy combines Pre-copy iterations with the Post-copy to have the best of both methods. In this paper, we present the mathematical model for the Dynamic Hybrid-copy live migration method for the total migration time, downtime, and total transferred data during the migration process. We compare the Dynamic Hybrid-copy with other classical live migration methods. We implement the models on JAVA and evaluate the performance of the Dynamic Hybrid-copy and compare it with other methods for different experimental parameters. Based on the performance results, we show how choosing the effective number of Pre-copy iterations leads to better migration performance. Mathematical models were also implemented in CloudSim and a simulation scenario was tested for the four migration methods.

Since its inception in the early 2000s, STAMP and its associated techniques, namely the System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and the Causal Analysis based on System Theory (CAST), have attracted increasing interest as suitable approaches for safety studies. Nonetheless, a literature review on their applications is lacking. This paper fills this gap via a scoping literature survey on contributions indexed in academic journals and conference proceedings. Through a systematic analysis of 321 eligible documents, this research presents a comprehensive examination of relevant features for STAMP, STPA and CAST since 2003, such as the system type and domain of analysis, coverage and completeness of the analytical and methodological steps, respectively, as well as alterations and/or enrichments of their original versions. The bibliometric findings from primary, secondary and non-empirical research contributions are discussed to critically reflect on the past and present of STAMP and its associated techniques, and possible future directions are highlighted.

The EARO algorithm was designed to meet specific load demands and economic metrics to promote sustainable energy solutions. By integrating wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, fuel cells, biomass generators, and inverters into a comprehensive HRES, the EARO algorithm effectively manages and allocates power, thus ensuring both cost reduction and reliability. Performance tests conducted using HOMER software compared EARO's efficacy against nine contemporary algorithms, demonstrating EARO's superior ability to optimize system configurations. EARO achieved a photovoltaic output of 2806.3399 kW, a wind turbine output of 597.2655 kW, and integrated 548.8034H2 storage tanks, collectively leading to an annual system cost of $3.0926 million and a total net present cost of $25.119 million, with a levelized cost of energy of $1.2196 per kWh. The optimized HRES achieves a 100 % renewable energy fraction with a balanced energy mix that significantly reduces operational costs and enhances the sustainability of on-site power generation. This makes EARO a critical tool for stakeholders and policymakers in renewable energy, especially for off-grid or remote applications. This study underscores the potential of EARO to drive the transition toward sustainable and autonomous energy systems.

AB  - Purpose
The construction industry is currently responding to pressures of industrialisation happening across all sectors. Consequently, offsite construction (OSC) has become a vehicle to achieve industrialisation. This requires changes in traditional construction processes resulting in possible changes in construction skill requirements. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to identify and review prevailing OSC practices and skills in the Australian construction industry. This study aims to critically analyse the existing skill profile classifications through a single case study and identify the need for an OSC specific skill classification.
Design/methodology/approach
This study follows a case study design, with an in-depth analysis of a single construction project. Only one case study was studied because scientifically, one example was enough to prove that the prevailing skill classifications do not represent OSC skills in a modern context. Data was retrospectively collected through semi-structured interviews of project stakeholders representing design, manufacture and assembly. Content analysis was conducted to analyse the collected data and produce findings.
Findings
This study identifies the inadequacy of the existing classification system, unavailability and the need of OSC specific skill categorisation. It highlights new skills that enter OSC; building information modelling engineer, three-dimensional draftsperson, OSC project manager and project coordinator, which are not identified in the available Australian skill classifications. These, together with existing skills need to be carved in to create a new skill classification.
Originality/value
This study is the first of its kind where a comprehensive OSC project is evaluated as a case study to determine OSC skill classification requirements in Australia.

AB  - Nanoparticles are emerging into powerful tools for biomedical applications. Several nanoparticles have been developed and evaluated for drug delivery applications. However, only a limited number of them have progressed into clinical trials. This is mainly due to the poor understanding of the fate of nanoparticles in complex physiological environments. Protein and peptide nanoparticles (PNPs) have emerged as powerful platforms for drug delivery applications. PNPs are versatile, self-assembling stable molecules with biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targetability. To harness their drug delivery potential effectively, we must design the nanoparticle with proteins and peptides for better targetability. This review outlines various types of protein and peptide nanoparticles, their preparation, advantages, and highlights of their research in drug delivery applications. We are also addressing the challenges involved in advancing PNPs from “bench to bedside.”

AB  - Optimal deployment of renewable and cleaner energy in power system operations has been the topic of interest to achieve deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. However, the intermittency of wind and solar power impedes the large-scale penetration of renewable power generation (RPG) into the power grid. Use of electrical energy storage (EES) facilities has great potential in mitigating the variability of RPG, and will allow reducing the power dependency on fossil fuel based generators (FFBG). Hybrid power systems (HPS) using both RPGs and FFBGs are an alternative means of dealing with variability problem. However, modelling different RPGs integrated with EES and FFBG in consideration of operational constraints, scheduling strategies, and other operational objectives is a challenging task. Previous research and review articles have mostly focused on the modelling, sizing, modes of operation and techno economic aspects of HPS and EES independently. However, no reviews specific to issues of various small scale to large scale EES integrated HPS operation have been published to date. This work presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments in six different EES + HPS and three hybrid EES facilities and underlines the different objectives, detailed real time operational analysis, and solution methodologies. The discussion covers the operation of HPS in both stand-alone and grid connected mode, and looks at the growing application of artificial intelligence (AI) based scheduling strategies for the evaluation of optimal HPS operational paradigms. The proposed review will strengthen the key directions for future research of EES integration and will provide the context for the development of economic, efficient and reliable cleaner power system.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is a central strategy to strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector over the next years. Nevertheless, there is a lack of common understanding of Industry 4.0 and tools to help companies’ transformation to Industry 4.0, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these research gaps, this study proposes a framework to characterise and evaluate Industry 4.0 scenarios to aid companies’ transition towards Industry 4.0. For this, a design science (multi-methodological) approach is adopted, including an Industry 4.0 use case survey, modelling and simulation and two proof-of-concept cases developed in collaboration with a Canadian college centre for technology transfer. The results indicate that the proposed framework can help companies identify Industry 4.0 scenarios more intuitively to assist project conception, portfolio selection and planning during Industry 4.0 roadmap development. Finally, the results of this study suggest that Industry 4.0 can be implemented incrementally while companies increase their digital capabilities and maturity.

AB  - Extensive research on nature-inspired cellular metamaterials has globally inspired innovations using single material and limited multifunctionality. Additive manufacturing (AM) of intricate geometries using multi-materials provides additional functionality, environmental adaptation, and improved mechanical properties. Recently, several studies have been conducted on multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) technologies, including multi-materials, methodologies, design, and optimization. However, in the past six years, very few or no systematic and complete reviews have been conducted in this research domain. This review intends to comprehensively summarize MMAM systems and the working principles of its fundamental processes. Herein, the Multi-material combinations and their design, modeling, and analysis strategies have been reviewed systematically. In particular, the focus is on applications and opportunities for using MMAM for several industries and postprocessing MMAM fabricated parts. Furthermore, this review identified the limitations and challenges of existing software packages, MMAM processes, materials, and joining mechanisms, especially at the multi-material interfaces. Finally, we discuss the possible strategies to overcome the aforementioned technological challenges and state the future directions, which will provide insights to researchers and engineers designing and manufacturing complex nature-inspired objects.

AB  - The construction industry contends with high injury rates, emphasizing the need for innovative preventive measures in construction health and safety (CHS). While previous studies have investigated the potential applications of virtual reality (VR) in the construction industry for different purposes, an in-depth study on VR in the CHS context is lacking. Hence, this study provides a state-of-the-art analysis of VR applications in CHS, employing a dual scientometric and systematic review approach. A scientometric analysis is conducted to examine annual publication trends, keyword co-occurrences, and science mapping of publication outlets, alongside mapping the contributions of leading countries in this domain. This analysis reveals a marked increase in research interest and identifies central thematic connections within the body of literature. The systematic review assesses VR technologies, including immersive, desktop-based, BIM-based, 3D game-based, and augmented reality, addressing their roles in hazard identification and safety training. The study also underscores challenges like infrastructure, content modeling, and interoperability and proposes directions for future research. Recommendations include probing into VR's role in cognitive safety risks and the impact of users' prior safety knowledge on learning outcomes. This study suggests that developing tailored VR experiences for specific user groups could significantly advance safety practices in the construction industry.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly becoming an important facet in the drive for attaining sustainable energy goals. However, EV sales still constitute only a small proportion of vehicles in most countries. The expansion of DC fast-charging network will facilitate a sustainable transportation revolution by offering end-user a versatile choice to charge EVs for longer journeys. Power converters play a significant role in the design and operation of EV charging stations. Modern technologies in charging stations are promising, where state-of-the-art research allows idle batteries or EVs to operate as distributed energy sources. However, it is always important to ensure input current harmonics and power factors are within the standard specification. Solid-state switch-mode power converters have reached a level of maturity with regards to the improvement in power quality and precisely regulating voltage levels during bidirectional power flow operation. This paper presents an exposition of EV charging systems, including incentives for development, structures, power converters, standards, industrial applications, and emerging trends. Furthermore, state-of-the-art technologies, including both academic and real-world EV charging technologies, have been carefully chosen, and a quantitative assessment of the technologies has been provided in this paper.

AB  - There is a wide range of literature on adopting ontology to solve construction problems, but no review of existing studies has systematically analyzed and visualized the trends in ontology research. This study reviews ontology research mainly published in the Scopus database from 2007 to 2017 with the combination of scientometric analysis and critical review. Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management”, and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling”, and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: “Domain ontology”, “Industry foundation classes”, “Automated compliance checking”, and “Building information modeling”. This review provides an in-depth understanding of existing ontology research and indicates the emerging trends in this research domain.

AB  - The industrial sector is a significant energy consumer amidst the ongoing energy transition to renewable energy resources. With the rising penetration of volatile renewable sources, the need for managed electricity consumption, i.e., demand-side management intensifies. However, the participation of incentivized programs is mostly limited to single consumers with a vast electricity consumption. Recent regulatory changes have allowed independent aggregators to participate in the reserve and ancillary market, enabling smaller end-users to contribute. With the numerous demand-side management contribution possibilities, including energy efficiency and demand-response measures, the objective of the study is to systematically categorize demand-side management applications across different industrial sectors and stages. Furthermore, the study aims to analyze interconnections between these objectives, which are predominantly addressed in isolation within the existing research literature. Highlighting the potential in industrial electricity consumption optimization contributes to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals 7, 9, and 13. To structure the application possibilities within the less-energy intensive industry, a systematic mapping study was conducted covering developments from 2012. An initial search was conducted on several literature databases, and structured selection and data extraction were applied. Cited and referenced studies were screened until no more relevant publications were found. Studies show a wide range of application possibilities and were structured and compiled into an application map. Trends show the increasing inclusion of storage devices in recent publications. Application of energy-flexible and energy-efficient objectives shows synergetic effects. A notable lack of studies focusing on ancillary markets within the less energy-intensive industries was discovered.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been rapidly transforming the landscape of natural sciences and has the potential to revolutionize the process of data analysis and hypothesis formulation as well as expand scientific knowledge. ML has been particularly instrumental in the advancement of cheminformatics and materials science, including membrane technology. In this review, we analyze the current state-of-the-art membrane-related ML applications from ML and membrane perspectives. We first discuss the ML foundations of different algorithms and design choices. Then, traditional and deep learning methods, including application examples from the membrane literature, are reported. We also discuss the importance of learning data and both molecular and membrane-system featurization. Moreover, we follow up on the discussion with examples of ML applications in membrane science and technology. We detail the literature using data-driven methods from property prediction to membrane fabrication. Various fields are also discussed, such as reverse osmosis, gas separation, and nanofiltration. We also differentiate between downstream predictive tasks and generative membrane design. Additionally, we formulate best practices and the minimum requirements for reporting reproducible ML studies in the field of membranes. This is the first systematic and comprehensive review of ML in membrane science.

AB  - Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of popular modern methods of construction (MMC) and pre-manufactured construction in the construction industry and propose a framework for future implications for practice and future research.
Design/methodology/approach
This technical paper is based on a narrative review of the extant literature on the subject. First, the Scopus search engine was used to retrieve relevant papers on MMC, offsite and pre-manufactured construction. Second, institutional literature such as reports by industry professional and trade bodies, literature from leading technology firms and contractors with experience of MMC were extracted. These two strands of literature were synthesised and a comprehensive discussion on the topic was provided.
Findings
Results show that journal publications on MMC and pre-manufactured construction have increased in the past decade. The paper found significant advances in the development of premanufactured and offsite construction approaches with many benefits. Offsite and pre-manufactured construction are viable and sustainable systems currently suitable for wider adoption as the mainstream construction method.
Research limitations/implications
This technical paper based on an integrative review of relevant literature could have benefitted from interviews of professionals with experience of offsite and pre-manufacture techniques and from wider availability of current academic publications on the subject. Validation of the framework has not been undertaken.
Originality/value
Not much-published work has been undertaken on the current state of development globally and the viability of these construction approaches. This paper evaluates evidence from academic and industry sources to address this gap. A framework has been developed which can help the industry’s industrialisation drive.

AB  - For cooling operations where the hot fluid temperature must be reduced to the ambient temperature or even below the ambient temperature, cooling water from cooling towers cannot be used. Chillers are used to provide chilled water that is considerably below ambient temperature for these cooling operations. Chillers are heat pumps that reject heat from a cold source to a hot sink. The most common type of chiller is the compression chiller that is based on the Carnot cycle. A refrigerant travels through the compression chiller cycle composed of four unit operations: expansion, evaporation, compression proper, and condensation. The required chilled water supply temperature and the condensation cooling medium return temperature bind the refrigerant maximum and minimum temperatures in the cycle. The refrigerant must exist as liquid and vapor at the cycle maximum and minimum temperature and pressure values. In its turn, the refrigerant type and the refrigerant cycle tempeature range define the compressor lift. Other alternatives to generate chilled water are absorption chillers and steam jet refrigerators.

AB  - Precast concrete buildings (PCB) offer several advantages, including swift construction, exceptional quality, enhanced durability, decreased formwork requirements, and reduced labour. However, it is crucial to effectively study the connections between the various prefabricated elements that make up the structure, particularly in the face of dynamic loads and seismic actions. Extensive research has been conducted to develop seismic-resistant PCB, underscoring the necessity of exploring research approaches, identifying trends, addressing gaps, and outlining future research directions. A thorough analysis was carried out on a literature set comprising 127 articles published between 2012 and May 2023, using a three-step research process that included bibliometric search, quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis. The primary objective was to identify prevailing research trends and pinpoint current gaps that would contribute to the advancement of future research. The scientific mapping of authors' keywords revealed the correlation between PCB and topics such as dry connections, energy dissipation, optimal design, and progressive collapse, highlighting the diverse nature of current research in the field. Furthermore, the qualitative literature analysis demonstrated that frame and shear wall systems emerged as the predominant categories. This dominance can be attributed to the seismic performance reference being the traditional cast-in-place building approach. Nonetheless, this study brings attention to several notable research gaps. These gaps include the necessity to explore innovative, resilient structural systems in greater detail and the requirement for adopting state-of-the-art methodologies that facilitate decision-making processes in integrating PCB seismic safety and sustainability. This study provides a roadmap for future research projects and reports on the latest developments and trends in seismically safe PCB research.

AB  - The Last Planner System (LPS) is a production planning and control system based on Lean Construction (LC) principles. Effectively implementing the LPS in the construction industry remains challenging, impeding the realization of LC principles. Automation of planning and control in the LPS has gained attention to address this challenge. However, research exploring the state-of-the-art of such automation and its impacts on realizing LC principles is still lacking. Therefore, this study performed a systematic literature review of 112 relevant studies, identifying 50 functionalities and associated benefits of automation across six LPS stages, with the lookahead planning stage having the maximum functionalities. Analyzing their interactions with LC principles revealed that automated planning and control in the LPS can support achieving ten LC principles. Future research directions are suggested in areas such as constraint management, knowledge reuse, dynamic replanning, and construction workforce training.

AB  - In recent years, the hype around Digital Twins (DTs) has been exponentially increasing in both industry and academia. DTs are a potential solution to increase automation and advance towards Smart Manufacturing. Manufacturing DTs have been implemented at different hierarchical levels, ranging from system of systems to unit level. Increasing computational capacity and data exchange rates can enable DT implementations for real-time applications. Several literature reviews on manufacturing DTs have been published. However, no previous paper focuses on manufacturing DTs at the unit level for which real-time control is most applicable. Simultaneously, the challenges to engineer DTs with real-time capabilities are enormous, both from a scientific and technological perspective. Therefore, we focus on DTs of single production units such as traditional machine tools, additive manufacturing machines and advanced robotic applications. In this systematic literature review, 96 papers about practical unit level DT applications found in the Scopus database using a combination of the keywords “Digital Twin”, “Production” and “Manufacturing” are reviewed. We summarize how DTs are currently implemented and operated, and what potential benefits DTs offer at the unit process level in four categories: generic reference models, services, DT content (models and data) and DT deployment (hardware and software). Following the thematic analysis, an overall discussion, summary of key contributions and identified research gaps, and outlook into future research avenues is given. Key findings of this review can be summarized as: focus on DT components versus being holistic; need to share data and models across multiple stakeholders; lack of physical fidelity of the models; stark contrast of lab scale developments and real world testing, e.g., historical data and storage related challenges; lack of clear definition of DT in industry, and missing semantic interoperability between a wide variety of domains.

AB  - Service-based business models have attracted growing interest as means to capture sustainable value. There is still unclear terminology and lack of understanding on how servitization can locate sustainability as central value. The purpose of this study is to consolidate the terminology and methods for servitization, to identify factors and elements that contribute to a sustainability perspective. The followed methodology includes a comprehensive literature review, further analyzed through a conceptual framework using an evidence-based approach. The findings of this study will clarify existing terminologies and frameworks while supporting the development of service-based business models that avoid the sustainability paradox of servitization.

AB  - Context
This paper reviews cultural-historical activity theory's (CHAT) contribution to interprofessional learning and practice (IPLP) in healthcare. The intent is to allow greater access to the concepts and the empirical knowledge accumulated by scholars who have utilized CHAT, thereby facilitating deeper engagement with CHAT in study designs.
Methods
A meta-ethnographic study was conducted to take stock of the literature. Eight major databases and two specific journals were searched for IPLP studies that utilized CHAT. Full-texts were coded and analyzed in consultation with procedures outlined by Noblit and Hare.
Results
34 full-texts from 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in a wide spectrum of care settings, disciplines, and involved a myriad of healthcare professionals. The studies contributed to the empirical CHAT literature by fulfilling four types of research purposes: providing foundations; specifying mechanisms; developing interventions; and projecting the future. Organization of IPLP was characterized by contradictions brought about by concomitant demands of expansion and alignment of object motives; and reining in and unbridling of systems.
Conclusion
Scholars of IPLP utilizing CHAT will benefit from greater deliberation in their choice of context and concept in research inquiries. Novel juxtapositions of concepts and context can stimulate the development of creative notions.

AB  - Background
As the gaming industry grows around the world, playing pervasive games is becoming an important mode of entertainment. A pervasive game is one in which the game experience extends into the actual world or where the fictive world of the game merges with the physical world. How pervasive games can adapt to the ever-changing nature of technology and design in current society requires a comprehensive review.
Objective
In this systematic review, we aimed to measure and analyze 4 dimensions of pervasive games through development, technology, experience, and evaluation. Moreover, we also aimed to discover and interpret their relationship with game, interaction, experience, and service design.
Methods
We first chose 3 well-known databases, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO, and searched from 2013 to April 2022. A strictly thorough Boolean search for research keywords such as “pervasive game,” “design,” and “interactive” resulted in 394 relevant articles. These articles were identified, screened, and checked for eligibility to find valid and useful articles, which were then categorized and analyzed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method.
Results
The systematic selection was finally left with 40 valid and valuable articles. After categorization and analysis, all articles were classified according to 4 main themes, which were design and development (11/40, 28%), interaction and technology (15/40, 38%), users and experience (9/40, 23%), and evaluation and service (5/40, 13%). These 4 main areas can be subdivided into several smaller areas.
Conclusions
In the 4 areas of game design, interaction design, experience design, and service design, many scholars have studied pervasive games and made contributions. Although the development and technology of pervasive games have evolved with the times, there is still a need to strengthen emerging design concepts within pervasive games.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic expedited the growing rate of reliance on telehealth, as it provided a safer option for patients to seek the care they need and avoid potential negative consequences of being exposed to the COVID-19 virus. The aim of this study is to develop a series of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)-based leading indicators to proactively analyze and evaluate the user interface in telehealth and virtual visits. Building on Nielsen's usability heuristics and mapping them to the six aspects of quality of care introduced by the Institute of Medicine, we identified the design features that had the highest impact on the quality of care and developed a list of leading indicators for each feature. Further, we developed corresponding checklists for each leading indicator to evaluate the features of the user. Beyond the benefits of telehealth for both patients and healthcare providers during atypical circumstances, the changes prompted by the COVID-19 public health emergency have possibly altered the position of telehealth to the point that communicating through video and audio has become the new normal. Therefore, the importance of designing an interface to facilitate user interaction with the system and consequently with one another is of utmost importance.

AB  - Improving process safety is a high priority in process and manufacturing industries to address unwanted accidents and process disruptions. Research into the applications of dynamic simulators for hazard analysis has been rapidly growing. However, there is scant discussion in literature regarding the benefits and limitations associated with the utilization of dynamic simulations for process hazard analysis. A fundamental systems conceptualization, underpinned by the P3 model of people, plant and procedures, provides a framework for the characteristics to be considered by subject matter expertise when identifying the affordances and limitations within a dynamic simulation used for process hazard analysis. This subject matter expertise includes people with operations, process engineering, process safety and process simulation experience. All dynamic simulations will have limitations and understanding the affordances and limitations is crucial for the correct use of a model and the interpretation of results. A case study is presented on the application of a systematic approach for interrogating the dynamic simulation from an industrial operator training simulator of an operating residue catalytic cracking complex with the aim of conducting failure mode and effects analysis by identifying the significant consequences and the associated independent protection layers. Issues with respect to how one could automate the analysis rather than use human observation to assess the outcomes are considered and how to present the outcomes to complement existing process hazard analysis techniques are discussed. Future research requirements and developments that may assist in practically and effectively applying the technique in industry are also discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing technologies allow increasing the throughput and quality of manufacturing systems, bringing to the rise of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The aim is to leverage the ICT technologies to achieve a flexible customised production with reduced time while avoiding resources waste. In this framework, Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) concept plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the minimisation of defects and errors in industry processes by trying to act at the first time properly. Due to its importance, this topic has received greater attention during the last two years by the technical literature. Given the increasing number of research works and the several approaches suggested by researcher interested into the topic, this study aims at providing a literature overview of the current trends in the ZDM field from 2018 to 2020. The focus of the work is to provide a state-of-the-art about ZDM strategies, i.e. Detection, Repair, Prediction and Prevention, by analyzing the related most significant works, thus providing a single-strategy analysis and the corresponding most frequently used methods. A brief bibliometric study corroborates the general research patterns and the relevant aspects emerging from each single-strategy analysis. Finally, based on the conducted study, we point out the shortcomings present in the current technical literature to target the future research directions in the ZDM field.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency held an international two-day workshop in June 2018 to deliberate possible performance targets for non-regulatory fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) air sensors. The need for a workshop arose from the lack of any market-wide manufacturer requirement for documented sensor performance evaluations, the lack of any independent third party or government-based sensor performance certification program, and uncertainty among all users as to the general usability of air sensor data. A multi-sector subject matter expert panel was assembled to facilitate an open discussion on these issues with multiple stakeholders. This summary provides an overview of the workshop purpose, key findings from the deliberations, and considerations for future actions specific to sensors. Important findings concerning PM2.5 and O3 sensors included the lack of consistent performance indicators and statistical metrics as well as highly variable data quality requirements depending on the intended use. While the workshop did not attempt to yield consensus on any topic, a key message was that a number of possible future actions would be beneficial to all stakeholders regarding sensor technologies. These included documentation of best practices, sharing quality assurance results along with sensor data, and the development of a common performance target lexicon, performance targets, and test protocols.

AB  - In the highly competitive era of the maritime and fisheries sectors, the implementation of electric and hybrid propulsion systems in fishing vessels is becoming increasingly relevant. This study aims to review recent advancements in the application of electric or hybrid propulsion systems in fishing vessels. The method used to obtain publication references involved the use of VOSviewer, which functions as an additional tool for examining and displaying publication trends according to authors and keywords. The analysis shows that although some fishing vessels have adopted electric or hybrid propulsion systems, there is still a lack of understanding of the full benefits of this technology. According to recent studies, using environmentally conscious propulsion systems on fishing vessels has the potential to significantly reduce the release of greenhouse gases and improve operating efficiency. Therefore, future research is expected to fill this gap by exploring the potential application of state-of-the-art technology in the development of more efficient and sustainable fishing vessel propulsion systems. In this way, the fishing industry can make a greater contribution to achieving carbon neutrality and sustainability goals in the future.

AB  - Empty storage shelves and long customer lead times due to a sharp rise in market demand from industries on the one hand (e.g., pharmaceutical products). On the other hand, increasing short-term working or unemployment due to a rapid decline in demand (e.g., automotive). Current supply and demand gaps caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remind us that successful competition in volatile business environments requires rapid adjustments of production capacities. Capacity management (CM) addresses these adjustments by adapting production capacity to market demand. Operations managers of flexible manufacturing systems can adjust the capacity by using various levers (e.g., overtime, used machines, …). To guide these managers, decision support systems (DSS) exist for short-term CM (e.g., shop floor scheduling). However, due to complexity and runtime problems, the decision-making process for medium-term CM is usually carried out with low technical support. Increases in computing power and advances in algorithm performance over the past decades have enabled Machine Learning to solve ever more complex problems such as the aforementioned issues. Reinforcement Learning (RL) in particular has shown good performance in solving short-term CM problems when compared to humans or other established heuristics. In this work we review the current literature for CM using RL in flexible manufacturing systems. We identify an existing lack of knowledge within the overlap of medium-term CM and RL. However, good performance of RL in short-term CM indicates that an application in medium-term CM should be evaluated. In addition, we propose a concept of a method for medium-term CM based on RL to support operations managers in the decision-making process. The resulting DSS could have a significant impact on production performance, especially in terms of capacity adjustment speed.

AB  - The concept of Simplexity has emerged several times in many discourses within different scientific domains: it somehow refers to the intertwined nature of Simplicity and Complexity. To the eye of the scientist beholder, any of these contributions renders different facets. None of those is negligible nor seems to be superior. Starting from this consideration, this paper uses a recent Design Science Research based method to develop a conceptual artefact allowing the entire realm of Complexity Sciences to unravel the Complexity of Simplexity. By moving through an in-depth systematic literature review, this research mined the nuances of Simplexity's meaning from several different research domains throughout seventy years, and then distilled those nuances. The resulting conceptual artefacts are possibly useful any time there is the need for dealing with Complexity – from the design of cyber-socio-technical systems to the analysis of protein networks – paving the way for a shared language for Psychologists, Neuro-linguists, Designers, Resilience Engineers, Biologists, and other Complexity Scientists.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity challenges, focusing on the still growing phenomenon of 'smishing', within the legislative context. In particular, it explores the legal landscape of cybercrime through the lens of Poland's recently enacted Act on Combating Abuses in Electronic Communication, as well as the European Union's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade. The first one serves as a significant case study for examining legislative efforts aimed at mitigating cybersecurity risks in the field of electronic communications. The article describes the multi-layered, collaborative business-state approach of the Polish law, which can provide a solid framework for addressing current and future cyber security threats. The act stands as a promising tool for fortifying national cybersecurity infrastructure and could serve as a useful example for other jurisdictions grappling with similar issues. The law also engages citizens actively in its cybersecurity initiatives, promoting collective responsibility. In the broader European Union context, while the Polish Act undergoes scrutiny, this analysis also seeks to explore its alignment with the objectives outlined in the 2020′s European Union's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade. This examination aims to evaluate the extent to which the Polish legislative framework resonates with the overarching goals set forth by the European Union, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the synergy between national initiatives and the broader European cybersecurity strategy context.

Machine learning software defect prediction is a promising field of software engineering, attracting a great deal of attention from the research community; however, its industry application tents to lag behind academic achievements.
Objective:
This study is part of a larger project focused on improving the quality and minimising the cost of software testing of the 5G system at Nokia, and aims to evaluate the business applicability of machine learning software defect prediction and gather lessons learnt.
Methods:
The systematic literature review was conducted on journal and conference papers published between 2015 and 2022 in popular online databases (ACM, IEEE, Springer, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). A quasi-gold standard procedure was used to validate the search, and SEGRESS guidelines were used for transparency, reporting, and replicability.
Results:
We have selected and analysed 32 publications out of 397 found by our automatic search (and seven by snowballing). We have identified highly relevant evidence of methods, features, frameworks, and datasets used. However, we found a minimal emphasis on practical lessons learnt and cost consciousness — both vital from a business perspective.
Conclusion:
Even though the number of machine learning software defect prediction studies validated in the industry is increasing (and we were able to identify several excellent papers on studies performed in vivo), there is still not enough practical focus on the business aspects of the effort that would help bridge the gap between the needs of the industry and academic research.

AB  - Urban water infrastructure (UWI) plays a critical role in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) by providing safe drinking water, sanitation, and wastewater management, and contributing to sustainable cities. However, UWI faces significant challenges, including the high cost of failure in the face of devastating natural disasters increasingly caused by climate change. Many current infrastructures, built years ago, are not adapted to climatic changes, posing a threat to both UWI functions and the SDGs they support. To address these challenges, this study critically reviews recent research on UWI performance under climate change conditions, the impacts of climate change on long-term sustainability, and potential adaptation strategies. The present study suggests that incorporating the effects of climate change and sustainability criteria into UWI is essential. The results also reveal that severe flooding and water shortages are the most significant impacts of climate change on urban water infrastructure. Furthermore, the effects of other climate parameters, such as temperature rise due to the global warming phenomenon, should not be underestimated.

AB  - This paper aims to enhance the understanding of Industry 5.0 by introducing an innovative AI-based methodology that proficiently maps employer expressions related to well-being using job postings. This process involves creating a comprehensive dictionary of well-being expressions, which is then compared with existing academic literature. This approach facilitates empirical well-being analysis from employers’ perspectives. Bridging theoretical and practical realms, we offer valuable insights to academia and industry about well-being (human-centricity) interpretation by employers. The findings highlight UK employers’ prioritisation of self-realisation and a positive work atmosphere to attract job seekers. Nonetheless, many vacancies do not explicitly emphasise well-being to attract potential workers.

AB  - Motivated by challenges in the motor manufacturing industry, a solution to reduce computation time and improve minimisation performance in the context of optimisation of battery electric vehicle powertrain is presented. We propose a cascade optimisation method that takes advantage of two different vehicle models: the proprietary YASA MATLAB® vehicle model and a Python machine learning-based vehicle model derived from the proprietary model. Gearbox type, powertrain configuration and motor parameters are included as input variables to the objective function explored in this work while constraints related to acceleration time and top speed must be met. The combination of these two models in a constrained optimisation genetic algorithm managed to both reduce the amount of computation time required and achieve more optimal target values relating to minimising vehicle total cost than either the proprietary or machine learning model alone. The coarse-to-fine approach utilised in the cascade optimisation was proven to be mainly responsible for the improved optimisation result. By using the final population of the machine learning vehicle model optimisation as the initial population of the following simulation-based minimisation, the initial time-consuming search to produce a population satisfying all domain constraints was practically eliminated. The obtained results showed that the cascade optimisation was able to reduce the computation time by 53% and still achieve a minimisation value 14% lower when compared to the YASA Vehicle Model Optimisation.

It necessitates the use of monitoring and object detection technologies to ensure system safety in excavation systems. Given the increased investment and speed of improvement in technologies, it is necessary to review the types of technology available and how they contribute to excavation system safety. A systematic literature review was conducted which identified and classified the existing monitoring and object detection technologies, and introduced essential enablers for reliable and effective monitoring and object detection systems including: 1) the application of multisensory and data fusion approaches, and 2) system-level application of technologies. This study also identified the developed functionalities for accident anticipation, prevention and response to safety hazards during excavation, as well as those that facilitate learning in the system. The existing research gaps and future direction of research have been discussed.

AB  - Industry 4.0, growing material supply chains, and changing logistics structures require flexible material flow solutions. As a result of this development, the usage of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) is increasing significantly. Although there has been much research undertaken on the design of indoor AMRs, there is a lack of research regarding outdoor systems. Weather and road conditions are still challenging for sensors and actuators. Furthermore, requirements regarding the system, which must be known and met beforehand to guarantee industrial applicability, are yet to be sufficiently determined. This paper aims to close this gap and identify functional requirements through Axiomatic Design, which is used to develop design guidelines for practitioners. Starting with a systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews, the authors gather basic customer requirements. These customer requirements will then be analyzed to define functional requirements. Through a mapping and top-down decomposition process, the research team deduces design solutions for using outdoor AMRs. These requirements and solutions will be transformed into guidelines, which help system designers to improve the implementation of AMRs on the factory premises.

AB  - The integration of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) into industrial processes and multi-generation systems presents a promising solution for recovering low-grade waste heat. This study explores the use of such waste heat in producing green hydrogen, utilizing TEGs as an alternative medium for energy recovery. The hydrogen production methods examined include proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers and alkaline electrolyzers. The heat sources are categorized into geothermal sources, solar energy sources, and general waste heat sources. By incorporating TEGs into hybrid systems, the overall system efficiency and rated power output, as well as green hydrogen production, are significantly enhanced. For instance, a system combining an organic Rankine cycle powered by a geothermal source with a TEG and a PEM electrolyzer can generate 98.37 kg/day of H2 and produce 6781 kW of power, achieving an exergy efficiency of 55.39 %. Additionally, TEGs are employed in hydrogen storage and liquefaction to improve the efficiency of the compression and liquefaction processes by reutilizing waste heat. To provide a comprehensive overview, a bibliometric study using the VOSviewer tool is conducted to highlight the trends in hydrogen production via TEGs, analyzing authors' keywords and index keywords. Moreover, this study presents innovative methods and insights into the efficient recovery and utilization of waste heat for green hydrogen production, emphasizing the potential of TEGs in advancing sustainable energy solutions.

In this work, we give a brief review of the state of the art and then present challenges and future directions in this exciting area. The biggest driver is the rapid improvement in computer technology which greatly increases the number of factors that can be considered during the design process. Thus, some of the key future directions lie in integrating the design process with other aspects of process systems engineering, such as scheduling, planning, control, and supply chain management. In addition, sustainability is now a major consideration. The tools available to address these challenges are limited but we are in a position to develop them based on strong chemical engineering principles following a multidisciplinary approach with contributions from other disciplines including biology, biochemistry, computer science, materials, and chemistry.

For these applications, high specific weight of the metallic hydrides has an added value, as it allows counterbalancing of a vehicle with no extra cost. Improving the rates of H2 charge/discharge in MH on the materials and system level, simplification of the design and reducing the system cost, together with improvement of the efficiency of system “MH store-FC”, is in the focus of this work as a joint effort of consortium uniting academic teams and industrial partners from two EU and associated countries Member States (Norway, Germany, Croatia), and two partner countries (South Africa and Indonesia). The work within the project is focused on the validation of various efficient and cost-competitive solutions including (i) advanced MH materials for hydrogen storage and compression, (ii) advanced MH containers characterised by improved charge-discharge dynamic performance and ability to be mass produced, (iii) integrated hydrogen storage and compression/refuelling systems which are developed and tested together with PEM fuel cells during the collaborative efforts of the consortium.

Although machine-learning-based surrogate models (SMs), one of the many AI approximation strategies for higher-order models, have long been utilized in sophisticated optimization studies in various fields, their reliability in the field of sustainable and low-energy architectural design is now being extensively explored. To comprehend the effectiveness of applying state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted optimization methodologies for building energy performance, this study presents a comprehensive review of recent studies aimed at identifying innovative theories and critical factors for each component of the optimization process. Considering passive form and envelope design variables, seventy-two relevant studies from the Scopus database were selected for review after screening. The results, including the current trends for surrogate modeling and optimization methods, accuracy levels of SMs, extent of building performance improvement, and decisive building design variables, are thoroughly discussed according to the varying conditions of each study. Finally, a further discussion of recent methodological advancements and limitations can help identify potential approaches and challenges for future research.

AB  - Several strategies have been detected in the extant literature to understand how Circular Economy (CE) can be pursued. Considering all the End-of-Life (EoL) management practices detected, disassembly processes have been identified as strategic. However, only scattered attempts have explored how digital technologies (specifically, simulation) can support the CE adoption, by focusing on disassembly processes. This research detects, through a systematic literature review, how so far simulation approaches have been proposed and applied in the extant literature to foster the disassembly process with a focus on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). At this purpose, the main roles played by simulation to ease the disassembly process, also through the support of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, have been detected. Based on the results obtained, two roles of simulation to support the disassembly process (Sequence planning and process optimization and Training) seem the most interesting from the twofold CE/I4.0 perspective, combining up to date technologies with traditional simulation approaches. Discussed in a deeper and sector-independent way, results provide directions about the lifecycle phases to be explored through simulations, the technologies to be involved, and both the final purpose and the type of simulation approach to be adopted. Finally, the gaps needing for further contributions, raised from the adoption of a Digitized Disassembly, are listed, and the main technologies so far employed to cope with them, through a Virtual/Augmented Disassembly-oriented Simulation perspective, have also been detected and provided as a guide for those who want to approach the hybrid simulation/disassembly research context.

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.

AB  - Context:
The aim of statistical causal inference (SCI) methods is to estimate causal effects from observational data (i.e., when randomized controlled trials are not possible). In this context, Pearl’s framework based on causal graphical models is an approach that has recently gained popularity and allows for explicit reasoning about issues related to spurious correlations.
Objective:
Our primary goal is to understand to which extend and how Pearl’s graphical framework is applied in software engineering (SE).
Methods:
We performed a systematic mapping study and analysed a total of 25 papers published between 2010 and 2022.
Results:
Our results show that the application of Pearl’s SCI framework in SE is relatively recent and that the corresponding research community is fragmented. Most of the selected papers focus on software quality analysis. There is no clear and widespread community of practice (yet) on how to implement and evaluate SCI in SE.
Conclusions:
To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a mapping study is done. We believe that SE practitioners might benefit from such a work, as it both provides an overview of the work and people involved in the application of causal inference methods, but also outlines the potential and limitations of such approaches.

AB  - In today's highly competitive and interconnected global market, economic achievement and prosperity are essential needs for every individual. However, in recent years, the “science of sustainability” has gained popularity due to mounting evidence of the damaging impacts of environmental issues. Lately, the expansion of petroleum industries and refineries has led to a substantial rise in the production of refinery oily waste. The treatment of such waste presents significant environmental challenges, necessitating the development of sustainable solutions. This review explores the latest advancements in biological processes for treating it, focusing on their efficacy and limitations. These processes are still facing challenges such as slow degradation rates, nutrient availability, and pollutant toxicity, which can hinder efficiency. To address these, efforts are being made to develop more viable biological treatments including exploration of microbial strains, optimizing process conditions, bioreactor systems, and integrating advanced bioremediation techniques. Potential applications of these processes across different contaminated sites are discussed along with commercially available technologies. Drawbacks related to bioprocess scale-up, cost-effectiveness, and regulatory constraints are also addressed. Additionally, it incorporates pertinent case studies that serve as illustrations of successful implementations of biological strategies. Ultimately, this sets the stage for practical bioremediation implementation as a solution for refinery waste management.

AB  - Classic cars hold substantial value in the automotive industry, and the restoration process plays a pivotal role in increasing their worth. Ensuring the certification of these restoration processes is vital, as is keeping owners well-informed about the ongoing procedures taking place in their appreciated vehicles. By monitoring and controlling these restoration activities, the management of classic car workshops can effectively optimize their operations, empower owners with pertinent information, and preserve the authentic nature of these vintage automobiles. This study aims to develop a digital twin system for a classic car bodywork restoration shop workshop. The latter integrates multiple sensor technologies, including location tracking, humidity and temperature sensing, accelerometer monitoring, and smart plugs, to facilitate the identification of ongoing activities of classic car bodywork restoration process instances. By leveraging these sensors, the digital twin system may simulate and control workshop operations more effectively. We perform a systematic rapid review of related work and, based on state-of-the-art practices, we identify existing architectures and software applications used for creating digital twin systems. Then, we propose the architecture for our digital twin system, detailing its functionalities. We aim at contributing to advancing digital twin technology in classic car bodywork restoration, enhancing its authenticity, and fostering improved management practices, and overall experience for classic car owners.

AB  - Background
Recent advances in signal processing technology and computational power have increased the attention towards computer vision-based techniques in diverse applications such as agriculture, food processing, biomedical, and military. Especially in agricultural and food processing, computer vision can replace most of the manual methods for screening of seed, grain and food quality.
Scope and approach
The objective of present study is to review the recent advancements in computer vision techniques for predicting quality of various raw materials and food products. This review paper is focused on the quality determination of grains, vegetables, fruits, beverages, meat, sea food and edible oils using Digital Image Processing (DIP). Several studies have reported the successful applications of DIP techniques for feature extraction, classification and quality prediction of foods. DIP algorithms are used to extract the significant features from images which are further used as input for machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify them based on different criteria. These feature extraction methods have been improved by Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Features can be automatically extracted by DL algorithms resulting in higher accuracy. DL algorithms require huge data management and computational resources which can be a major limitation.
Key findings and conclusion
A significant literature is available for quality estimation of food products by using computer vision algorithms, but they lack commercial exploitation. Android based applications have not yet been developed for this specific purpose. User friendly, low cost and portable devices equipped for quality estimation would be helpful for rapid quality measurement of food products in real time.

AB  - The rise in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) introduced by OEMs has increased the demand for modern vehicle sophistication. This sophistication involves a variety of software capabilities and functionalities embedded in over 100 ECUs in a vehicle. This has led to the need for over-the-air (OTA) updates. OTA updates can be delivered wirelessly, eliminating the need to bring vehicles to the garage for updates. This is more convenient for owners, reduces costs for OEMs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. There exist different OTA update considerations that are adopted by automotive OEMs, such as the Uptane framework, Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA-DM) standard, and the general ISO 24089 standard, including subvariance of Uptane and OMA-DM. However, the systematic implementation of security-by-design applying ISO 21434 in OTA systems is less employed, and there remains a gap in this practice of security-by-design that the automotive industry can adapt to ensure a systematic approach to secure OTA update technology. OTA update security hinges on identifying vulnerability pathways for potential malicious attacks. Therefore, identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities throughout the OTA update process is critical for robust security. This paper proposes an adaptable security-by-design approach to OTA update, built and extended from our work Iyieke et al. (2023). The adaptable security-by-design approach is then applied to a developed prototype OTA update system based on the Uptane framework as implemented by Toradex. Security-by-design is a well-established concept in enterprise systems, but is still developing in the cyber–physical system of automotive cybersecurity. Our proposed approach covers the security engineering lifecycle, the logical security layered concept, and the security architecture. A threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) is performed based on the international automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434. The highest threats identified from the TARA are formalized, and corresponding mitigation actions are defined according to UNECE WP29. Penetration testing is conducted to verify the approach’s capability to reinforce the security of the OTA update systems against some of the identified risks and threats. Our proposed approach provides a systematic and adaptable security-by-design approach to ensure secure OTA updates in modern vehicles; OEMs and other stakeholders can use it to develop secure OTA systems regardless of the OTA update technology used.

AB  - While Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to transform business models and enable novel service propositions, it also ushers in intricate managerial challenges. To comprehend AI’s disruption as well as harness its potential, we conducted a developmental review of 92 scholarly works centred on financial auditing, the chosen professional service domain. Drawing on the corpus of literature, we applied the Technology Affordance and Constraints Theory (TACT) to dissect the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces to professional services. Our analysis led to conceptualising AI’s affordances and constraints for individual practitioners, firms, and professional associations within the auditing domain. Subsequently, we compared these with the affordances and constraints of typical non-AI, classic IT tools in the same domain, highlighting the disruptive essence of AI. Our findings further revealed the reciprocal and tensional relationship between AI affordances and constraints, where actualising AI affordance at the firm level may impose constraints on individual practitioners. Based on our findings, we argue for integrating AI into decision-making by practitioners, propose a dynamic view of task automation and augmentation for firms, and urge an AI-calibrated knowledge system for professional associations. This study contributes to both theory and practice, laying the foundation for a more nuanced discourse on the strategic significance of harnessing AI in professional services.

AB  - Arduino, an open-source electronics platform, has become the go-to option for anyone working on interactive hardware and software projects. An Arduino board (such as the Uno) connected to a breadboard with plugins such as inputs, sensors, lights, and displays can be controlled by a code written in the Arduino development environment. How to achieve this is by prototyping with Arduino. Prototyping with Arduino has grown in popularity with the increased use of the Arduino platform. Prototyping with Arduino, however, is not an easy task for nonprogrammers with interest in the field. With increased public interest in the field will come a need for accessible information. This paper presents a methodical literature review intended to intensively analyze and compare existing primary studies on prototyping with Arduino. We found about 130 of such studies, all peer-reviewed and published within the last 15 years, including these years (2015–2020). These studies were tediously and carefully chosen through a three-step process. In this paper, a cautious analysis of selected studies was followed by a clear description of the methods applied. The methods were categorized according to the success rate of the studied prototypes. Results obtained can be used in researches on the best technique to adopt while prototyping with Arduino. They can also be used in electronics researches and by individuals who wish to obtain a guide on prototyping with Arduino despite lacking grounded knowledge of the subject matter.

AB  - Joint efforts and interdisciplinary approach are proper means to face the issue of global warming. An adequate response should be to employ state of the art scientific knowledge for the technology advancement, as well as for fostering new scientific insights. Together with resource efficiency, circular economy is getting in focus of researchers and consequently policymakers. Sustainable development is a multidisciplinary topic and interaction of energy, water and environment systems plays one of the central roles. Within the paradigm of circular economy, there is growing need for system integration where a by-product of one system can represent resource for the other. This review is dedicated to the 12th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Sysmems, and discusses some latest developments in three main areas of sustainability themes: (i) Energy, (ii) Water and (iii) Environmental Systems. Examples of circular economy approach have been emphasized which improve economic efficiency of the whole chain and further decrease environmental burden, enabling cleaner production. Although integrative concept of energy, water and environmental systems is coming in the research focus, more effort is necessary for further integration of those systems, whereby increased complexity is going to be handled only by multidisciplinary, intersectoral scientific cooperation.

Increasingly, a firm’s innovation capability has become one of the key frontiers of competitive advantage. The Lean philosophy has a well-proven reputation for its focus on process efficiency and effectiveness, and therefore, is often applied in various areas of innovation. Such wide and ever-increasing applicability also has resulted in an incoherent corpus of literature on Lean innovation. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize an integrative view on Lean innovation management.
Design/methodology/approach
Based on a systematic literature review, the key Lean principles and practices useful in the context of innovation management are identified and synthesized into an all-inclusive framework. By means of three illustrative cases (i.e. public hospital, electronics company and avionics manufacturer), this paper elaborates on how the proposed framework can be applied.
Findings
A total of 88 publications are analyzed, leading to 34 Lean principles and practices relevant to innovation management, which are further integrated into a comprehensive model, dubbed the “Leanovation” framework.
Originality/value
This study is the first attempt to advance the understanding of various interrelated and interdependent components of Lean innovation management in a holistic way.

AB  - This chapter is focused upon use of the three major families of thin-film solar cell (TFSC) materials for space applications: amorphous silicon (a-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS). Clearly, there are distinct advantages to be realized through use of thin III-V and perovskite hybrid materials for photovoltaics (PV) for space power generation. However, studies of inorganic TFSC materials have yielded several potential space applications as well as numerous scientific and technological insights over the past 50 years. A short discussion of the difference between space (air mass zero, AM0) and terrestrial (AM1.0 or AM1.5) solar radiation begins the chapter. After contrasting crystalline and TFSCs, we explore the key components of TFSC devices; performance and technical challenges of the main inorganic absorber materials are then considered. We examine, in context, several unique stressors in the space environment, varying with location, that challenge TFSC devices. Thermal issues in space, including cycling and thermal load, are more extreme than those encountered by terrestrial installations; other issues include atomic oxygen and various types of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, and cosmic rays). Device structure(s), including mass specific power and processing details, as well as testing relevant to use of TFSCs for space missions are examined. A brief summary of past, present, and future applications for space exploration concludes the chapter. Finally, we highlight several examples of technology transfer to other PV devices and related technologies.

AB  - Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a large-scale government project – the Social Credit System – aiming to rate every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness, monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks, and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of scoring, as they would qualify as “high-risk AI systems”, which are authorised while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory. Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based scoring.

The search was conducted in the following databases: LILACS, Medline (Pubmed), CRD, The Cochrane Library, Trip Medical Database and Google Scholar. ELISA and PCR assays were adopted as reference methods. Thirty-four articles were included in this systematic review. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Forest Plot were performed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity for each parameter analyzed (NS1, IgM and IgG). The results revealed that the combined analysis of the IgM antibody with the NS1 antigen resulted in greater sensitivity than the isolated analysis of IgM. The three analytes together showed the best performance, with a combined sensitivity of 90 % (95 % CI: 89–92 %) using ELISA as a comparator. Thus, the present review provides relevant knowledge for decision-making between the available rapid diagnostic tests.

AB  - The next-generation systems are expected to be largely cyber–physical systems (CPSs) that autonomously control physical processes, through sensors and actuators typically in real-time feedback and cooperative control loops distributed among physical and cyber environments. The rapid technological advancements enhance the smartness of these CPSs, pushing their boundaries of performance and efficiency by embedding new information and communication technologies. However, to what extent CPSs should be smarter so that they do not compromise safety and security of safety critical systems? is an open research question. Towards this goal, the purpose of this study is to establish a grounded theory to analyse what makes these systems smart? and eventually, how to find a balance between smartness and safety risks? In this precinct, this article aims to develop a conceptual framework, define the dimensions and derive the characteristics that make CPSs smart. The proposed approach combines an automated informetric and systematic analysis of literature pertinent to the topic of smartness across anthropology, science, engineering and technology. The analysis of a case study building and the discussions presented herein support the connection between the existing understanding of CPSs and smartness offered by the building design approach in urban environment.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been widely used in various manufacturing industries, and VR-based virtual manufacturing has received significant attention in the current intelligent manufacturing era. Digital human models (DHMs) are essential for virtual manufacturing applications. Additionally, researching new applications of DHMs has developed into an important academic research field. This paper aims to identify the applications and research trends of DHMs in the manufacturing industry and to provide a reference for the continued development of virtual manufacturing and DHMs. We selected a total of 49 related articles from a large number of articles published between 2014 and 2019. The applications of DHMs in the manufacturing industry are analyzed from different perspectives and various relevant technical limitations are discussed. The results indicate that the applications of DHMs differ significantly between different types of fields. The automotive industry is the main application field for DHMs, and assembly/maintenance simulations and evaluations are the main application types. Additionally, there are still some limitations in the establishment of virtual environments, motion control, and DHM evaluation that should be addressed. Finally, research trends in the application of DHMs are illustrated and discussed, including the planning and assessment of human-robot collaboration systems, the combination of DHMs and augmented reality, and improved motion planning for DHMs. In summary, the application of DHMs can improve the realism and effectiveness of virtual manufacturing, and DHMs will be more widely and deeply studied and applied in various manufacturing industries in the near future.

AB  - The production of charcoal briquettes was based on the concept of utilizing waste for sustainable and eco-friendly solutions within the green economy. This study introduces a new approach for optimizing important properties of charcoal briquettes. The approach aims to determine the appropriate operating conditions using a hybrid method. It integrates a novel TOPSIS linear programming with genetic algorithms based on response surface methodology. The experiment used an optimal mixture ratio of 25:10:6, including coconut shell, bagasse ash, and corncob. The results of the responses showed increased heating value and burning time by 5.13 % and 5.71 %, respectively, and moisture content decreased by 15.12 %. Furthermore, confirmation experiments within a 95 % confidence interval verified that the three responses obtained at the optimal operating conditions of process factors. The total cost of charcoal briquettes is 0.903 USD/kg and a payback period of 4.85 years. This illustrates that process improvement also aligns with the broader goals of promoting green and a circular economy.

AB  - ABSTRACT
E-commerce growth as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic was only expected to occur by 2025–2030. Online shopping increased in intensity and diversity. At the same time, retailers diversified their operations and opened online channels, also in sectors that previously showed reluctance to make this shift. These evolutions resulted in an expansion of household freight in terms of volume, geography, and organisation. Hence, half a decade of innovation in the e-commerce sector was needed in the span of two years. This manuscript summarises the repercussions for household freight since the pandemic's start. Given that interactions between consumers, retailers, and logistics service providers drive the e-commerce system, this manuscript combines these different literatures into a holistic framework, going beyond traditional siloed research on last-mile logistics, retail strategies, or online shopping behaviour. We found that logistics has come to the forefront: logistics service providers now need to provide tailored services and come in direct contact with consumers. As a result, we need (i) to gain insights into the new geography and dynamics of household’s freight origins and destinations; (ii) use this to re-examine existing relationships between consumer, retailer, and logistics service provider, and; (iii) assess the impact of more demanding consumers on the sustainability of the overall system.

AB  - Industrial heat production is responsible for around 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. To achieve the climate change goals defined in the Paris Climate Agreement, the EU commission has shifted its focus on sustainable means to generate heating. Moreover, global dependencies are leading to a re-organization of natural gas supplies. Therefore, there is a need for less vulnerable and less price-volatile solutions for heating. This paper focuses on two decarbonization technologies for industrial process heat supply: a) electricity-driven steam-generating high-temperature heat pumps (HTHP), a technology that is more efficient than fossil fuel boilers in generating steam, and b) solar parabolic trough collector (PTC), which can produce heat economically and at a minimal carbon footprint compared to other technologies. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the levelized cost of heat (LCOH) of these technologies to fulfill a comparative techno-economic analysis. A maximum PTC collector's solar fraction limit (SFlimit) is defined to indicate when the LCOH for these two technologies is equal. This allows for distinguishing between the economic stronghold of each technology. The evaluation is carried out through the annual energy simulations using TRNSYS and Excel spreadsheets for HTHPs, while TRNSED and OCTAVE are used for the solar thermal part. Boundary conditions for European geographical constraints have been applied to establish use cases for the analysis. The result shows that the design of a PTC system with optimal SF can reach cost parity with HTHP for most of the analyzed locations. The developed methodology serves as a valuable guide to quickly determine a preferred lower carbon heat solution, thus easing the decision-making for industries.

AB  - Hybrid energy storage systems integrate diverse storage technologies to enhance system performance, efficiency, and longevity. Despite a plurality of proposed energy management strategies to operate these systems and a significant number of reviews on this topic, the field lacks a systematic, actionable and reusable summary of available energy management strategies. Therefore, we conducted a meta-review of available review articles to ascertain a joint base for representative energy management strategies for hybrid energy storage systems. In subsequent reviews of each determined class, we extracted, defined, and detailed core concepts, which were then implemented in Python for demonstration and analysis. We identified four representatives: filter-based, deadzone-based, fuzzy-logic-based, and model-predictive-control-based energy management. Each one is discussed with its operational mechanisms and implementable equations and is illustrated through simulations. Notably, we excluded machine-learning-based candidates due to the limited foundation and generalizability in the current literature. With the identified representatives, we seek to provide a foundation and framework for further development, including quantitative assessments of energy management performance in various configurations. Also, this work facilitates targeted and effective enhancements in energy management development for each class, accelerating future research and supporting industry stakeholders to develop more efficient renewable energy systems. To allow easy reuse and reproducibility, the source code is available at GitHub.

These have been widely investigated and used since early human history for the treatment of numerous diseases. Nowadays, major concerns lie in the efficacy, safety, and quality of phytotherapeutics. Therefore, it is crucial to develop reliable and reproducible methods that guarantee accurate and precise results in the identification and quantification of phytochemicals under a quality assurance/quality control. In this context, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has gained popularity due to its improved separation and detection. This chapter provides an overview on the determination of phytochemicals, from characterization and quantification, with special emphasis on method validation and the analytical quality parameters. The main techniques used for their analysis (mainly chromatographic, spectroscopic, electrochemical procedures) are described. Also, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography is proposed as an attractive method for their quali–quantitative determination.

AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0, cognitive ergonomics is crucial for improving the working conditions and the psychosocial well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart machines, as well as for the enhancement of production performances. Nevertheless, this topic is often neglected or ignored when implementing human-robot interaction in industrial settings. Starting from the results obtained from previous studies, this work proposes a structured process to develop and preliminarily validate a set of guidelines to support non-experts in human factors at the early stages of the design of human-centered and collaborative applications. A systematic analysis of the scientific literature has been performed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers to identify relevant results on the topic. Successively, the guidelines have been developed starting from such an analysis by considering the target group and the final aim of the work. This phase involved the analysis, classification, summary, and abstraction of relevant statements and results from the selected articles, as well as the update of the previous set of guidelines. The guidelines have been preliminarily validated by an external team of researchers currently doing research in the field. Qualitative feedback on understandability and relevance has been collected to improve the guidelines before further investigations.

KW  - Automated design information extraction
AB  - Construction cost estimation is a labor-intensive task that involves several processes. Although some of these processes have been automated, construction cost estimation still relies heavily on manual inputs. To compute a cost estimate, an estimator needs to: (1) take off quantities and extract some required cost information from the architectural model or drawing; (2) extract other required cost information from the construction specifications; (3) assign building elements to work or cost items; and (4) retrieve the unit cost of the work or cost items to further compute the cost estimate. To achieve full automation of construction cost estimation, the manual inputs required to classify building elements, and to retrieve pricing information of work items need to be automated. To address that, the authors proposed a new method that uses semantic modeling and natural language processing techniques in developing algorithms that automate the manual processes involved in: (1) extracting design information from construction specifications; (2) using the extracted information to match specified material in the construction specifications with items from an established database; and (3) retrieving the pricing information of the materials specified in the construction specifications. To test the validity of the authors' proposed method, an experiment was conducted using eight wood construction projects in Detroit, MI. The proposed method was utilized to develop an algorithm that can process the construction specifications automatically and retrieve the unit cost of materials from a database. The results from the developed algorithm were compared with the gold standard (results manually generated by industry experts). The developed algorithms achieved 99.2% precision and 99.2% recall (i.e., 99.2% F1-measure) for extracted design information instances; 100% precision and 96.5% recall (i.e., 98.2% F1-measure) for extracted materials from the database. The authors demonstrated that as the training data increases, the performance levels increase. The developed algorithms utilized 5.56% of the time it took using the current traditional method of extracting design information from construction specifications manually. These results showed that the proposed method is promising in developing algorithms that automate the processing of construction specifications to extract the design related information in fulfilling essential information requirements of detailed wood construction cost estimation and in retrieving the unit costs.

AB  - Bottom-up energy system models are often based on hourly time steps due to limited computational tractability or data availability. However, in order to properly assess the rentability and reliability of energy systems by accounting for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, a higher level of detail is necessary. This study reviews different methods for increasing the temporal resolutions of time series data for global horizontal and direct normal irradiance for solar energy, and wind speed for wind energy. The review shows that stochastic methods utilizing random sampling and non-dimensional approaches are the most frequently employed for solar irradiance data downscaling. The non-dimensional approach is particularly simple, with global applicability and a robust methodology with good validation scores. The temporal increment of wind speed, however, is challenging due to its spatiotemporal complexity and variance, especially for accurate wind distribution profiles. Recently, researchers have mostly considered methods that draw on the combination of meteorological reanalysis and stochastic fluctuations, which are more accurate than the simple and conventional interpolation methods. This review provides a road map of how to approach solar and wind speed temporal downscaling methods and quantify their effectiveness. Furthermore, potential future research areas in solar and wind data downscaling are also highlighted.

AB  - Relocatable modular buildings (RMBs) are gaining recognition for their innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, especially in addressing urgent needs during natural disasters or pandemics. Their inherent flexibility, mobility, and scalability enable rapid deployment and adaptation to changing needs. However, managing multiple modular units and their relocation and reconfiguration over time presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a digital twin framework that integrates building information modeling (BIM), the internet of things (IoT), and geographic information systems (GIS) to enhance facility management for RMBs. Through a detailed case study of a relocatable modular school system, the framework's application is illustrated, showcasing its ability to streamline lifecycle management of modular construction, from initial design and fabrication to deployment, operation, and reconfiguration. The results highlight the potential of digital twin technology in fostering more sustainable, efficient, and resilient modular building environments, contributing to the evolution of smart construction practices and adaptive architecture

AB  - With the pressing Climate Change challenges, passive design strategies are seen as vital for reducing energy consumption in buildings and to address the negative impact of buildings on the natural environment. This work present a novel approach by establishing weighted values for each passive design strategies to be investigated using questionnaire for residential buildings in hot climates. A bibliometric analysis and an extensive literature review of hot climate-based studies that address the effectiveness of passive building measures was conducted. Climate Consultant software was used to conduct a comprehensive overview of the existing passive practices to control energy consumption while providing thermal comfort for buildings’ users. Three main criteria have been derived to address all aspects of passive design: environmental design, building design, and building construction factors. Sub-criteria for the categories were developed for subjective and objective evaluations. A questionnaire was distributed among 36 academic experts and practitioners of varying professional experiences. Criteria’s weighted values were determined using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), specifically the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) using Expert Choice software. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyze the results. The findings suggest that factors "Thermal insulation," "Building orientation/openings," and "Window shading devices" are among the top-rated with priority weight of 6.7%, 6.4%, and 6.1%, respectively. . It is recommended that these passive design strategies be optimized as a common practice in conjunction with design components.

AB  - Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature on Lean Six Sigma (LSS) for services, construct a morphological analysis (MA) framework and identify research gaps to point to future research possibilities and priorities.
Design/methodology/approach
The MA framework is based on literature review of 175 papers published from 2003 to 2015, across 67 journals recognised by Scopus or ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide 2015. A three-phased methodology is used by the authors, with Phase1 featuring a five-stage systematic review protocol to identify relevant journal papers for review; Phase2 presenting a framework for classifying the reviewed papers in terms of their fundamental, methodological, chronological and sector-wise orientations; and Phase3 constructing an MA framework on the classified papers and identifying the research gaps.
Findings
The MA framework constructed based on six dimensions, namely, organizational context of applications, desired outcomes, implementation systems, LSS tools and techniques, integration with other management philosophies and evaluation methods, involving 40 focused themes, has revealed 355 distinct research gaps as opportunities for future research.
Practical implications
This paper confirms the existence of substantial scope and points to specific topics for further research in the area of LSS for services. The findings demonstrate the gaps in academic research on the subject. In addition, the study also helps organisational leaders and practitioners to look at LSS from a holistic perspective in the services context.
Originality/value
The MA framework of the existing literature on LSS for services presents a unique, systematic effort to identify research opportunities. In addition, a five-stage systematic review protocol is proposed in this paper. This could be valuable to researchers and practitioners in enabling them to systematically review the literature on research subjects of interest to them.

AB  - In the last three years, the number of active photovoltaic installers in Brazil has increased from approximately 1,600 to 14,200. These installers are promoting the photovoltaic growth in distributed generation. However, the Net Metering practiced in Brazil will reduce benefits, impacting the future success of photovoltaic installers' businesses. Also, many of these companies have few years of experience, and are still adjusting technical operations. So, this article aims to develop a competitive business model for evaluating the photovoltaic installers' performance in the Brazilian energy market. We select 72 business items and surveyed 548 photovoltaic installers in Brazil. We organized and discussed the information into the Business Model Canvas. We observed that some companies are not competitive in large-scale photovoltaic plants compared to foreign companies operating in Brazil. However, the market trends we found point to future business opportunities for large photovoltaic plants in condominiums, cooperatives, or the free market. The competitive Business Model Canvas helps installers look at their business, positioning themselves more assertively in the Brazilian market. Besides, the Business Model Canvas can serve as a benchmarking tool for comparing businesses among installers of different countries, promoting the company's processes evolution. Consequently, it contributes to the photovoltaic customers' satisfaction.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining significant attention in various fields to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. AI can be particularly beneficial in enhancing decision-making processes for complex and ill-structured problems that lack transparency and have unclear goals. Most AI algorithms require labeled datasets to learn the problem characteristics, draw decision boundaries, and generalize. However, most datasets collected to solve complex and ill-structured problems do not have labels. Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies. To this end, we examine existing AI paradigms, mainly symbolic AI (SAI) guided by human domain knowledge and data-driven AI (DAI) guided by data. We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE). I-AIDE is utilized to identify product defects and extract the voice of customers to help managers make decisions to improve quality and enhance customer satisfaction.

AB  - Background
In recent epochs, the field of critical medicine has experienced significant advancements due to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, AI robots have evolved from theoretical concepts to being actively implemented in clinical trials and applications. The intensive care unit (ICU), known for its reliance on a vast amount of medical information, presents a promising avenue for the deployment of robotic AI, anticipated to bring substantial improvements to patient care.
Objective
This review aims to comprehensively summarize the current state of AI robots in the field of critical care by searching for previous studies, developments, and applications of AI robots related to ICU wards. In addition, it seeks to address the ethical challenges arising from their use, including concerns related to safety, patient privacy, responsibility delineation, and cost-benefit analysis.
Methods
Following the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review to delineate the breadth of research in this field of AI robots in ICU and reported the findings. The literature search was carried out on May 1, 2023, across 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Eligible publications were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts. Publications that passed the preliminary screening underwent a comprehensive review. Various research characteristics were extracted, summarized, and analyzed from the final publications.
Results
Of the 5908 publications screened, 77 (1.3%) underwent a full review. These studies collectively spanned 21 ICU robotics projects, encompassing their system development and testing, clinical trials, and approval processes. Upon an expert-reviewed classification framework, these were categorized into 5 main types: therapeutic assistance robots, nursing assistance robots, rehabilitation assistance robots, telepresence robots, and logistics and disinfection robots. Most of these are already widely deployed and commercialized in ICUs, although a select few remain under testing. All robotic systems and tools are engineered to deliver more personalized, convenient, and intelligent medical services to patients in the ICU, concurrently aiming to reduce the substantial workload on ICU medical staff and promote therapeutic and care procedures. This review further explored the prevailing challenges, particularly focusing on ethical and safety concerns, proposing viable solutions or methodologies, and illustrating the prospective capabilities and potential of AI-driven robotic technologies in the ICU environment. Ultimately, we foresee a pivotal role for robots in a future scenario of a fully automated continuum from admission to discharge within the ICU.
Conclusions
This review highlights the potential of AI robots to transform ICU care by improving patient treatment, support, and rehabilitation processes. However, it also recognizes the ethical complexities and operational challenges that come with their implementation, offering possible solutions for future development and optimization.

AB  - Air source heat pumps are an excellent electric alternative to fossil fuel based heating systems for reducing residential greenhouse gas emissions, but common mild climate systems suffer significant performance losses at the low outdoor air temperatures experienced in regions with cold climates. Improved heat pumps for cold climates are available on the market, but they are more expensive and their adoption to date has been relatively low, suggesting that there is work yet to be done in this field. This paper presents an analysis of market-available air source heat pumps identifying and discussing the cold climate technologies found in residential centrally-ducted cold climate systems. It shows that all of these heat pumps use rotary or scroll type variable-speed compressors, accumulators, and reverse cycle defrosting, and that a small number also include refrigerant injection and/or specialized refrigerant charge management devices. Available performance data for these heat pumps reveal that most of these systems still exhibit a significant loss of heating capacity at cold temperatures and are unlikely to meet the entire heating needs of a home in regions where temperatures drop below −15°C, necessitating the use of auxiliary heating systems. A review of the literature on cold climate heat pumps is also included to highlight additional design concepts and innovations that have not yet been implemented by the industry, but might further improve the performance and uptake of heat pumps in cold climates.

AB  - Cyber–Physical Systems are increasingly complex and frequently integrated into modern societies via critical infrastructure systems, products, and services. Consequently, there is a need for reliable functionality of these complex systems under various scenarios, from physical failures due to aging to cyber attacks. However, the development of effective strategies to restore disrupted cyber–physical infrastructure systems continues to be a major challenge. Even though there have been an increasing number of papers evaluating recovery planning in cyber–physical infrastructures networks, a comprehensive literature review focusing on mathematical modeling and optimization methods is still lacking. Thus, this study critically analyzes the literature on optimization techniques for recovery planning of cyber–physical infrastructure networks after a disruption, to synthesize key findings on the current methods in this domain. A total of 152 relevant research papers are reviewed following an extensive assessment of all major scientific databases. The main mathematical modeling practices and optimization methods are identified for both deterministic and stochastic formulations, categorizing them based on the solution approach (exact, heuristic, metaheuristic), objective function, and network size. Having identified the gaps, a set of future trends for both the methodology and application of optimization algorithms is presented. Overall, there is a need to shift toward scalable optimization solution algorithms, empowered by data-driven methods and machine learning algorithms, to provide reliable and computationally efficient decision-support systems for decision-makers and practitioners.

AB  - Conventional synthetic refrigerants are responsible for ozone depletion and have high global warming potential (GWP). Thus, countries across the globe are progressively phasing out such refrigerants by 2050 under the Kigali amendment. While the developed countries in Europe are the pioneers in promoting the use of low GWP refrigerants, the developing countries are still lagging. This is happening despite these countries being a signatory to the Kigali amendment. However, it is contextual to mention here that the refrigeration industry in developing countries, such as India, faces several barriers to the adoption of low GWP refrigerants. The phasing out of high GWP refrigerants will be considerably delayed if these issues remain unresolved, and there is inadequate research on such barriers to the adoption. With an aim to investigate the precincts of limited adoption, this study identifies 18 barriers through an extensive literature survey. It also contributes to the literature by proposing two more factors responsible for the limited adoption of low GWP refrigerants in the Indian context. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) methodology is used to elucidate the hierarchical relationship among these barriers. Lack of government incentives emerges as the most compelling factor limiting the adoption of low GWP refrigerants. The research also suggests a four-pronged strategy to promote the adoption of low GWP refrigerants in India.

AB  - Contemporary manufacturing must prioritise the sustainability of its manufacturing processes and systems. Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) focusses on minimising waste of any kind using data-driven technology, hence enhancing the quality of all manufacturing aspects (product, process, service, etc.). Making things right on the first try is the central tenet of ZDM. In recent years, the application of automation for in-line quality inspection systems has begun to attract the interest of both practitioners and academics because of its capability to detect defects in real-time, and thus adapt the system to disturbances. In this work, we provide a systematic review of the literature on current trends in the application of automation for in-line quality inspection with the ultimate objective of achieving ZDM. Additionally, bibliometric and performance analyses have been performed to gain a complete picture of the field. In this work, we have collected bibliometric data from the most widely referred search engines for academic engineering papers, i.e. Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Explorer, involving a total of 145 academic publications from 2011 to 2021. Uniquely for this study, we used three research attributes for the analysis of the selected articles, that is, the level of automation, the condition for quality inspection, and the contribution to ZDM dimensions. The literature suggests that there is a lack of research on the use of in-line detection data for the prediction of defects or repair. Based on the results and our interpretation of the literature, an adapted framework of ZDM (Psarommatis et al., 2020a) and multi-layer quality inspection (Azamfirei et al., 2021a) is presented.

AB  - 5G is the fifth generation of cellular networks. It enables billions of connected devices to gather and share information in real time; a key facilitator in Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It has more capabilities in terms of bandwidth, latency/delay, processing powers and flexibility to utilize either edge or cloud resources. Furthermore, 6G is expected to be equipped with the new capability to converge ubiquitous communication, computation, sensing and controlling for a variety of sectors, which heightens the complexity in a more heterogeneous environment This increased complexity, combined with energy efficiency and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements makes application of Machine Learning (ML) and distributed ML necessary. A decentralized approach stemming from distributed learning is a very attractive option compared with a centralized architecture for model learning and inference. Distributed ML exploits recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology advancements to allow collaborated ML, whilst safeguarding private data, minimizing both communication and computation overhead along with addressing ultra-low latency requirements. In this paper, we review a number of distributed ML architectures and designs, that focus on optimizing communication, computation and resource distribution. Privacy, information security and compute frameworks, are also analyzed and compared with respect to different distributed ML approaches. We summarize the major contributions and trends in this area and highlight the potential of distributed ML to help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions on selecting the right ML approach for 5G and Beyond related AI applications. To enable distributed ML for 5G and Beyond, communication, security, and computing platform often counter balance each other, thus, consideration and optimization of these aspects at an overall system level is crucial to realize the full potential of AI for 5G and Beyond. These different aspects do not only pertain to 5G, but will also enable careful design of distributed machine learning architectures to circumvent the same hurdles that will inevitably burden 5G and Beyond network generations. This is the first survey paper that brings together all these aspects for distributed ML.
