Objective
This systematic review assessed the effects of tooth-borne (TB), tooth-bone-borne (TBB) and bone-borne (BB) micro-implant assisted rapid maxillary expansion (RPE) on airway dimensions and function in young children and adolescents (10- to 17-years-old).
Materials and methods
Unrestricted search in 5 electronic databases until June 6th, 2020 was undertaken. This was supplemented with search in 6 additional resources for published, unpublished and ongoing trials up. Randomized (RCT) and non-randomized (Non-RCT) prospective studies that assessed the influence of the mini-screw-assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) approach on airway and breathing in young children and adolescents were included. Two reviewers performed the study selection and data extraction blindly and in duplicate by two authors while disagreements. A random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI), I2 and Chi2 tests were done. ROBINS-I, Cochrane Risk of Bias and GRADE tools were used. Reporting of this review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Results
Overall, 518 articles were retrieved; only 3 studies (2 RCT and one non-RCT) met the inclusion criteria. Both TB RPE and BB RPE improved on a short-term basis the dimensions of the airway, though the difference was not significant (P>0.05). TBB RPE significantly improved nasal airflow [(Mean difference (MD) 52.7 cm3/s, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 9.0–96.4), P=0.020)], reduced nasal resistance (MD −0.20Pa/cm3, 95% (−0.38)–(−0.02), P=0.028), and changed respiratory muscle strength variables (P>0.05). No correlation was found between the anatomical dimensions of the airway and the functional airway parameters (P>0.05).
Conclusions
The short-term airway volumetric changes secondary to MARPE were not significant. The influence of MARPE appliances on breathing is still not clear. Registration PROSPERO database (CRD42020183340).

AB  - Bone mineral density (BMD) can be measured at multiple skeletal sites using various technologies to aid clinical decision-making in bone and mineral disorders. BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has a critical role in predicting risk of fracture, diagnosis of osteoporosis, and monitoring patients. In clinical practice, DXA remains the most available and best validated tool for monitoring patients. A quality baseline DXA scan is essential for comparison with all subsequent scans. Monitoring patients with serial measurements requires technical expertise and knowledge of the least significant change in order to determine when follow-up scans should be repeated. Prior ISCD Official Positions have clarified how and when repeat DXA is useful as well as the interpretation of results. The 2019 ISCD Official Positions considered new evidence and clarifies if and when BMD should be repeated. There is good evidence showing that repeat BMD measurement can identify people who experience bone loss, which is an independent predictor of fracture risk. There is good evidence showing that the reduction in spine and hip fractures with osteoporosis medication is proportional to the change in BMD with treatment. There is evidence that measuring BMD is useful following discontinuation of osteoporosis treatment. There is less documentation addressing the effectiveness of monitoring BMD to improve medication adherence, whether monitoring of BMD reduces the risk of fracture, or effectively discriminates patients who should and should not recommence treatment following an interruption of medication. Further research is needed in all of these areas.

AB  - Microbial metabolomics focuses on the analysis of intracellular or extracellular primary metabolites, signaling molecules, hormones, and secondary metabolites, and it is an important field in systems biology. The progress in microbial metabolomics has been slow primarily due to the complexity and diversity of microbial metabolites, which are usually difficult to identify. However, with the rapid development of novel analytical techniques, microbial metabolomics has attracted increasing attention because it not only elucidates the network of various metabolic pathways, but also expounds the mechanisms underlying the interactions between microbes and hosts. This review discusses the current state of the art novel technologies, including instrument platforms, sample preparation methods, and data handling and analysis tools and resources for microbial metabolomics. In addition, we also describe the recent applications and challenges associated with microbial metabolomics.

AB  - Models are important tools to integrate ecological and socio-economic knowledge to better understand and manage social-ecological systems. Challenges include, among others, the adequate representation of feedback loops between the socio-economic and the ecological subsystems, uncertainties and human behaviour. To analyse how well models are able to address these challenges in the fields of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management the present paper systematically reviews recent mechanistic models of the field and analyses them with respect to a number of binary criteria. The reviewed models generally contain quite a few of the above-mentioned system features but still fall short when it comes to the adequate representation of the socio-economic dimension. Sorting the models by the labels given to them by their authors, such as “ecological-economic” or “system-dynamic”, allows assessing model variation within and among labels and indicates that there is a fruitful level of diversity in the models.

AB  - Summary
The classical psychedelics (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and mescaline exert their psychedelic effects via activation of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (5-HT2AR). Recent clinical studies have suggested that classical psychedelics may additionally have therapeutic potential for many neuropsychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, migraine and cluster headaches, drug abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this study, we investigated the pharmacology of 41 classical psychedelics from the tryptamine, phenethylamine, and lysergamide chemical classes. We profiled these compounds against 318 human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to elucidate their target profiles, and in the case of LSD, against more than 450 human kinases. We found that psychedelics have potent and efficacious actions at nearly every serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptor. We quantified their activation for multiple transducers and found that psychedelics stimulate multiple 5-HT2AR transducers, each of which correlates with psychedelic drug-like actions in vivo. Our results suggest that multiple molecular targets likely contribute to the actions of psychedelics.

AB  - The International Business Review (IBR) is a leading international academic journal in the field of International Business (IB). Such leadership is reflected in the large number of publications that grow year after year and particularly in the large number of citations received from other journals of high academic prestige. The aim of this study is to conduct a bibliometric overview of the leading trends regarding the journal’s publications and citations since its creation in 1992 until 2016. The work identifies the authors, universities, and countries that publish the most in IBR by mainly using the Scopus database though eventually complemented with Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. It also analyzes the most cited papers and articles of the journal. Besides, the study graphically maps the bibliographic material by using the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer software. In order to do so, the work uses co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence of author keywords. The results show the prominent European profile of the journal where contributors from European universities and countries are the most productive ones in the journal. Particularly, British and Scandinavian universities obtain the most remarkable results. However, mostly scholars from North America, but also from Oceania and East Asia are increasingly and regularly publishing in the journal. In addition, IBR is very well connected to other leading journals in the field, such as the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) and the Journal of World Business (JWB), as well as with other top management journals, thus demonstrating its core position in IB research conducted worldwide.

AB  - With advances in technologies, data science techniques, and computing equipment, there has been rapidly increasing interest in the applications of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges resulting from the evolving business and organisational operations in logistics and supply chain management (SCM). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the development and applications of RL techniques in the field of logistics and SCM. We first provide an introduction to RL methodologies, followed by a classification of previous research studies by application. The state-of-the-art research is reviewed and the current challenges are discussed. It is found that Q-learning (QL) is the most popular RL approach adopted by these studies and the research on RL for urban logistics is growing in recent years due to the prevalence of E-commerce and last mile delivery. Finally, some potential directions are presented for future research.

AB  - Summary
Dual-state emission (DSE), the emission of organic molecules in solution and solid state, has recently drawn interest for advanced performance materials. Here, we report conjugated compounds 1 and 2 with good photoluminescence (PL) in solution (ΦPL = 0.53 and ΦPL = 0.43) and exceptional emission in the solid state (ΦPL = 0.92 and ΦPL = 0.84). These donor-π-acceptor-π-donor (D-π-A-π-D) compounds with rotary components adopt different highly emissive states, according to our PL measurements. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations indicate that the PL changes are facilitated by polarizable moieties, with the possibility of trapping in the higher energy S2 state and anti-Kasha emission in viscous solutions. Complementarily, the flexibility and symmetry (or the lack thereof) of each molecule play a critical role in producing strongly fluorescent twisted structures in the solid state.

In her prose piece ‘Proshchatel’’ (‘The Forgiver’), from Zhivye kartiny (Tableaux vivants), Barskova employs autobiography as an element of critique, invoking and renovating Russian modernist precedents. In so doing, she shapes a new kind of autobiographism which has commonalities with American confessional poetry and theorizing of identity.

AB  - Pre- and post-migration experiences predispose high-risk immigrants and refugees to elevated risk of food insecurity and negative mental health status. With a significant increase in the occurrence of these challenges in high-risk immigrant populations and the evidence for a syndemic interaction, the need for reasonable efforts and evidence-based interventions to effectively address food insecurity and mental health issues. Such studies could focus on exploring the reinforcing connections between food insecurity and mental health trends. As an initial step to filling in this knowledge gap, we conducted a review of existing literature to explore the commonalities in food security and mental health trends in studies of high-risk immigrants. A systematic search in four major databases (MEDLINE-OVID, CINAHL, Academic Plus, and PubMed) identified 22 relevant articles. A synthesis of these articles identified different subgroups of high-risk immigrants including pregnant women, refugee parents, women immigrants and newcomer youth that experience increased risk of mental health and food insecurity challenges, which are associated with the pre- and post-migration contexts. The experiences of political, social and other environmental violence in countries of origin are traumatic experiences embodied by most high-risk immigrants. On arrival in destination countries, immigrants experience systemic and social barriers that also influence their mental health and food security status. However, access to culturally familiar foods is associated with improved health and wellbeing. Among high-risk immigrants, food, particularly culturally familiar foods are viewed as a symbolic vehicle and a representation of home. When culturally familiar foods are accessible, there is improved mental health status reflected in the ability of immigrants to share their cultures and identity while rebuilding their social networks and enhancing a sense of belonging. Efforts to effectively address food insecurity and mental health challenge in high-risk immigrants require a deep appreciation and understanding of the place and community-based factors and the available resources relevant to the unique needs and experiences of the high-risk immigrant populations.

AB  - An integral application of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 in the job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) must contemplate the automation and autonomy of the involved decision-making processes as a goal, which is the main purpose of the smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS) paradigm. In a real production context, uncertainty acts as a barrier that hinders this goal being met and, therefore, any SMS model should integrate uncertainty generators in one way or another. This paper proposes an ontological framework that identifies and structures the entities shaping the joint domain formed by the job-shop scheduling process in its itinerary toward the SMS paradigm, the sources of uncertainty that it faces, and the interrelationship type that link these entities. This ontological framework will serve in future research as a conceptual basis to design new quantitative models that, from a holistic perspective, will address the stochasticity of manufacturing environments and incorporate the management of disturbances into the realtime resolution of automatic and autonomous job-shop scheduling.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of automated psychological profiling systems, specifically applying machine learning to the field of deception detection. Several psychological studies and machine-based models have been reporting the use of eye interaction, gaze and facial movements as important clues to deception detection. However, the identification of very specific and distinctive features is still required. For the first time, we investigate the fine-grained level eyes and facial micro-movements to identify the distinctive features that provide significant clues for the automated deception detection. A real-time deception detection approach was developed utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning approaches to model the non-verbal deceptive behavior. Artificial neural networks, random forests and support vector machines were selected as base models for the data on the total of 262,000 discrete measurements with 1,26,291 and 128,735 of deceptive and truthful instances, respectively. The data set used in this study is part of an ongoing programme to collect a larger dataset on the effects of gender and ethnicity on deception detection. Some observations are made based on this data which should not be interpreted as scientific conclusions, but pointers for future work. Analysis of the above models revealed that eye movements carry relatively important clues to distinguish truthful and deceptive behaviours. The research outcomes align with the findings from forensic psychologists who also reported the eye movements as distinctive for the truthful and deceptive behavior. The research outcomes and proposed approach are beneficial for human experts and has many applications within interdisciplinary domains.

AB  - Typically, Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is one of the key features for graph stamping in graph theory. The general approach is to paint at least edges, vertices, or the surface of the graph with some colors. In the simplest case, a kind of coloring is preferable in which two vertices are not adjacent to the same color. Similarly, the two edges in the same joint should not have the same color. In addition, the same goes for the surface color of the graph. This is one of the NP-hard issues well studied in graph theory. Therefore, many different meta-heuristic techniques are presented to solve the problem and provide high performance. Seemingly, regardless of the importance of the nature-stimulated meta-heuristic methods to solve the GCP, there is not any inclusive report and detailed review about overviewing and investigating the crucial problems of the field. As a result, the present study introduces a wide-ranging reporting of nature- stimulated meta-heuristic methods, which are used throughout the graph coloring. The literature review contains a classification of significant techniques. This study mainly aims at emphasizing the optimization algorithms to handle the GCP problems. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the meta-heuristic algorithms in solving the GCP and their key issues are examined to offer more advanced meta-heuristic techniques in the future.

AB  - Digital Twins can be considered as a new phase in smart and data-driven greenhouse horticulture. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent to a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Research indicates that they can substantially enhance productivity and sustainability, and are able to deal with the increasing scarcity of green labour in greenhouse horticulture. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on Digital Twin applications in greenhouse horticulture. The review identifies 8 articles that explicitly address Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture and 115 studies that implicitly apply the Digital Twin concept in smart IoT-based systems. Findings indicate that the concept of the Digital Twin is in a seminal phase in greenhouse horticulture, but there are existing applications that are not yet framed as Digital Twins. In the reviewed papers, there is a dominant focus on the cultivation process at the greenhouse level, among others for climate control, energy management and lighting. About 9% of the articles are virtualizing plants themselves, which indicates that the granularity level addressed is still rather limited. Only 7 % of the articles look beyond plants or single greenhouses. None of the reviewed articles consider the company level. Furthermore, most applications address monitoring and control of the state and behaviour of real-life objects. More advanced applications, including predictive and prescriptive capabilities across the complete lifecycle, are still in an early stage of development, although predictive Digital Twins are gaining prominence.

KW  - Autonomic network management
KW  - Self-x network management
KW  - Meta learning
AB  - The evolution of mobile network technologies and their vertical integration, heterogeneity of applications, and the advent of sophisticated end-user devices have continuously been expanding the complexity of network management tasks. In addition, there is a significant urge for the dynamic reconfiguration of networks to meet operators’ costs and to achieve their performance objectives. These facts substantiate the idea of pushing the classical human dependent network management approaches out of the equation to a great extent. The vast scope of network management makes it difficult to have a common understanding and definition, which is often noticeable in different research articles. The situation is further worsened by the network evolution timeline that traverses several technological shifts, such as the time when computer networks and mobile networks were far apart, to the time of fully IP-based and converged networks. Hence, one of the main aims of this paper is to provide a study of the network management evolution in general and in particular the concepts of autonomic network management, so that researchers may be equipped to understand the involved concepts. To achieve the aforementioned objective, the authors carried out an elaborate analysis of the different network management approaches, mapped them to a timeline, and discussed their features. This analysis sets the stage for an extensive discussion of the enabling concepts of autonomic network management, followed by a survey of research projects targeting the advancement of the autonomic networking vision. Having identified incomplete realizations of autonomic network management due to simplifying assumptions, this paper focused on the relevant aspects of architectural construction with the presentation of the core challenges to be addressed so as to realize a fully autonomic network management framework. These challenges led us to reconstruct the design goals that the contributions of this work were built upon. The first proposal of this paper is to deploy intelligent software agents on different hierarchical layers of the proposed mobile network architecture. The agents implement different stages of cognitive control loops and contribute to learning algorithms for various management tasks. CoDIPAS-RL learning framework is used for layer specific learning decisions. To advance the autonomic network management, the authors also propose a novel idea of self-learning that enables the meta-learning vision. This paper concludes with a discussion on the implementation of our autonomic network management framework and with a use case that shows the performance of the proposed approach.

AB  - Purpose
One group of risk governance actors that recently came into focus for empirical studies is the board of directors. In this context, the increasing number of directors that work on more than one board committee (committee overlap) as well as its effects on monitoring effectiveness has become a prevalent subject of discussion. In this context, this paper aims to investigate the current status of empirical research on how committee overlap affects monitoring effectiveness.
Design/methodology/approach
A meta-analytical approach is used, encompassing a total sample of 167,449 observations. The authors consider several determinants of monitoring effectiveness such as reporting quality, executive compensation, pay for performance-sensitivity, CEO turnover, audit fees, qualified audit opinion and investment/overinvestment.
Findings
The authors’ meta-analysis proves that research on the effects of committee overlap yielded highly controversial results. Although there is no correlation between overlap and monitoring effectiveness at the general level, the presence of their relationship is still confirmed in a few subcategories. The authors also verify that the legal requirements regarding board structure and committee overlap has a certain influence, particularly in the common law system.
Originality/value
The meta-analytical insights help to derive statements that are more comprehensive and go beyond the results of the investigated primary studies. Furthermore, the insights offer implications for firms, theory and new opportunities regarding future empirical research to address unresolved questions.

AB  - Rate coefficients for the reactions of hydroxyl radicals and chlorine atoms with two biogenic volatile organic compounds as (E)-2-hexenyl acetate and 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one have been determined at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. The decay of the organics was followed using a chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and the rate constants were determined using a relative rate method. Rate coefficients are found to be (in cm3 molecule−1 s−1): k1(OH + (E)-2-hexenyl acetate) = (6.88 ± 1.41) × 10−11, k2(Cl + (E)-2-hexenyl acetate) = (3.10 ± 1.13) × 10−10, k3(OH + 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one) = (1.02 ± 0.20) × 10−10 and k4(Cl + 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one) = (2.66 ± 0.90) × 10−10 at 298 K. This is the first kinetic experimental study for these reactions studied under atmospheric pressure. The rate coefficients are compared with previous determinations for other unsaturated and oxygenated compounds and reactivity trends are presented. Products identification studies were performed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method employing on-fiber products derivatization with o-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride using gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer detector (GC-MS) for the reactions studied. In addition, atmospheric lifetimes of the unsaturated compounds studied are estimated and compared with other tropospheric sinks for these compounds.

AB  - Digital transformation and automation in the shipping industry is resulting disruptive changes to ship design, operations, and manning that aim to enhance safety, efficiency, and the environmental sustainability of maritime logistics. While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0. This paper suggests that the impact of this revolution in the maritime industry can be defined by concepts such as Maritime 5.0, Shipping 5.0, Seafarer 5.0, Maritime Education and Training 5.0 (MET 5.0).

AB  - This paper is concerned with the internationalization of firms that combine social and profit objectives at their core, referred to as social hybrid firms. In contrast to most profit-focused firms, such firms tend to place considerable attention on the social impact within their local communities. For this reason, the internationalization behavior of these firms has received limited research attention. In our empirical setting, however, some social hybrid firms go beyond their local communities and internationalize. Using the attention-based view as a theoretical framework, we hypothesize several boundary conditions that affect the internationalization of social hybrid firms and test them with a representative data set of small and medium-sized, privately-owned, indigenous businesses in Canada. Our findings reveal that social hybrid firms are more likely to internationalize when the levels of institutional isomorphism are high and when the organization leverages economic network ties. However, social network ties and government support reduce the likelihood of social hybrid firms to internationalize. The study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the phenomenon of social hybrid firms, their internationalization, and the attention-based view of the firm.

AB  - ﻿Abstract
The main role of flagship species in biodiversity conservation is to raise awareness and funds for conservation. Because of their marketing role, flagship species are often selected based on other than biodiversity related criteria, such as species charisma or aesthetic appeal. Nonetheless, funds raised through flagship species are often used to protect the species itself, making it important to evaluate the effectiveness of flagship species as conservation tools: For example, could superior fundraising ability outweigh the low biodiversity surrogate power of a flagship, justifying this ambivalent role in conservation? To assess flagship effectiveness from this dual perspective, we must synthesize evidence on a) the fundraising potential of flagship species vs. other conservation targets, such as ecosystems or biodiversity, and b) the biodiversity surrogate power of potential flagship taxa. We approached this broad topic through an overview of reviews on both subtopics. We found no evidence that charismatic flagship species were superior fundraisers over other conservation targets. In addition, studies evaluating the biodiversity surrogacy power of different taxa had mainly resulted in mixed findings, contesting the overall usefulness of the concept in conservation. The variability of study setups and methods made comparisons between studies difficult, highlighting the need to standardize future research (e.g., standardizing explanatory variables). Further possible reasons for lack of conclusive evidence on fundraising potential are the dominance of factors other than flagship identity (e.g., scope and conservation status) and differences in donor preferences. We recommend Environmental NGOs to develop and diversify their fundraising strategies based on best available knowledge, and rely less on mere species charisma.

AB  - New-age research in science including biological sciences will be driven as well as challenged by a flood of biological data that needs proper handling in order to be able to harness the advantage of data in research. In fact, research in biological sciences including genetics has become more data-intensive, with a higher throughput of studies, cases, and assays, in order to derive meaningful insights from studying small components of a larger system. Greater data give better insights into the biological phenomenon and need appropriate support from allied disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, physics, and bioinformatics. However, any such integration of these will be driven largely by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) providing complex algorithms for processing biological data. The disciplines of genetics, genomics, and other allied sciences have provided theoretical foundations of plant breeding for developing crop varieties. The unprecedented challenges of food security, climate change, sustainability, and safeguarding ecosystem services have necessitated appropriate technologies including climate-resilient varieties that add sustainability to intensive agriculture. Since the progress of plant breeding in recent times has largely been driven by genomics, molecular markers, as well as other multi-omics technologies, it is imperative to create institutional mechanisms for mainstreaming the effective use of AI and AI in genetics, genomics, and crop breeding platforms. Crop genetics and breeding as a science has progressed beyond imagination, from the Mendelian ratios to more of a predictive analysis that has touched every aspect of human existence such as the origin and evolution of life, evolutionary trends, plant and human health, as well as understanding the genomic basis of biological diversity and synteny relationships (structural, functional, and comparative genomics) to precise manipulation of genes (gene editing). The phenomenal growth and outstanding discoveries in genetics and crop breeding have witnessed huge data and information that need toolkits for interpretation using statistical techniques, AI/ML algorithms and data mining to examine historical data and to precisely forecast upcoming events. This chapter throws light on the basics of these aspects as applied to genetics and plant breeding.

Emphasis is given to studies of azoles by multinuclear dynamic NMR spectroscopy because prototropic transformations of almost all azoles in solution proceed so quickly. Quantum-chemical investigations of tautomeric azoles are covered in detail. Critical analysis of literature data on the tautomerism of azoles is presented. Theoretical studies of structure and reactivity of azoles are most intriguing because correct interpretation of their chemical behavior and biological activity depends on an understanding the factors determining relative stability of their tautomers. 15N NMR spectroscopy is the most reliable and fast technique for structural and tautomeric determination of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds.

El uso de productos del tabaco novedosos, en especial el cigarrillo electrónico y los dispositivos de combustión parcial de tabaco (sistemas Heat not Burn), han aumentado de forma exponencial, sobre todo en jóvenes y adolescentes. Las autoridades sanitarias y las sociedades científicas han mostrado preocupación ante las dudas que existen sobre su seguridad y eficacia (como método de abandono del tabaco). Tras el estudio de la evidencia científica disponible no es posible asegurar la inocuidad de los vapores o humos que inhalan los usuarios de estos dispositivos. Respecto a la eficacia no pueden recomendarse tras los resultados contradictorios de diferentes ensayos clínicos y metaanálisis, máxime cuando existen tratamientos seguros y eficaces para ayudar a dejar de fumar (vareniclina, terapia sustitutiva con nicotina y bupropion, unido al asesoramiento psicológico).
The use of novel tobacco products, particularly the electronic cigarette (EC) and partial tobacco combustion devices (HnB systems: Heat not Burn), has increased exponentially, particularly among adolescents and young people. The health authorities and scientific societies have shown concern about issues surrounding safety and effectiveness (as a method of smoking cessation). A study of the available scientific evidence has concluded that the safety of the vapor or fumes inhaled by the users of these devices cannot be guaranteed. Contradictory results from various clinical trials and meta-analyses also mean that these devices cannot be recommended for their effectiveness in cessation, especially when safe and effective treatments are available to help quit smoking (varenicline, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion, combined with psychological counseling).

AB  - We address the curse of dimensionality in dynamic covariance estimation by modeling the underlying co-volatility dynamics of a time series vector through latent time-varying stochastic factors. The use of a global–local shrinkage prior for the elements of the factor loadings matrix pulls loadings on superfluous factors towards zero. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed framework, the model is applied to simulated data as well as to daily log-returns of 300 S&P 500 members. Our approach yields precise correlation estimates, strong implied minimum variance portfolio performance and superior forecasting accuracy in terms of log predictive scores when compared to typical benchmarks.

AB  - Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, with multiple underlying inflammatory pathways and structural airway abnormalities that impact disease persistence and severity. Recent progress has been made in developing targeted asthma therapeutics, especially for subjects with eosinophilic asthma. However, there is an unmet need for new approaches to treat patients with severe and exacerbation-prone asthma, who contribute disproportionately to disease burden. Extensive deep phenotyping has revealed the heterogeneous nature of severe asthma and identified distinct disease subtypes. A current challenge in the field is to translate new and emerging knowledge about different pathobiologic mechanisms in asthma into patient-specific therapies, with the ultimate goal of modifying the natural history of disease. Here, we describe the Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network, a groundbreaking collaborative effort of asthma researchers and biostatisticians from around the United States. The PrecISE Network was designed to conduct phase II/proof-of-concept clinical trials of precision interventions in the population with severe asthma, and is supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Using an innovative adaptive platform trial design, the PrecISE Network will evaluate up to 6 interventions simultaneously in biomarker-defined subgroups of subjects. We review the development and organizational structure of the PrecISE Network, and choice of interventions being studied. We hope that the PrecISE Network will enhance our understanding of asthma subtypes and accelerate the development of therapeutics for severe asthma.

AB  - Fitness applications have undergone considerable development in the last few years and becoming popular and significant in both academic and practical areas. However, contributions to the systematic mapping of this field continue to be lacking. This paper constitutes the first bibliometric study in this field to better understand the current state of research. We examined 481 records from databases Scopus and Web of Science (Core Collection) using several bibliometric analysis methods. All the records on this emerging topic were published between 2011 and 2019. We processed these records using statistical analysis and science mapping. The bibliometric analysis included the year of publication, journal name, citation, author, country, and particularly, research methodology. Additionally, we used the VOSViewer software to perform bibliometric mapping of co-authorship, co-citation of authors, and co-occurrence of keywords. This field of study, it was found, is currently in its precursor stage, contributing primarily to the fields of medicine, computer science, and health sciences. The United States appeared to have made the largest contribution to this field. However, author productivity, number of citations, and number of core journals all indicated a high degree of fragmentation of research in this filed. Remarkably, scientific research in this area is expected to progress tremendously over time. Overall, this study provides basic data and research classifications for the initial phase of research and research direction for future research in this area.

AB  - Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have considerable potential to achieve sustainability in logistics and supply chain management. However, the integration of blockchain-IoT has not been explored extensively in past research. This research provides a complete analysis of the enablers for using blockchain-IoT to manage logistics and supply chains. It aims to explore and prioritise various enablers for its adoption. The Diffusion of Innovation and the Technology-Organisation-Environment theories are used in this research to examine blockchain-IoT adoption enablers. The enablers identification is confirmed using the Fuzzy-Delphi technique and then analysed using the fuzzy - Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory tool to determine the strength of cause-effect hierarchical framework. The sensitivity analysis is also carried out to address the robustness of the results obtained. In order to measure the extent of a firm's readiness to adopt blockchain-IoT, a framework based on Graph Theory Matrix Method is proposed. It is illustrated with the help of a real life case. The results revealed that ‘sustainability focus’, ‘emphasis on emerging technology by organisation’, and ‘technology maturity’ are the top three enablers for blockchain-IoT adoption. Findings of study may motivate managers to include blockchain-IoT into their strategic planning processes based on their categorization of enablers into cause and effect categories. The research findings may also be used to the creation of efficient Blockchain-IoT deployment methods.

AB  - We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of stimulant and non-stimulant medications on autonomic functioning in people with ADHD (PROSPERO: CRD42020212439). We searched (9th August 2021) PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, for randomised and non-randomised studies reporting indices of autonomic activity, (electrodermal, pupillometry and cardiac), pre- and post-medication exposure in people meeting DSM/ICD criteria for ADHD. In the narrative syntheses, we included 5 electrodermal studies, 1 pupillometry study and 57 studies investigating heart rate and blood pressure. In the meta-analyses, 29 studies were included on blood pressure and 32 on heart rate. Administration of stimulants, and to a lesser degree, non-stimulants increased heart rate and blood pressure in people with ADHD. Similarly, an upregulation of arousal, reflected in increased electrodermal activity and pupil diameter was observed following stimulant use. Yet, the methodological diversity of studies presented in this review reinforces the need for more standardised and rigorous research to fully understand the relationship between arousal, medication, and behaviour in ADHD.

AB  - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is acknowledged to be suited for the assessment of the energy-environmental burdens of foods, which are estimated to be overall one of the main impact sources worldwide. A right nutrition is even more fundamental for the healthy growing of the population, which has now, however, to consider ever more the aspect connected to its environmental impact. Under this perspective, this study aims at exploring the environmental burdens associated with a local university canteen for students through the application of LCA to a set of meal combination scenarios offered weekly to consumers. For the assessment, the authors designed a set of eight meal alternatives to create four daily meal combinations (DMCs), assuming 150 customers frequent the canteen service daily. Sixteen DMC scenarios based on a 1-to−3 weekly offer frequency have been tested. Results show the environmental impacts are highly affected by the food content and the weekly offer frequency, with the largest contributions coming when higher frequencies are combined with more impactful foods in the menus. The study highlights, overall, that global warming, eutrophication, acidification, and the depletion of the abiotic elements are the most relevant indicators for such an evaluation. The study aims at building a more sustainable and resilient future for the planet, starting with producing and consuming foods that are ecologically responsible, fair and accessible, local, healthy and safe, and waste free.

AB  - Introduction
Despite the clinical, epidemiological, and economic significance of metabolic syndrome, the profile of clinical trials on this disease is unknown.
Objective
To characterize the clinical trials related to treatment of metabolic syndrome during the 1980–2015 period.
Methods
Systematic review of the literature using an ex ante search protocol which followed the phases of the guide Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses in four multidisciplinary databases with seven search strategies. Reproducibility and methodological quality of the studies were assessed.
Results
One hundred and six trials were included, most from the United States, Italy, and Spain, of which 63.2% evaluated interventions effective for several components of the syndrome such as diet (40.6%) or physical activity (22.6%). Other studies assessed drugs for a single factor such as hypertension (7.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (11.3%), or hyperglycemia (9.4%). Placebo was used as control in 54.7% of trials, and outcome measures included triglycerides (52.8%), HDL (48.1%), glucose (29.2%), BMI (33.0%), blood pressure (27.4%), waist circumference (26.4%), glycated hemoglobin (11.3%), and hip circumference (7.5%).
Conclusion
It was shown that studies ob efficacy of treatment for metabolic syndrome are scarce and have mainly been conducted in the last five years and in high-income countries. Trials on interventions that affect three or more factors and assess several outcome measures are few, and lifestyle interventions (diet and physical activity) are highlighted as most important to impact on this multifactorial syndrome.
Resumen
Introducción
A pesar de la importancia clínica, epidemiológica y económica del síndrome metabólico, a la fecha se desconoce el perfil de los ensayos clínicos disponibles para esta enfermedad.
Objetivo
Caracterizar los ensayos clínicos relacionados con el tratamiento del síndrome metabólico durante el periodo 1980-2015.
Métodos
Revisión sistemática de la literatura con un protocolo de búsqueda ex ante que cumplió las fases de la guía Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses en cuatro bases de datos multidisciplinarias con siete estrategias de búsqueda. Se evaluó reproducibilidad y calidad metodológica de los estudios.
Resultados
Se incluyeron 106 ensayos, la mayoría de Estados Unidos, Italia y España. El 63,2% evaluó intervenciones con eficacia para varios componentes del síndrome como dieta (40,6%) o actividad física (22,6%), las demás evaluaron medicamentos para uno de los factores como hipertensión (7,5%), hipertrigliceridemia (11,3%) o hiperglucemia (9,4%). En los controles el 54,7% usó placebo, y entre las variables de resultado el 52,8% incluyó triglicéridos, 48,1% cHDL, 29,2% glucemia, 33,0% IMC, 27,4% presión arterial, 26,4% perímetro de cintura, 11,3% hemoglobina glucosilada y 7,5% perímetro de cadera.
Conclusión
Se evidenció que los estudios sobre eficacia terapéutica para el síndrome metabólico son escasos y se concentran en el último quinquenio y en países de altos ingresos. Los ensayos sobre intervenciones que impactan tres o más factores y evalúan varias variables de resultado son reducidos, destacándose las intervenciones del estilo de vida (dieta y actividad física) como las de mayor importancia para impactar la multifactorialidad del síndrome.

AB  - The evaluation of the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants is a crucial issue to assess the anthropogenic burden on the environment. Numerous chemometric approaches are available for data exploration and they have been applied for environmental health assessment purposes. Among the unsupervised methods, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an artificial neural network able to handle non-linear problems that can be used for exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, and variable relationship assessment. Much more interpretation ability is gained when the SOM-based model is merged with clustering algorithms. This review comprises: (i) a description of the algorithm operation principle with a focus on the key parameters used for the SOM initialization; (ii) a description of the SOM output features and how they can be used for data mining; (iii) a list of available software tools for performing calculations; (iv) an overview of the SOM application for obtaining spatial and temporal pollution patterns in the environmental compartments with focus on model training and result visualization; (v) advice on reporting SOM model details in a paper to attain comparability and reproducibility among published papers as well as advice for extracting valuable information from the model results is presented.

AB  - In this review, a summary is presented of the main reports regarding the potential ocular manifestations of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Scientific evidence is based on letters to the editor, clinical cases and case series, cross-sectional, and a few longitudinal studies. To date, it includes viral conjunctivitis, immune conjunctivitis, and oculomotor palsies (OCP) due to the novel coronavirus. Retinopathy is discussed, but no cases have been published yet. A viral conjunctivitis outbreak can be isolated or associated with the systemic picture, mainly pulmonary, before or after the onset of respiratory symptoms. It can be both unilateral and bilateral, follicles are typical, and duration is variable between 5 and 21 days. Immune-mediated conjunctivitis consists of eye redness, together with erythroderma and fever. It appears more frequently in children, and has been associated with a “Kawasaki-like” disease and toxic shock syndrome. OCP can present on its own, or as part of Miller-Fisher syndrome, along with ataxia, and hyporeflexia. Ophthalmologists have a considerable risk of developing COVID-19 due to close contact with the patient, exposure to tears and eye secretions, and the use of various pieces of equipment and devices susceptible to contamination.
Resumen
En esta revisión resumimos las principales publicaciones que informan sobre las potenciales manifestaciones oculares de la enfermedad por el nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19). La evidencia científica se basa en cartas al editor, casos clínicos aislados y series de casos, principalmente de corte transversal. Hasta la fecha, incluimos la conjuntivitis viral, una conjuntivitis inmunomediada y parálisis oculomotoras (POM). Se discute la posibilidad de retinopatía. La conjuntivitis viral puede aparecer aislada o asociada al cuadro sistémico, principalmente pulmonar, antes o después del inicio de los síntomas respiratorios. Puede ser tanto unilateral como bilateral, es típica la presencia de folículos, y presenta una duración variable entre 5 y 20 días. La conjuntivitis inmunomediada consiste en un enrojecimiento ocular acompañada de eritrodermia y febrícula. Aparece más frecuentemente en los niños y se ha asociado a un cuadro «Kawasaki-like» y síndrome del shock tóxico. Las POM pueden presentarse de forma aislada, o formando parte de un síndrome de Miller-Fisher, junto con ataxia e hiporreflexia. Los oftalmólogos presentamos un riesgo considerable de contraer la COVID-19 debido a un contacto estrecho con el paciente, exposición a las lágrimas y a las secreciones oculares y al uso de multitud de equipos y aparatos susceptibles de contaminarse.

AB  - Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss Luciano Floridi’s 2019 book The Logic of Information: A Theory of Philosophy as Conceptual Design, the latest instalment in his philosophy of information (PI) tetralogy, particularly with respect to its implications for library and information studies (LIS).
Design/methodology/approach
Nine scholars with research interests in philosophy and LIS read and responded to the book, raising critical and heuristic questions in the spirit of scholarly dialogue. Floridi responded to these questions.
Findings
Floridi’s PI, including this latest publication, is of interest to LIS scholars, and much insight can be gained by exploring this connection. It seems also that LIS has the potential to contribute to PI’s further development in some respects.
Research limitations/implications
Floridi’s PI work is technical philosophy for which many LIS scholars do not have the training or patience to engage with, yet doing so is rewarding. This suggests a role for translational work between philosophy and LIS.
Originality/value
The book symposium format, not yet seen in LIS, provides forum for sustained, multifaceted and generative dialogue around ideas.

KW  - Overlapping coalition formation
AB  - A coalition as a group of agents aims to work jointly to earn much more gains as a result of their cooperation. Many existing studies assumed that members take advantage of joining one coalition at a time, albeit the importance of coalition formation problems. Therefore, more attention to overlapping coalitions needs to be paid to optimise resource management by forming in multiple overlapping coalitions simultaneously. Roughly speaking, the related literature includes two main streams; (i) theoretical foundations of coalition formation games and, (ii) the coalition structure generation problems. This paper first provides a review of coalition structure generation at large to develop a taxonomic framework and classify the existing literature, viz., macro analysis. The paper then reviews studies on overlapping coalitions thoroughly, viz., micro analysis. The micro analysis presents and discusses different models of overlapping coalition games and related solution concepts as well as surveying all problem-solving approaches for overlapping coalition structure generation. Finally, the outstanding challenges and opportunities for future research considerations are discussed and shared.

KW  - Systematic literature review
AB  - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.

AB  - Technological advancements such as information and communication technologies (ICTs), artificial intelligence (AI), internet-of-things (IoT), and the increasing popularity of the smart city and smart living movements during the last couple of decades boosted the developments in the smart home domain. Although the number of smart home related research has been expanding rapidly, there is still a lack of systematic analysis of the evolution of this research domain. This study helps to generate an understanding of the historical vicissitude, state-of-the-art and emerging trends, and the existing smart home research clusters. The study applies a scientometric method to analyse the published scholarly research (n = 17,153) over the last two decades, from 2000 to 2021. The scientometric analysis findings reveal that: Smart home literature has experienced steady growth during the last two decades; Smart home research has mainly clustered around ICT for home automation, home information management, AI for home automation, domestic energy management, IoT for home automation, and home-based healthcare areas; IoT is seen as the most popular technology to realise fully functioning smart homes; Limited evidence exists on the urban perspective and social issues of smart home technology; Smart homes are seen potentially as a strong driver of the smart city agenda.

The systematic review was carried out in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases and 12 descriptive studies were reviewed. The European and American quantitative studies reported moderate and high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and burnout, with diverse coping strategies and more frequent and intense symptoms among women and nurses, without conclusive results by age. In the first line of assistance the psychological impact was greater than in the rest of the health professionals and in the Asian area. It is necessary to go deeper into the emotional experiences and professional needs for emotional support in order to design effective interventions for protection and help.
Resumen

La revisión se realizó en las bases PubMed, Scopus y Web of Science y se seleccionaron 12 artículos. Los estudios cuantitativos realizados en Europa y EE. UU. refirieron niveles moderados y altos de estrés, ansiedad, depresión, alteración del sueño y burnout, con estrategias de afrontamiento diversas y síntomas más frecuentes e intensos entre mujeres y enfermería, sin resultados concluyentes por edad. En la primera línea de asistencia, el impacto fue mayor que en el resto de profesionales sanitarios y que en el ámbito asiático. Se requiere profundizar en las experiencias emocionales y necesidades profesionales de apoyo emocional, para diseñar intervenciones eficaces de protección y ayuda.

AB  - This paper studies how biases in managerial beliefs affect managerial decisions, firm performance, and the macroeconomy. Using a new survey of US managers I establish three facts. (1) Managers are not overoptimistic: sales growth forecasts on average do not exceed realizations. (2) Managers are overprecise: they underestimate future sales growth volatility. (3) Managers overextrapolate: their forecasts are too optimistic after positive shocks and too pessimistic after negative shocks. To quantify the implications, I estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model in which managers of heterogeneous firms use a subjective beliefs process to make forward-looking hiring decisions. Overprecision and overextrapolation lead managers to overreact to firm-level shocks and overspend on adjustment costs, destroying 2.1% to 6.8% of the typical firm’s value. Pervasive overreaction leads to excess volatility and reallocation, lowering consumer welfare by 0.5% to 2.3% relative to the rational-expectations equilibrium. These findings suggest overreaction could amplify asset-price and business-cycle fluctuations.

AB  - Summary
Background
There is a lack of up-to-date estimates about the prevalence of Chagas disease (ChD) clinical presentations and, therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence of clinical forms of ChD among seropositive adults, pooling available data.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted in Medline, Embase, Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde and Cochrane databases looking for studies published from 1990 to August 2023, which investigated the prevalence of ChD clinical forms among seropositive adults, including: (i) indeterminate phase, (ii) chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM), (iii) digestive and (iv) mixed (CCM + digestive) forms. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Studies quality and risk of bias was assessed with the Leboeuf-Yde and Lauritsen tool. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022354237).
Findings
1246 articles were selected for screening and 73 studies were included in the final analysis (17,132 patients, 44% men). Most studies were conducted with outpatients (n = 50), followed by population-based studies (n = 15). The pooled prevalence of the ChD clinical forms was: indeterminate 42.6% (95% CI: 36.9–48.6), CCM 42.7% (95% CI: 37.3–48.3), digestive 17.7% (95% CI: 14.9–20.9), and mixed 10.2% (95% CI: 7.9–13.2). In population-based studies, prevalence was lower for CCM (31.2%, 95% CI: 24.4–38.9) and higher for indeterminate (47.2%, 95% CI: 39.0–55.5) form. In meta-regression, age was inversely associated with the prevalence of indeterminate (β = −0.05, P < 0.001) form, and directly associated with CCM (β = 0.06, P < 0.001) and digestive (β = 0.02, P < 0.001) forms. Heterogeneity was overall high.
Interpretation
Compared to previous publications, our pooled estimates show a higher prevalence of CCM among ChD seropositive patients, but similar rates of the digestive form.
Funding
This study was funded by the World Heart Federation, through a research collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG.

AB  - Recently, there are growing interests in cognitive radio vehicular ad hoc networks (CR-VANETs), which is a kind of intelligent cyber-physical systems. In CR-VANETs, there are two main processes: spectrum sensing and data transmission. Although some excellent works have been done to address spectrum sensing security and data transmission security in CR-MANETs, these two important areas have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper, we propose to use a common framework to study trust management so as to enhance security for both spectrum sensing and data transmission processes in CR-VANETs. We identify a new attack, named joint spectrum sensing and data transmission (JSSDT) attack, in which an attacker can report fake sensing data in the spectrum sensing process as well as drop packets in the data transmission process. Then, using recent advances in the theory of uncertain reasoning, we propose a unified trust management scheme for both spectrum sensing and data transmission processes in CR-VANETs. In addition, based on the unified trust model, we present a weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing scheme to protect the spectrum sensing process. Moreover, we apply the trust value derived from the unified trust model to enhance the security of the data transmission process in CR-VANETs. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed trust-based security schemes.

KW  - Hydrogen storage
AB  - Following the seminal B–N–H compound ammonia borane NH3BH3, a series of derivatives have been developed as possible chemical hydrogen carriers. First, alkali and alkaline earth derivatives of ammonia borane, i.e. amidoboranes M(NH2BH3)n with n = 1 or 2, emerged. Then, hydrazine borane, which is actually a derivative of ammonia borane, was re-discovered and considered as a precursor of alkali and alkaline earth derivatives, i.e. hydrazinidoboranes M(N2H3BH3)n. A number of B–N–H ionic salts were, in this way, synthesized and reported. The present review provides the general background (e.g. syntheses, crystallographic structures, thermal stability, dehydrogenation properties, and decomposition mechanisms) relating to these alkali and alkaline earth amidoboranes and hydrazinidoboranes, and carries on two objectives. The first objective is to discuss the potential of these materials (for the application for which they have been primarily developed over the past decades, namely hydrogen storage) and the challenges they are facing. It is concluded that the light alkali amidoboranes, namely the lithium, sodium and potassium amidoboranes) should be further developed owing to better dehydrogenation properties in terms of the onset temperature of dehydrogenation, the extent of dehydrogenation, and the purity of the hydrogen released. They should, however, be further developed with the aim of upscaling, something that has not yet been achieved. Achieving high technological readiness levels is thereby the main challenge ahead. The second objective of the present review is to explore alternative uses because, as things stand, none of the developed materials have the expected features for hydrogen storage. We suggest that any of the discussed derivatives are potentially solid-state reducing agents, energetic materials, and/or precursors of boron nitride-based ceramics, bearing in mind that for this last use, if the targeted material is porous, it could be regarded as a reversible hydrogen sorbent. It is thus important to maintain efforts in the development of the current derivatives as well as in the discovery of novel ones.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, AI & Law has provided breakthroughs in studies involving case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, information retrieval and, most recently, conceptual models for knowledge representation and reasoning, known as Legal Ontologies. Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law.

AB  - Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TFSC) is a leading peer-reviewed journal that addresses issues at the intersection of technology and society. A major strategy of the journal is to actively solicit and publish Special Issues (SIs). These SIs were first launched in 1979 to highlight and solicit manuscripts from the “hot” emerging issues of the discipline. This paper aims to analyze SIs and to highlight it's impact on TFSC as compared to Regular Issues (RIs). Using bibliometric analysis, this study first establishes that SIs have a higher impact on the field than RIs when evaluated based on average citations per manuscript, percentage of ‘hot’ papers, and the rate of citations per annum. The study then identifies leading actors (authors, affiliated institutions, and countries) and journals (knowledge inflow/outflow) that have contributed to the success of TFSC-SIs. Finally, using bibliographic coupling, seven thematic clusters of TFSC's SIs were identified. These clusters were compared with the knowledge clusters developed by Singh et al. (2020) for the entirety of TFSC journals, and four clusters unique to SIs were identified i.e. (Climate Change & Energy, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Sustainability and, Social Media & Internet of Things). It is observed that these unique SI clusters have received disproportionate attention during the last decade and are likely to influence the future trajectory of the journal.

AB  - The ability and limitations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for correlating and predicting properties of fluids are discussed. Common mistakes found in applications of ANN to fluid property estimation presented in the literature are analyzed and a useful and appropriate way of presenting results of these applications is proposed. As a study case the use of ANN for correlating and predicting the solubility of difluoromethane (R-32, C2H2F2), in seventeen ionic liquids is performed and discussed. The dependent variable is the solubility of R-32 and the independent variables are the temperature (T) and pressure (P), in addition to properties that identify each Ionic Liquid, such as critical temperature (Tc), the critical pressure (Pc), the mass connectivity index (λ), the acentric factor (ω), the mass of the cation (M+) and the mass of the anion (M−). Six cases, combining these independent variables in different forms were analyzed. The study shows that although some cases of the proposed artificial neural networks model give good results for training and testing, none of them gives acceptable results for prediction. Finally, some indications and suggestions are given to correctly apply ANN and to present the results in the literature.

AB  - Most traits of interest for aquaculture, such as disease resistance or feed efficiency, are heritable but controlled by many loci of small effect. While current selective breeding programs enable the efficient genetic improvement of these traits, discovering QTLs and their underlying causative variants may increase the rates of genetic gain of aquaculture breeding programs. The discovery of causative variants can also significantly contribute to our fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of complex traits and lead to potential targets for genome editing. In this chapter, we present an overview of concepts and methods underpinning QTL mapping, detail a step-by-step example pipeline to perform genome-wide association analyses, and discuss the current state and future prospects in this line of research.

AB  - Given the detrimental consequences of climate change on the environment, hydrogen appears to be one of the solutions to possible decarbonization. Although it is a potential option, the subject of hydrogen production utilizing nuclear spent fuel (SNF) through water radiolysis has not received much attention to explore its potential use for large-scale hydrogen production. This review, therefore, presents an overview of research work on the use of SNF’s ionizing radiation for the production of hydrogen and its potential impact on environmental safety. This paper investigates the advantages and difficulties of hydrogen generation in SNF storage system by utilizing a bibliometric and systematic review technique to analyse previous research works. The research themes were classified into motor, niche, emerging/declining, and basic themes. Some important themes that were found to be central to the topic included radiation shielding, hydrogen production, and environmental sustainability; life cycle assessment; renewable energy integration; nuclear waste management; hydrogen storage; and modular reactors. The study identified some potential research gaps and provided some recommendations for future research. This includes the improvement in the hydrogen detection systems, hydrogen collection and ventilation, containment of radioactive isotopes, understanding radiolysis impacts, and the development of purification and storage methods for hydrogen from spent nuclear fuel. The outcome of this study is expected to shape future research on the subject matter and serve as the foundation for deeper understanding of radiolysis for commercial-scale hydrogen production.

AB  - Aquaculture is a recurring topic of controversy among public groups, often visible through news media representation. The media is an important source of information and communication that influences and reflects social consensus. Social license to operate is an ongoing concern within aquaculture that impacts development, limiting sustainable and ecological innovation. Aquaculture in Sweden is small, however, a growing interest in cultivating finfish and low trophic species is present. This study conducted a content analysis of media representation of different aquaculture species within Sweden, over a ten-year period, exploring the tones and main topics included within this context. Overall, aquaculture representation is increasing moderately because of articles pertaining to salmon and algae cultivation. Salmon aquaculture was perceived negatively overall, however, a positive discourse is emerging. There was a significant disparity between positive and negative tones among different species, where algae, mussels and low trophic sectors were favored positively. Environmental attributes were the most frequent for every species group and technological aspects are increasing significantly over time. The main topics of discussion included: sustainable potential and benefits of low trophic aquaculture, environmental degradation, and industry development. This research supports the development of local and restorative forms of aquaculture within Sweden, by contributing toward the understanding of the present public perspective.

AB  - Resilience engineering relates to the ability of a system to anticipate, prepare, and respond to predicted and unpredicted disruptions. It necessitates the use of monitoring and object detection technologies to ensure system safety in excavation systems. Given the increased investment and speed of improvement in technologies, it is necessary to review the types of technology available and how they contribute to excavation system safety. A systematic literature review was conducted which identified and classified the existing monitoring and object detection technologies, and introduced essential enablers for reliable and effective monitoring and object detection systems including: 1) the application of multisensory and data fusion approaches, and 2) system-level application of technologies. This study also identified the developed functionalities for accident anticipation, prevention and response to safety hazards during excavation, as well as those that facilitate learning in the system. The existing research gaps and future direction of research have been discussed.

AB  - The diffusion of salary information has implications for labor markets, such as wage discrimination policies and collective bargaining. Access to salary information is believed to be limited and unequal, but there is little direct evidence on the sources of these information frictions. Social scientists have long conjectured that privacy norms around salary (i.e., the “salary taboo”) play an important role. We provide unique evidence of this phenomenon based on a field experiment with 755 employees at a large commercial bank in Southeast Asia. We show that many of its employees are both unwilling to reveal their salaries to coworkers and reluctant to ask coworkers about their salaries. These frictions persist, in smaller magnitude, when sharing less sensitive information on seniority. We discuss implications for pay transparency policies and the gender wage gap.

Game Software Engineering (GSE) is a branch of Software Engineering (SE) that focuses on the development of video game applications. In past years, GSE has achieved enough volume, differences from traditional software engineering, and interest by the community to be considered an independent scientific domain, veering out from traditional SE.
Objective:
This study evaluates the current state of the art in software engineering for industry-scale computer games identifying gaps and consolidating the magnitude and growth of this field.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review is performed following best practices to ensure the relevance of the studies included in the review. We analyzed 98 GSE studies to extract the current intensity, topics, methods, and quality of GSE.
Results:
The GSE research community has been growing over the years, producing over four times more research than before the previous GSE survey. However, this community is still very dispersed, with no main venues holding most of the GSE scientific studies. A broader range of topics is covered in this area, evolving towards those of a mature field such as architecture and design. Also, the reviewed studies employ more elaborated empirical research methods, even though the study reports need to be more rigorous in sections related to the critical examination of the work.
Conclusion:
The results of the SLR lead to the identification of 13 potential future research directions for this domain. GSE is an independent, mature, and growing field that presents new ways of software creation where the gap between industry and academia is narrowing. Video games present themselves as powerful tools to push the boundaries of software knowledge.

AB  - Energy efficiency is an important concern that the scientific community and society will have to deal with in the coming years. Power-efficient structures and effective energy resource management in critical locations, such as tourist spots, have become a crucial problem that must be considered by environmental scientists and governments worldwide. The primary objective is to decrease the ecological effect of energy usage. Also, smart city activities are currently being aided by many innovative technologies such as the Internet of things and cloud computing. Because of the lack of comprehensive study in this field, this study aims to present a systematic and bibliographic overview of the literature on improving the energy efficiency of smart city equipment. This page presents the geographical locations where most publications in this discipline have been released. It provides a wide-ranging, accurate, and novel review of literature on optimizing the energy performance of smart city components. Utilizing computational optimization algorithms in this domain also opens up new perspectives in terms of energy efficiency. The results showed that these algorithms have successfully optimized energy consumption and reduced pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases.

AB  - The term “overtourism” refers to the negative impact of tourism on the quality of life of citizens and visitor experiences in a destination. It is a relatively new concept in scientific research. Any discussion of overtourism is meaningless without also considering sustainability. When costs exceed benefits, tourism development is no longer sustainable, and interventions become necessary. This review provides a rigorous and up-to-date synthesis of overtourism and its relationship with sustainability. The aim is to provide a clear and comprehensive picture of the increasingly strong link between the two. This article presents bibliometric analysis of documents published from 2018 onwards. It objectively and quantifiably assesses the state of the literature on overtourism in the context of sustainability. The evidence confirms that new research trends in overtourism are closely linked to European urban areas. The paper also reveals the agents directly or indirectly involved in the analysis and research process through an active funding strategy for this field of study. The main contribution of this study lies in showing public-private collaboration in the design and promotion of socio-technical and environmental transitions in tourism.

AB  - Increase in global population growth and the consequent rise in the demand for food while ensuring quality, preventing wastage, avoiding deforestation, and carbon footprinting has put tremendous pressure on the global food supply chain (FSC). Due to fast computing facilities and availability of data, blockchain technology has emerged as a potential system that may help in developing a safe and secure FSC. Blockchain has gained significant attention among researchers worldwide, which is evident from the extensive literature generated on this subject within a span of a few years. Through this paper, the authors attempt to showcase the immense scope and significance of blockchain in FSCs by examining and analyzing the existing studies. In addition to providing an overview of the application of blockchain in FSCs, this study also discusses challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and high cost and suggests potential solutions for the existing difficulties in adopting blockchain in FSCs. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis is provided to acquaint researchers and practitioners with the structure and research trends in this area. The study found that researchers have mostly focused on the applicability of blockchain for product authentication, finance, and logistics. Further, blockchain is likely to become a dominant technology for enhancing transparency and traceability, reducing risk and, most importantly, enhancing trust among different stakeholders in the area of FSC.

AB  - Background
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is among the most common reasons for disability in young adults. Mobility impairment, primarily related to gait and balance, is ranked as the preeminent concern among persons with MS (PwMS). Gait and balance dysfunction can directly affect the quality of life and activities of daily life in PwMS, hence the importance of effective treatment strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive effect of various non-pharmacological rehabilitation methods, including physiotherapy and electrical stimulation, on gait and mobility in PwMS. Non-pharmacological methods can be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each patient, allowing healthcare providers to create personalized training programs. Furthermore, these methods typically result in minimal or no side effects.
Purpose
This review provides a comprehensive overview of an array of non-pharmacological treatment approaches aimed at enhancing ambulatory performance in PwMS.
Methods
We performed a narrative review of the original papers available in PubMed, investigating the effects of different nonmedical approaches on the gait and balance performance of the PwMS. Reviewed treatment approaches include “exercise, physical rehabilitation, dual-task (DT) rehabilitation, robot-assisted rehabilitation, virtual reality-assisted rehabilitation, game training, electrical stimulation devices, auditory stimulation, visual feedback, and shoe insoles”.
Results and conclusions
Eighty articles were meticulously reviewed. Our study highlights the positive effects of non-pharmacological interventions on patients' quality of life, reducing disability, fatigue, and muscle spasticity. While some methods, including exercise and physiotherapy, showed substantial promise, further research is needed to evaluate whether visual biofeedback and auditory stimulation are preferable over conventional approaches. Additionally, approaches such as functional electrical stimulation, non-invasive brain stimulation, and shoe insoles demonstrate substantial short-term benefits, prompting further investigation into their long-term effects. Non-pharmacological interventions can serve as a valuable complement to medication-based approaches.

AB  - The kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanistic studies of sulfur homo- and copolymerization with cyclic and vinyl monomers are described as the major subjects of our review article. Besides, the syntheses, homo- and copolymerization of cyclic mono- and polysulfides are added. The analytical text is complemented with review of the related theoretical topics (mostly DFT), and include theoretical studies of the experimental data of the corresponding sections. Recently, mostly because of the elaboration of the novel process of sulfur copolymerization, so called “inverse vulcanization”, there is renewed interest in polymers of sulfur, with expectation of finding industrial applications, mostly as the Li-sulfur batteries, in optics, removal of toxic metals and biomaterials. We are also discussing papers on the equilibrium between polysulfur and sulfur, in homo- and copolymerization of sulfur with cyclic sulfides and with vinyl monomers. Copolymerization of sulfur is described for cyclic sulfides and vinyl monomers. Analysis of interaction with vinyl monomers involves both low temperatures - then sulfur is merely acting as the chain transfer agent, and for temperatures around the floor temperature, when more or less stable copolymers are formed with high sulfur content. It is also shown that with cyclic monomers the high molar mass copolymers of sulfur were prepared (up to 80 % of sulfur). Analysis of papers describing the molecular structures of copolymers of sulfur are complementing the analysis of the kinetics, thermodynamics and DFT of the studied processes, including the living/controlled polymerization of sulfur with cyclic sulfides. In the final section we analyse the published DFT and other theoretical analyses of the subjects discussed in the major text. These methods have been successfully applied to make predictions of the bond dissociation energies, enthalpies of formation, reaction energies and energy barriers, etc., contributing to a deeper understanding of the chemical processes, as it is shown in this review.

AB  - Climate adaptation is not a neutral or apolitical process, but one that ignites social resistance. Government responses to risks of floods, droughts, or hurricanes – even those using a language of participation – might follow historical development pathways, strive to maintain the status quo, and directly or indirectly serve elite interests. Little attention has been paid to how people defy or resist top-down adaptation processes, overtly or covertly, in particular cultural, historical, and legal contexts. Drawing on sociological thought on popular resistance, this paper systematises research on people’s resistance to climate adaptation by scrutinising the sites, repertoires, and consequences of such resistance. We identified overt and covert resistance in 56 scientific adaptation articles, which concentrated on 5 ‘sites’ of resistance: Rural livelihoods, Urban informal settlements, Islands, First Nations, and Institutional landscapes. The findings imply that resistance to adaptation occurs globally, and not least in the context of relocation processes and participatory adaptation. We show how a resistance lens can help understand contemporary political behaviours, shed light on dynamic and compound vulnerability, and’unlock’ more context-sensitive and even transformative adaptation. Meanwhile, resistance and popular movements are not only progressive, and there might be conceptual barriers to moving from resistance to transformation or reconciling resistance with actions by or with the state.

AB  - Smart cities have emerged as a result of smart interconnections of people, processes, data, and things, representing an excellent case study of the Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm. One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.

AB  - Objectives
In this review paper, we explored the application of “omics” approaches in the study of oral cancer (OC). It will provide a better understanding of how “omics” approaches may lead to novel biomarker molecules or molecular signatures with potential value in clinical practice. A future direction of “omics”-driven research in OC is also discussed.
Methods
Studies on “omics”-based approaches [genomics/proteomics/transcriptomics/metabolomics] were investigated for differentiating oral squamous cell carcinoma,oral sub-mucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, oral erythroplakia from normal cases. Electronic databases viz., PubMed, Springer, and Google Scholar were searched.
Results
One eighty-one studies were included in this review. The review shows that the fields of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-based marker identification have implemented advanced tools to screen early changes in DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite expression in OC population.
Conclusions
It may be concluded that despite advances in OC therapy, symptomatic presentation occurs at an advanced stage, where various curative treatment options become very limited. A molecular level study is essential for detecting an OC biomarker at an early stage. Modern “Omics” strategies can potentially make a major contribution to meet this need.

AB  - “Product oriented” companies need to integrate new functions and services that are “user friendly” in order to stay relevant in the market. The growing data produced to support the development and the exploitation of these products, requires them to go within a Product Lifecycle Management or to modify it to take into account new needs. Most of time this leads to use disruptive technologies and innovative mindsets in order to well align tool market capabilities to industry businesses. The approach presented in this paper contributes to identify the product lifecycle management as an end-product composed of several compounds which can be managed within a system engineering process. The system engineering framework is used to propose a comprehensive picture of the operational, functional and structural breakdown need for the Product Lifecycle Management deployment.

AB  - Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a new phenomenon reported worldwide with temporal association with Covid-19. The objective of this paper is to evaluate reported cases in children and adolescents. From 1726 papers, 35 documented papers related to MIS-C cases identified 783 individual cases of MIS-C between March-June 2020; with 55% being male (n = 435) and a median age of 8.6 years (IQR, 7–10 years; range 3 months–20 years). Patients with MIS-C were noted to have a high frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms (71%) including abdominal pain (34%) and diarrhea (27%). Cough and respiratory distress were reported in 4.5% and 9.6% cases respectively. Blood parameters showed neutrophilia in 345/418 (83%) of cases and a high CRP in 587/626 (94%). 362/619 (59%) cases were SARS-CoV-2 infection positive (serology or PCR) however only 41% demonstrated pulmonary changes on chest imaging. Severity of illness was high with 68% cases requiring intensive care admission; 63% requiring inotropic support; 244/783 (28%) cases needing some form of respiratory support (138 mechanically ventilated), and 31 required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Treatment strategies included intravenous immunoglobulin (63%) and intravenous steroids (44%). 29 cases received Infliximab, 47 received IL1 (interleukin) receptor antagonist, and 47 received IL6-receptor antagonist. 12/783 (1.5%) children died. In summary, a higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms were noted in MIS-C. In contrast to acute Covid-19 infection in children, MIS-C appears to be a condition of higher severity with 68% of cases having required critical care support.

AB  - Dental glass-ceramics (DGCs) are developed by controlled crystallization of oxide glasses and form an important group of biomaterials used in modern dentistry. They are also of great importance to scientists studying the fundamentals of crystallization. DGCs must meet strict requirements for restorative prostheses and to streamline the workflow for dentists and increase patient comfort. Considerable research has been devoted to developing new DGCs using advanced technologies, such as CAD/CAM or 3D printing, and to improve material properties. DGCs are designed to have exceptional aesthetics, translucency, high strength, chemical durability, wear resistance, biocompatibility, low thermal conductivity, and hardness similar to that of natural teeth. Some are also bioactive to stimulate a favorable response from the tooth and supporting bone. This allows treatment of hypersensitivity, regeneration of alveolar bone, and healing of periodontal tissues. In this comprehensive and critical review, we compare (inert) restorative prostheses and bioactive GCs. We elaborate on the relevant theoretical fundamentals of crystallization in oxide glasses and explain key technologies to fabricate DGCs. Advanced experimental techniques to unveil the details of crystallization in DGCs are thoroughly discussed. Finally, we propose a strategy for adopting advanced technologies, characterization tools, theoretical insights, and computer models to advance this important field.

AB  - Introduction
IgG4 related disease is a fibroinflammatory condition characterised by lymphoplasmocytic infiltration with predominance of IgG4+ plasma cells, fibrosis, and in most cases elevated IgG4 serum levels. It can affect any organ and result in varying clinical manifestations. Steroids are the cornerstone of treatment, however there is a high percentage of relapse. Recent studies have demonstrated favourable effects with rituximab.
Objective
To evaluate effectiveness related to the response to treatment with rituximab in patients with IgG4 related disease refractory to steroids and other immunosuppressant therapies.
Materials and methods
We undertook a systematic search of the specialist databases EMBASE, LILACS, PUBMED and OVID-Cochrane for publications up until December 2017.
Results
After the quality analysis, we selected 27 articles (264 patients in total) for the final review, of which 23 were case reports and case series (105 patients), 3 were observational follow-up cohort studies (129 patients), and there was one clinical trial (30 patients). IgG4 related disease presents predominantly in male patients aged between 50 and 70 years on average. Multiple organs are compromised with an average of 3.5 compromised organs. Orbital, glandular and lymph-node compromise is most frequent. Patients in the different studies we included had received various treatments prior to starting rituximab, including glucocorticoids and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. There was 90.7% response in the cases where rituximab was used as second line therapy; rituximab was used as first line treatment for 10% of the patients with a 100% response rate.
Conclusion
The use of rituximab for patients refractory to first-line treatments was associated with a high response percentage and less dependence on glucocorticoids.
Resumen
Introducción
La enfermedad relacionada con IgG4 es una condición fibroinflamatoria caracterizada por infiltración linfoplasmocítica con predominio de células plasmáticas IgG4+, fibrosis y en la mayoría de los casos niveles séricos elevados de IgG4. Puede afectar cualquier órgano y llevar a manifestaciones clínicas variables. El tratamiento con esteroides es la piedra angular, sin embargo, el porcentaje de recidivas es alto. Estudios recientes han mostrado efectos favorables con rituximab.
Objetivo
Evaluar la efectividad relacionada con la respuesta al tratamiento con rituximab en los pacientes con enfermedad relacionada con IgG4 refractarios a uso de esteroides y otras terapias inmunosupresoras.
Materiales y métodos
Se realizó una búsqueda sistemática en bases de datos especializadas EMBASE, LILACS, PUBMED y OVID-Cochrane de publicaciones hasta diciembre de 2017.
Resultados
Posteriormente al análisis de calidad se seleccionaron 27 artículos (264 pacientes en total) para la revisión final de los cuales 23 correspondían a reportes de caso y series de caso (105 pacientes), 3 a estudios observacionales de seguimiento a una cohorte (129 pacientes) y un ensayo clínico (30 pacientes). La enfermedad relacionada con IgG4 se presenta predominantemente en pacientes de sexo masculino con una edad promedio entre 50 y 70 años. El compromiso orgánico es múltiple con un promedio de 3,5 órganos comprometidos, siendo lo más frecuente el compromiso orbitario, glandular y ganglionar. Los pacientes de los diferentes estudios incluidos recibieron diversos tratamientos previo al inicio de rituximab, entre ellos glucocorticoides y fármacos antirreumáticos modificadores de la enfermedad. El porcentaje de respuesta en aquellos casos donde el rituximab se empleó como terapia de segunda línea fue del 90,7%; en el 10% de los pacientes se empleó rituximab como primera línea con un porcentaje de respuesta del 100%.
Conclusión
El uso de rituximab en pacientes refractarios a terapias de primera línea se asocia a un alto porcentaje de respuesta y a menor dependencia a glucocorticoides.

AB  - Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2.75 variant emerged in May 2022. BA.2.75 is a BA.2 descendant but is phylogenetically distinct from BA.5, the currently predominant BA.2 descendant. Here, we show that BA.2.75 has a greater effective reproduction number and different immunogenicity profile than BA.5. We determined the sensitivity of BA.2.75 to vaccinee and convalescent sera as well as a panel of clinically available antiviral drugs and antibodies. Antiviral drugs largely retained potency, but antibody sensitivity varied depending on several key BA.2.75-specific substitutions. The BA.2.75 spike exhibited a profoundly higher affinity for its human receptor, ACE2. Additionally, the fusogenicity, growth efficiency in human alveolar epithelial cells, and intrinsic pathogenicity in hamsters of BA.2.75 were greater than those of BA.2. Our multilevel investigations suggest that BA.2.75 acquired virological properties independent of BA.5, and the potential risk of BA.2.75 to global health is greater than that of BA.5.

KW  - Labor mobility
KW  - R&D intensity
KW  - Innovativeness
AB  - The software industry is unique in terms of its “platform economics” where many firms build their products based on dominant software platforms. Hiring workers from firms with high platform knowledge may thus create externalities for the recipient software firms. Yet, while prior studies have shown that hiring IT workers creates value for recipient firms, the sources of such hiring and the characteristics of recipients that increase value in the software industry are unclear. This paper contributes to the literature by uncovering that the value created through hiring IT workers in the software industry stems largely from firms that are high in platform human capital. Using a large dataset derived from an online professional network, we show that hiring platform-skilled workers from firms that are high in platform human capital is associated with a statistically and economically significant increase in financial performance of the recipient software firms. Further, the value of hiring derives from platform-skilled workers with tenure long enough at the source firms, and for recipient firms that are innovative and have high R&D intensity. We thus explicate the sources of hiring and recipient characteristics that increase value for software firms, and derive implications from the findings.

AB  - There are numerous factors affecting online retail behavior, which are discovered in the last two decades, but no previous study has compiled the scientific literature on social influence into a systematic literature review. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper evaluated available articles on social influence in online retail and developed a comprehensive model. The article critically examines the theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies (TCCM) that have been used to study the role of social influence in online retail. The Web of Science database was used, following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic inclusion and exclusion of articles. From an academic perspective, we offer four strong propositions for future researchers, such as the use of novel or advanced theoretical models, determining social influence variations based on continent versus culture and product versus service, a comprehensive conceptual model, and a higher focus on the validity, robustness, and balance of data, technique, and samples during research. We also recommend qualitative, mixed-method, or experimental approaches for future studies. From a managerial perspective, we offer some useful recommendations based on the conceptual model. This comprehensive assessment not only emphasizes earlier contributions but also creates a research roadmap for the future.

While humour research is abundant across different languages, only a small number of studies investigating cross-cultural differences in verbal humour exist. An analysis of verbal humour in monologues from four current late-night TV talk shows in Spain and the United States revealed similar use of linguistic resources such as analogies, colloquialisms, cultural references to deliver humour but with different degrees of preference. Additionally, English monologues were mostly on political satire, while Spanish humour referenced a wider variety of topics including taboo-like themes and language such as sex, drugs, or religion. Spanish monologues were also more conversational and informal in their delivery.

AB  - Room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries (RT Na-S batteries) are regarded as promising power sources particularly for grid-scale energy storage, owing to their high theoretical capacity and low-cost electrode materials. Currently, numerous studies have focused on the S-cathode. Moreover, it is identified that the dissolution/shuttle of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) in ether-based electrolytes and the grievous nucleophilic reaction in ester-based electrolytes are the most pivotal challenges for RT Na-S batteries. Nevertheless, the practical advancement of RT Na-S batteries is equally hampered by significant obstacles associated with Na anodes. This review starts with the discussion on the origin, cell chemistries and principles of RT Na-S batteries. Afterwards, severe challenges confronted by Na anodes especially in RT Na-S batteries are concluded. Then, we provide an exhaustive overview of the present stabilization strategies for Na anodes in polysulfides-rich environments, including electrolyte, interface and separator. Moreover, theoretical investigations to foundational data concerning stable NaPSs, surface structure, charge transfer kinetics and sodium deposition/dissolution dynamics in polysulfide-rich electrolytes are summarized. Finally, this article also provides suggestions on underscoring fundamental scientific challenges and considerations necessitating attention in order to promote comprehensive development of RT Na-S batteries.

AB  - In an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the existence of a huge number of heterogeneous devices, which are potentially resource-constrained and/or mobile has led to quality of service (QoS) concerns. Quality approaches have been proposed at various layers of the IoT architecture and take into consideration a number of different QoS factors. This paper evaluates the current state of the art of proposed QoS approaches in the IoT, specifically: (1) What layers of the IoT architecture have had the most research on QoS? (2) What quality factors do the quality approaches take into account when measuring performance? (3) What types of research have been conducted in this area? We have conducted a systematic mapping using a number of automated searches from the most relevant academic databases to address these questions. This mapping has identified a number of state of the art approaches which provides a good reference for researchers. The paper also identifies a number of gaps in the research literature at specific layers of the IoT architecture. It identifies which quality factors, research and contribution facets have been underutilised in the state of the art.

Justificativa e objetivos
A lombalgia é uma enfermidade prevalente na população adulta, que tem sua qualidade de vida afetada consideravelmente. Com intuito de resolver este problema, desenvolveram‐se várias terapias. Um exemplo é a ozonioterapia. Objetivamos neste estudo determinar a efetividade da ozonioterapia para alívio da dor lombar em pacientes adultos, quando comparada a outras terapias (esteroide e placebo).
Método
Usamos de ensaios clínicos randomizados para comparar a efetividade do ozônio e de outras terapias para o alívio da dor lombar em adultos (Prospero: CRD42018090807). Dois revisores independentes analisaram as bases Medline (1966‐Abril/2018), Scopus (2011‐Maio/2018), Lilacs (1982–Maio/2018) e Embase (1974–Março/2018). Como descritores, usamos termos ozone e pain. Temos como variável primária o alívio da dor e como variáveis secundárias: complicação, grau de satisfação, qualidade de vida e recorrência da dor.
Resultados
Os seis ensaios clínicos selecionados, de 779 artigos identificados, mostram que o grupo do ozônio é mais efetivo para o alívio da dor lombar, porém, foram classificados em sua maioria com alto ou incerto risco de viés (Handbook Cochrane). A metanálise referente à efetividade no alívio da dor não apresentou diferença significante entre os grupos no período de três meses (RR = 1,98; 95% IC: 0,46‐8,42; p = 0,36; 366 participantes). Também denotou maior efetividade em seis meses do grupo ozônio em relação a outras terapias (esteroide e placebo) (RR = 2,2; 95% IC: 1,87‐2,60; p < 0,00001; 717 participantes).
Conclusões
A revisão sistemática demonstrou que ozonioterapia usada por seis meses para alívio da dor lombar é mais efetiva do que outras terapias. Entretanto, esse resultado não é definitivo, visto que foram usados dados de estudos com moderado a alto risco de viés.
Background and objectives
Low back pain is a prevalent disease in the adult population, whose quality of life is considerably affected. In order to solve this problem, several therapies have been developed, of which ozone therapy is an example. Our objective in this study was to determine the effectiveness of ozone therapy for lumbar pain relief in adult patients compared to other therapies (steroid and placebo).
Method
We used randomized clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of ozone and other therapies for lumbar pain relief in adults (Prospero: CRD42018090807). Two independent reviewers searched the Medline (1966‐April/2018), Scopus (2011‐May/2018), Lilacs (1982‐May/2018), and Embase (1974‐March/2018) databases. We use the terms ozone and pain as descriptors. The primary variable was pain relief and the secondary ones were complication, degree of satisfaction, quality of life, and recurrence of pain.
Results
Of the 779 identified articles, six selected clinical trials show that ozone therapy is more effective for lumbar pain relief; however, they were mostly classified as having a high or uncertain risk of bias (Cochrane Handbook). The meta‐analysis regarding the effectiveness of pain relief did not show a significant difference between groups in the three‐month period (RR = 1.98, 95% CI: 0.46–8.42, p = 0.36; 366 participants). It also showed greater effectiveness of the ozone therapy at six months compared to other therapies (steroid and placebo) (RR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.87–2.60, p < 0.00001; 717 participants).
Conclusions
The systematic review has shown that ozone therapy used for six months for lumbar pain relief is more effective than other therapies; however, this result is not definitive as data from studies with moderate to high risk of bias were used.

AB  - COVID-19 has posed a severe challenge on food security by limiting access to food for the marginally placed population. While access to food is a challenge, access to nutritional food is a greater challenge to the population. The present-day foods are not sufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of the human body. In a pandemic condition, providing nutritious food to the population is imperative to ensure the health and well-being of humankind. Exploiting the existing biodiversity of crop species and deploying classical and modern tools to improve the nutritional potential of these species holds the key to addressing the above challenge. Breeding has been a classical tool of crop improvement that relied predominantly on genetic diversity. Collecting and conserving diverse germplasms and characterizing their diversity using molecular markers is essential to preserve diversity and use them in genetic improvement programs. These markers are also valuable for association mapping analyses to identify the genetic determinants of traits-of-interest in crop species. Association mapping identifies the quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the trait-of-interest by exploring marker-trait associations, and these QTLs can further be exploited for the genetic improvement of cultivated species through genomics-assisted breeding. Conventional breeding and genomics approaches are also being applied to develop biofortified cereal crops to reduce nutritional deficiencies in consumers. In this context, chapter explains the prerequisites for association mapping, population structure, genetic diversity, different approaches of performing association mapping to dissect nutritional traits, use the information for genomics-assisted breeding for nutrient-rich cereal crops, and application of genomics strategies in crop biofortification. These approaches will ensure food and nutrition security for all amidst the current COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - This research responds to the call on global convergence in the international business management domain. Global convergence requires new evolutionary, devolutionary and even revolutionary strategies that are framed in the context of digital transformation. The digital transformation phenomenon has led to different theoretical and managerial perspectives on disruptive technologies provoking the need for more studies on the integration of such technologies within SMEs ecosystem-based business models (EBBMs). In this vein, by adopting a micro-level lens, this research examines 718 managers from SMEs in Europe who have already embraced the digital transformation process and have bonded physical and digital ecosystems. The results are analysed through the application of logistic regression analysis. A notable contribution of this study is the development of a new model which articulates the relationship between substantive capability, adaptation capability and change capability in the SME. The study articulates how these work, support and facilitate disruptive technology integration in EBBM and suggests a method for their evaluation. As emerged the consideration that DCs are not replicable is supported and so it has been shown that technologies cannot replace human beings in their transformation business capabilities. This addresses the evolutionary change of global convergence generated by disruptive technologies that: 1. empower individual skills; 2. develops renewed strategies for enhancing network capabilities and; 3. allows the exploring and exploiting of opportunities from the influence of EBBM.

AB  - The integration of AI technology with digital transformation has profoundly shaped the evolution towards digital triplet architecture, grounded in human-centric methodologies. By infusing human intellectual activities into both physical and cyberspace, innovative links between humans and machines are established. Despite limitations in transitioning from tangible human presence to the digital realm in cyberspace, extensive efforts are underway to harness emotional, visual, and oral responses, thereby enhancing the reasoning and predictive capabilities of digital twins. These advancements aim to elevate real-time human interactions with physical and virtual systems by integrating intelligent AI algorithms and cognitive computing systems into digital twins. This paper meticulously analyses recent trends in digital twins, tracing their evolution from traditional concepts and applications to a nuanced digital triplet hierarchy that incorporates human intuition, knowledge, and creativity within cyberspace. we delve into the hierarchical framework of the digital triplet, resonating with maturity, domination, and volition levels, enhances cognitive and perceptual capabilities in cyberspace. The study provides a systematic overview of the development of ultra-realistic digital models, incorporating real-time data-driven artefacts that integrate intelligent activities with multidomain, multiphysics, and multiscale simulations. The research scope is focused on augmenting the perceptive and heuristic capabilities of the digital triplet framework by utilizing AI in data analytics, retrieving heterogeneous data from virtual entities using semantic artificial intelligence technologies, and amalgamating AI and machine learning with human insight and perceptual knowledge. The proposed digital triplet hierarchy aims to enhance cyberspace's capacity for learning, cognitive skills, and knowledge transfer. It can be a guideline for the researcher to promote cognitive augmentation of the human brain through brain-machine/computer interface, virtual, augmented, and extended reality, fostering a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines in the industrial metaverse and industry 5.0. The paper discusses future directions for research and the challenges involved in developing intelligent digital twins towards the digital triplet paradigm, aiming to embody intelligent activities and cognitive capabilities within the framework of human–machine symbiosis.

AB  - Research attention on decentralized autonomous energy systems has increased exponentially in the past three decades, as demonstrated by the absolute number of publications and the share of these studies in the corpus of energy system modelling literature. This paper shows the status quo and future modelling needs for research on local autonomous energy systems. A total of 359 studies are investigated, of which a subset of 123 in detail. The studies are assessed with respect to the characteristics of their methodology and applications, in order to derive common trends and insights. Most case studies apply to middle-income countries and only focus on the supply of electricity in the residential sector. Furthermore, many of the studies are comparable regarding objectives and applied methods. Local energy autonomy is associated with high costs, leading to levelized costs of electricity of 0.41 $/kWh on average. By analysing the studies, many improvements for future studies could be identified: the studies lack an analysis of the impact of autonomous energy systems on surrounding energy systems. In addition, the robust design of autonomous energy systems requires higher time resolutions and extreme conditions. Future research should also develop methodologies to consider local stakeholders and their preferences for energy systems.

AB  - The paper aims to highlight the degree of diffusion and the intensity of use of knowledge management systems (KMSs) among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and to propose a taxonomy that synthesises the strategies of using KMSs on the part of SMEs. Starting from a literature review on KMSs used by SMEs and from a focus group with consultants/researchers operating in the field of information technology in SMEs, an empirical investigation was designed, developed and conducted through semi-structured interviews involving 61 selected SMEs operating in high tech industries. The paper highlights three main issues regarding the use of KMSs. Firstly, SMEs adopt and use more intensively traditional tools (KM-Tools) rather than new and more updated ones that are generally cheaper and easier to use. Secondly, SMEs adopt and make more intensive use of practices (KM-Practices) that do not exclusively focus on the knowledge management process, but seek to adapt practices they already know to the requirements of knowledge management. Finally, the paper points out that there is a relationship of reciprocity between KM-Tools and KM-Practices: one reinforces the other and vice versa. The paper proposes a taxonomy bringing together SME strategies for using KMSs. Specifically, four strategies are identified: guidepost, explorer, exploiter, and latecomer.

Objetivo
Realizar una revisión de la literatura para analizar si la estimulación de puntos de acupuntura aumenta la cantidad de leche producida durante la lactancia.
Método
Se recopilaron estudios de cinco bases de datos electrónicas siguiendo las recomendaciones internacionales para la elaboración de revisiones sistemáticas y metaanálisis. Los criterios de elegibilidad fueron artículos de texto completo en inglés o español con diseño de ensayos clínicos y estudios observacionales, sin restricción en el tiempo de publicación, en los cuales se hubiera evaluado el efecto de la estimulación de puntos de acupuntura en la mejora de la cantidad de lactancia mediante acupuntura convencional, electroacupuntura, láser, agujas de fuego, estimulación manual, Tui Na o catgut. Dos autores extrajeron de forma independiente los datos de las características y los resultados principales de los estudios seleccionados para su inclusión. Se realizaron las evaluaciones de riesgo de sesgo y de calidad (GRADE). Para la síntesis cuantitativa se calculó la diferencia de medias estandarizada para cada estudio individual seleccionado y luego se combinaron los datos mediante un metaanálisis de efectos aleatorios.
Resultados
En la presente revisión se incluyeron un total de 14 estudios, la mayoría de ellos mostraron riesgo de sesgo y una calidad moderada. El metaanálisis mostró que la estimulación manual del punto de acupuntura aumenta la cantidad de leche materna (DME 95% IC=1,63 [1,13-2,13]; p<0,0001).
Conclusión
La literatura sugiere que la estimulación manual de puntos de acupuntura mejora la cantidad de leche producida durante de lactancia.
Objective
To perform a literature review aimed to analyze if acupoint stimulation increases lactation quantity.
Method
Studies were collected from five electronic databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria were full-text articles in English or Spanish with clinical trial design and observational studies, with no restriction on time of publication, in which the effect of acupoint stimulation on improving the quantity of lactation by conventional acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser, fire needling, manual stimulation, tuina or catgut had been evaluated. Two authors independently extracted data for the characteristics and main outcomes of the studies selected for inclusion. The risk of bias (RoB 2 and Robins-I) and the quality assessments (GRADE) were performed. For the quantitative synthesis, the standardized mean difference was calculated for each individual study selected and then the data were combined using a random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 14 studies were included in the present review. Most of the included studies exhibited some concerns in the risk of bias assessment. The quality of the studies was moderate. The meta-analysis showed that manual acupoint stimulation improves the lactation quantity (SMD 95% CI=1.63 [1.13-2.13]; p<0.0001).
Conclusion
The literature suggests that manual stimulation of acupuncture points improves the amount of milk produced during lactation.

Our article attempts to assess the research question how multiple stakeholders implement digital technologies for management and business purposes. To answer this question, we perform a systematic literature review about the state of the art of digital transformation in healthcare. Our findings show that prior research falls into five clusters: operational efficiency by healthcare providers; patient-centered approaches; organizational factors and managerial implications; workforce practices; and socio-economic aspects. These clusters are linked together into a model showing how these various forms of technology implementation lead to operational efficiencies for services providers. Various directions for future research and management implications are offered.

AB  - Smart manufacturing has recently become the industry’s buzzword, with the promise of improved performance and greater agility. Also named Industry 4.0 (I4), this concept relies upon a system of systems made of myriads of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) components. Along with the expected enhancements come new cyber-threats as the attack surface and pathways will increase. This conference paper argues that I4’s cyber resilience demands an ad hoc research programme. Firstly, we briefly compare Operations Technology (OT) with classic Information Technology (IT) and IoT technology to highlight their differences and the latters’ impact on cyber resilience. Secondly, we depict the concept of operation of future I4 systems and point out the specific challenges they raise. Next, we review the concept of through-life cyber resilience assurance and complement the list of future I4 environments’ challenges. Fourthly, we present Cranfield University’s Manufacturing Informatics Centre’s (MIC) research & education strategy and show how it relates to the identified challenges. In our conclusion, we suggest ways to foster collaboration between the Industry, the Government and the MIC to address these challenges and to allow the United Kingdom to approach I4’s challenges with increased confidence.

AB  - Hypothesis
While controlled and efficient exfoliation of layered oxides often remains a time consuming challenge, the surface modification of inorganic nanosheets is of outmost importance for future applications. The functionalization of the bulk material prior to exfoliation should allow the application of tools developped for Van der Waals materials to directly produce functionalized oxide nanosheets.
Experiments
The Aurivillius phase Bi2SrTa2O9 is functionalized by a linear aliphatic phosphonic acid via microwave-assisted reactions. The structure of the hybrid material and the coordination of the phosphonate group is scrutinized, notably by Pair Distribution Function. This functionalized layered oxide is then exfoliated in one hour in organic solvent, using high shear force dispersion. The obtained nanosheets are characterized in suspension and as deposits to check their chemical integrity.
Findings
The covalent functionalization decreases the electrostatic cohesion between the inorganic layers leading to an efficient exfoliation in short time under shearing. The functionalization of the bulk material is preserved on the nanosheets upon exfoliation and plays a major role to enable liquid-phase exfoliation and in the stability of the resulting suspensions. This strategy is very promising for the straighforward preparation of functionalized nanosheets, paving the way for versatile design of new (multi)functional hybrid nanosheets for various potential applications.

AB  - Zero Energy Building (ZEB) is gaining more attention as a solution to significantly mitigate the environment concerns. However, a bibliometric analysis of the topic, a very useful method to analyze the database of published publications and reviews, is lacking. Especially, to provide when and how this concept has been brought out, insights into the state-of-art technology, the findings of the collaboration networks and the challenges of ZEB. To address this gap, in this paper, ZEB studies have been reviewed using multiple perspectives and analytical tools, such as VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to analyze the collaboration networks and the thematic trends of ZEB publications. The original data was retrieved in Scopus, a total of 1051 documents including research articles and reviews published from 1976 to 2020. The analysis of the number of publications over the years shows that the development of Zero energy building research has gone through three stages: a slow development period from 1076 to 1999, followed by a development from 2000 to 2010 and finally a rapid development from 2011 to 2020. The study also reveals different rankings, including the most widely collaborated scholars, the most cited scholars, the most published countries, etc. Therein, the United State, United Kingdom and China have the most research on ZEB. Based on the analysis of co-occurrence network and evolution of thematic keywords, it is found that energy efficiency and life cycle assessment (LCA) are the main challenges for the achievement of ZEB target. Finally, these challenges have been discussed and solutions provided.

These initiatives include transnational sustainable certification schemes, such as the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and national level sustainability standards, such as Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil. To date, attempts to find consensus on sustainable policy and processes has been characterised by tension and disagreement. Most notably, stakeholders participating in policy dialogue from producing countries are unsatisfied with the outcomes of transnational palm oil governance. Tension stems from observations that sustainability is understood differently in the palm oil producing countries of the Global South compared with Northern consumption markets. To understand the different framings of palm oil and potential governance solutions, we investigate media coverage of palm oil sustainability in two different countries: the Netherlands – the largest importer of palm oil in Europe – and Malaysia – the second largest exporter of palm oil in the world after Indonesia. From a sample of 397 Malaysian and Dutch newspaper articles between 2000 and 2015, we employ framing analysis to examine the similarities and differences in media representations of palm oil sustainability. Our findings reveal considerable differences in the way palm oil sustainability is framed in the two countries. Malaysian media frame palm oil as a sustainable industry yet underpinned by a distrust towards transnational sustainability governance (e.g. RSPO) and a perception of unfair treatment towards producing countries by the West. Conversely, Dutch media frame the West as proud consumers of palm oil, who are driving up sustainability standards through NGO scrutiny and participation in transnational processes. We argue that a comparative analysis of media frames offers instructive insights for understanding processes of transnational sustainability governance. In particular, we posit that reconciling policy tensions between North and South palm oil stakeholders could be achieved by highlighting the differences in sustainability framings at different points in the value chain to identify contestation and consensus.

AB  - Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in improving fertilization rates compared to conventional in vitro fertilization rates (IVF) among women aged ≥38 years with a non−male factor diagnosis.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Setting
Not applicable.
Patient(s)
Women aged ≥38 years with a non−male factor diagnosis receiving IVF or ICSI.
Intervention(s)
A systematic review of databases including PubMed and Embase was performed. Study protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Studies were selected if they compared fertilization rates from ICSI with those from conventional IVF among women aged ≥38 years with a non−male factor infertility diagnosis. A random effects model was used. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were applied.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Fertilization rate.
Results
Seven studies including 8796 retrieved oocytes (ICSI: 4,369; IVF: 4,427) with mean female age ≥38 years met the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in fertilization rates between ICSI and conventional IVF (relative risk [RR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93−1.06; P = .8). Heterogeneity was observed between studies (I2 = 58.2; P < .05). Heterogeneity was significant (I2 = 57.1; P < .05) when cycles with prior fertilization failure were excluded; however, when analysis was restricted to poor responders (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97–1.05; P = .6), heterogeneity was no longer significant (I2 = 0.0; P = .5).
Conclusions
No difference was found in fertilization rates between conventional IVF and ICSI. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of ICSI in this population, controlling for other indications such as preimplantation genetic testing.

Intervención (es)
Se realizó una revisión sistemática de las bases de datos incluidas en PubMed y Embase. El protocolo de estudio fue registrado en el Registro Internacional Prospectivo de Revisiones Sistemáticas. Los estudios fueron seleccionados si se comparaban las tasas de fecundación de ICSI con la conseguida con FIV convencional en mujeres ≥ 38 años sin diagnóstico de factor masculino. Se utilizó un modelo de efectos aleatorios. Se aplicaron las pautas de meta análisis de estudios observacionales en epidemiología.
Principal medida de resultado
Tasa de fecundación.
Resultados
Cumplieron con los criterios de inclusión 7 estudios con 8796 ovocitos (ICSI: 4,369; FIV: 4,427) con una edad media de la mujer de ≥ 38 años. No hubo diferencias significativas en la tasa de fecundación entre ICSI y el FIV convencional (riesgo relativo [RR] 0.99, 95% intervalo de confianza [CI] 0.93-1.06; P=.8). Se observó heterogeneidad entre estudios (I2 = 58.2; P < .05). La heterogeneidad fue significativa (I2 = 57.1; P < .05) cuando los ciclos con fallo de fecundación previo fueron excluidos; sin embargo, cuando el análisis fue restringido a baja respondedoras (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05; P=.6), la heterogeneidad ya no fue significativa (I2 = 0.0; P =.5).
Conclusiones
No se encontró diferencia en las tasas de fecundación entre FIV convencional e ICSI. Se necesitan más estudios para valorar el impacto del ICSI en esta población, controlando otras indicaciones como el test diagnóstico preimplantacional.

AB  - Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome observed in 2–5 % of thymomas. Literature reports great variability in its management. Based on an illustrative clinical case, we present a systematic literature review whose main objective is to evaluate the therapeutic management of PRCA. The literature search was performed based on the PICO method in the Medline and Scopus databases. The reference clinical case concerns a 51-year-old woman with stage IVa thymoma. After initial response to chemotherapy, a locoregional progression occurred with PRCA development that responded favorably under second line chemotherapy. The patient finally died in a context of bicytopenia with febrile neutropenia. The systematic review covers 135 articles published between 1950 and 2019. Thymectomy alone or in combination with other therapies showed a 31 % complete remission (CR) rate for PRCA of, whereas none was reported with anti-tumor treatments without thymectomy. Among immunomodulatory therapies, cyclosporin gave the highest percentage of CR (74 %). Finally, the combination of thymectomy and immunomodulatory treatments showed a CR rate of 45 %. Thymectomy appeared to be the most effective anti-tumor treatment for PRCA. Immunomodulatory therapies, particularly cyclosporine, are shown effective, but the risk of infectious complications must be considered. The optimal place of anti-tumor and immunomodulatory therapies against PRCA has yet to be determined.

AB  - With the advent of Web 2.0, there exist many online platforms that results in massive textual data production such as social networks, online blogs, magazines etc. This textual data carries information that can be used for betterment of humanity. Hence, there is a dire need to extract potential information out of it. This study aims to present an overview of approaches that can be applied to extract and later present these valuable information nuggets residing within text in brief, clear and concise way. In this regard, two major tasks of automatic keyword extraction and text summarization are being reviewed. To compile the literature, scientific articles were collected using major digital computing research repositories. In the light of acquired literature, survey study covers early approaches up to all the way till recent advancements using machine learning solutions. Survey findings conclude that annotated benchmark datasets for various textual data-generators such as twitter and social forms are not available. This scarcity of dataset has resulted into relatively less progress in many domains. Also, applications of deep learning techniques for the task of automatic keyword extraction are relatively unaddressed. Hence, impact of various deep architectures stands as an open research direction. For text summarization task, deep learning techniques are applied after advent of word vectors, and are currently governing state-of-the-art for abstractive summarization. Currently, one of the major challenges in these tasks is semantic aware evaluation of generated results.

AB  - Non-market valuation (NMV) can be effective to understand the value people place on ecosystem goods and services for which there are no market prices. Over the last 20 years, NMV has increasingly been applied to Indigenous contexts, albeit with important conceptual and methodological limitations. We conduct a global systematic literature review and detailed meta-synthesis of 63 peer-reviewed studies on NMV research applied to Indigenous peoples’ values. Selected studies are categorized by methods, year of publication, geographic area and ecosystem components. Australia (n = 19), the USA (n = 9) and Canada(n = 8) account for over half of all articles. Important knowledge gaps remain in the NMV peer–reviewed literature for other geographic areas. Our taxonomy based on ‘whose values’ and ‘which values’ reveals that a large proportion of studies (n = 24) focused on values held by Indigenous peoples, predominately on direct-use values (n = 12) and total economic values (n = 10). Studies based on the general population (n = 17) typically examined altruistic and/or existence values (n = 15). Our analysis identified seven main strategies used by previous studies to overcome critical limitations of NMV when applied to Indigenous peoples’ values. Strategies include: (1) engaging directly and ethically with Indigenous peoples; (2) investigating multi-dimensional values; (3)valuing health benefits; (4) adopting non-monetary payment vehicles; (5) using market prices for valuation; (6) sampling the broad population; and (7) investigating non-cumulative values. Based on this review, we provide seven critical questions to guide future NMV research: (1) What is the purpose?; (2)How does Indigenous knowledge inform NMV?; (3) Who benefits?, (4) What ethical frameworks apply?; (5) Whose values are considered?; (6) What is the expected change?; and (7) How are NMV limitations handled? Our contribution provides researchers and policy-makers with the most up-to-date review of the state-of-knowledge and suggestions for best-practice on the use of NMV methods when applied to Indigenous peoples’ values.

AB  - The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.

AB  - The number of studies on the marketing–finance interface has escalated in response to increased interest in the value of marketing investments, such as sports sponsorship. This study integrates current research findings and establishes empirical generalizations on how sports sponsorship announcements impact firm value. The empirical literature finds contradicting results on the value shareholders place on these marketing investments. This paper addresses this issue by undertaking a meta-analysis on stock reactions to sport sponsorship announcements, using 3192 of these announcements taken from 36 studies (41 samples). On aggregate, these announcements drew the attention of shareholders since there was a positive and significant cumulative abnormal return (CAR). However, this positive effect was mostly observed in the 1990s and became negative in the 2000s. Overall, shareholders viewed sports sponsorship investments favorably when there was a functional and geographical congruence between sponsors and sponsees. This paper also shows that the differences in the CAR can be explained by controlling for confounding events and host country. The paper concludes by providing potential avenues for further research in sports sponsorship, using the event study method.
