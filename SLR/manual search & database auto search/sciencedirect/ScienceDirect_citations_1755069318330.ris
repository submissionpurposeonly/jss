AB  - This chapter reviews the remote sensing of buried utilities by mobile sensor arrays and describes uses of today’s commercial devices in mapping utilities during the design, engineering, construction, monitoring, and servicing of civil infrastructure. Our survey concentrates on techniques using electromagnetic (EM) waves to probe a few meters underground with sensors placed just above the ground, either to passively record the slowly varying magnetic fields emanating from buried power lines or to actively transmit and record EM induction (EMI) signals at kilohertz frequencies and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) at megahertz to gigahertz frequencies. These technologies have improved dramatically in the last 20 years by combining broadband sensors with modern positioning systems, sophisticated signal processing, and three-dimensional (3D) visualization. The main advances since publication of the first edition of this work in 2014 have come in hardware, with faster electronics now available to digitize radar signals at nearly gigahertz (GHz) frequencies in real time—thereby enabling a new generation of sensor arrays which can move with traffic. In addition, more accurate standards and improved geographic positioning systems are pushing subsurface utility engineering (SUE) into the realm of comprehensive 3D mapping which favors integrated sensor arrays. The capabilities of commercially available array systems are described; field examples from several different sites and applications are shown.

AB  - Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is one of the most versatile thermoplastics because it is compounded with a variety of additives to produce materials suitable for an extensive range of applications. By the 1970s, it was manufactured worldwide, and was one of the largest tonnage plastics. At that time there were health and environmental concerns about PVC manufacture and additives. In Europe, organizations with PVC interests worked together toward a voluntary commitment, known as Vinyl 2010, to improve the environmental profile of PVC. PVC sustainability is now an important consideration worldwide. This chapter reviews polymerization methods, structure, compounding, properties, and processing of both rigid and flexible PVC. Additives are considered in detail, particularly stabilizers, essential in PVC processing due to the inherent instability of PVC, and plasticizers which are used to reduce the glass transition temperature to produce flexible products. Some typical formulations for particular applications are included. PVC products are used for a variety of applications including construction, transport, health care, and sports and leisure products.

AB  - Many-objective truss structure problems from small to large-scale problems with low to high design variables are investigated in this study. Mass, compliance, first natural frequency, and buckling factor are assigned as objective functions. Since there are limited optimization methods that have been developed for solving many-objective truss optimization issues, it is important to assess modern algorithms performance on these issues to develop more effective techniques in the future. Therefore, this study contributes by investigating the comparative performance of eighteen well-established algorithms, in various dimensions, using four metrics for solving challenging truss problems with many objectives. The statistical analysis is performed based on the objective function best mean and standard deviation outcomes, and Friedman's rank test. MMIPDE is the best algorithm as per the overall comparison, while SHAMODE with whale optimisation approach and SHAMODE are the runners-up.•A comparative test to measure the efficiency of eighteen state-of-the-practice methods is performed.•Small to large-scale truss design challenges are proposed for the validation.•The performance is measured using four metrics and Friedman's rank test.

AB  - Mobile app development is hindered by device fragmentation and vendor-specific modifications. Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing. Therefore, additional support for app developers is warranted.

AB  - Context
Continuous integration (CI) is a practice that aims to continuously verify quality aspects of a software intensive system both for functional and non-functional requirements (NFRs). Functional requirements are the inputs of development and can be tested in isolation, utilising either manual or automated tests. In contrast, some NFRs are difficult to test without functionality, for NFRs are often aspects of functionality and express quality aspects. Lacking this testability attribute makes NFR testing complicated and, therefore, underrepresented in industrial practice. However, the emergence of CI has radically affected software development and created new avenues for software quality evaluation and quality information acquisition. Research has, consequently, been devoted to the utilisation of this additional information for more efficient and effective NFR verification.
Objective
We aim to identify the state-of-the-art of utilising the CI environment for NFR testing, hereinafter referred to as CI-NFR testing.
Method
Through rigorous selection, from an initial set of 747 papers, we identified 47 papers that describe how NFRs are tested in a CI environment. Evidence-based analysis, through coding, is performed on the identified papers in this SLR.
Results
Firstly, ten CI approaches are described by the papers selected, each describing different tools and nine different NFRs where reported to be tested. Secondly, although possible, CI-NFR testing is associated with eight challenges that adversely affect its adoption. Thirdly, the identified CI-NFR testing processes are tool-driven, but there is a lack of NFR testing tools that can be used in the CI environment. Finally, we proposed a CI framework for NFRs testing.
Conclusion
A synthesised CI framework is proposed for testing various NFRs, and associated CI tools are also mapped. This contribution is valuable as results of the study also show that CI-NFR testing can help improve the quality of NFR testing in practices.

KW  - Tertiary systematic review
AB  - Refactoring and smells have been well researched by the software-engineering research community these past decades. Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support. In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018. We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work. Thus, we want to highlight the gap between code smells and refactoring in the current state of software-engineering research. We wish that this work could help the software-engineering research community in collaborating on future work on code smells and refactoring.

AB  - Self-healing polymeric coating is a class of self-healing materials applied on the surface of a metal to provide a dense barrier, to protect the metal from the corrosive environment. Currently, Self-healing polymer materials are an emerging area of research due to their high attributes, including intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms with autonomous/non-autonomous healing approaches, longer lifespan, eco-friendly, high durability, and sustainability. The polymer coating matrix provides the efficient release of incorporated self-healing agents after triggering due to the crack formation in the polymer matrix, which aids the self-healing performance of the polymeric matrices. A variety of studies have been reported in the literature on self-healing coating matrices; however, none of them have been reported as such. This comprehensive review covers; (1) the generations of self-healing, (2) types of mechanisms, (3) classification based on self-healing polymer matrices, (4) typical fabrication techniques, (5) potential applications, and some critical thoughts on the choice and design of the self-healing system.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the very recently approved national Member States’ laws that have implemented the GDPR in the field of automated decision-making (prohibition, exceptions, safeguards): all national legislations have been analysed and in particular 9 Member States Law address the case of automated decision making providing specific exemptions and relevant safeguards, as requested by Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR (Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, the United Kingdom, Ireland). The approaches are very diverse: the scope of the provision can be narrow (just automated decisions producing legal or similarly detrimental effects) or wide (any decision with a significant impact) and even specific safeguards proposed are very diverse. After this overview, this article will also address the following questions: are Member States free to broaden the scope of automated decision-making regulation? Are ‘positive decisions’ allowed under Article 22, GDPR, as some Member States seem to affirm? Which safeguards can better guarantee rights and freedoms of the data subject? In particular, while most Member States refers just to the three safeguards mentioned at Article 22(3) (i.e. subject's right to express one's point of view; right to obtain human intervention; right to contest the decision), three approaches seem very innovative: a) some States guarantee a right to legibility/explanation about the algorithmic decisions (France and Hungary); b) other States (Ireland and United Kingdom) regulate human intervention on algorithmic decisions through an effective accountability mechanism (e.g. notification, explanation of why such contestation has not been accepted, etc.); c) another State (Slovenia) require an innovative form of human rights impact assessments on automated decision-making.

AB  - Due to the damage they have caused to the ozone layer, first-generation refrigerants known as chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out, and second-generation refrigerants known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons are being phased out. Third-generation refrigerants known as hydrofluorocarbons are also being phased out due to their high global warming potential. As successors to the above three generations of refrigerants, hydrofluoroolefins and hydrochlorofluoroolefins were designed and created in laboratories. They have been attracting increasing research interest because they are safe and environmentally friendly. In this paper, various aspects of the recent research on hydrofluoroolefin and hydrochlorofluoroolefin refrigerants, including applications in refrigeration systems and heat pump systems, applications in organic Rankine cycles, flow patterns and heat transfer characteristics, thermophysical properties, persistent degradation product, toxicity, flammability and ignitability, thermal stability and decomposition mechanisms, are reviewed and discussed. The most commonly studied hydrofluoroolefins are still HFO-1234yf and HFO-1234ze(E). HFO-1336mzz(Z) is also worthy of further attention because it may be a suitable replacement for HFC-123. Attempts can be made to establish a dedicated equation of state for commonly used hydrofluoroolefins to better predict the thermodynamic properties. Further studies on the persistent degradation product, toxicity, flammability and ignitability, thermal stability and decomposition mechanism are needed.

AB  - The Sustainable Product-Service Systems are a promising approach based on a Triple Bottom Line perspective of the sustainability. However, its practical and effective adoption is still very limited and addresses signiﬁcant barriers for the manufacturing firms. Furthermore, this emergent topic has been discussed by literature mainly in large company’s context, turning in a very limited and immature stage the current body of knowledge for the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Thus, considering the significance of small companies to the global economy and their intrinsic difficulties, the purpose of this study was to identify the main barriers involving the transition towards Sustainable Product-Service Systems in manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises as well as the strategies to overcome them. A systematic literature review of the past two decades was organized capturing the state of the art of the area. Findings reveal that internal barriers associated with intrinsic characteristics of SMEs become still more sensitive during the transition (e.g., limited financial resources, the lack of competences, follower mentality and resistance to change). As well as, barriers related with the novelty of Sustainable Product-Service Systems models require new attitudes to small companies (e.g., changing mindsets from product ownership to use, replacing the value of exchange by value in use involving long-term relations, understanding the Product-Service Systems concept) and particularly highlight the lack of models/methods supporting this transition. The practical contribution of this study is in organise a comprehensive body of knowledge on strategies to overcome barriers towards Sustainable Product-Service offering. Moreover, an innovative decision matrix supporting decision-makers during the Sustainable Product-Service System development was proposed from the literature review findings.

AB  - Blockchain (BC) technology is gaining momentum in a variety of application domains, beyond finance. We present a text mining literature analysis of a body of published articles queried in the Scopus database, regarding BC technology and consumer trust. We applied a semiautomated text mining and topic modelling approach: we mix top-down and bottom-up procedures to align the existing literature on BC taxonomies with the gathered articles' list of keywords; we then feed automatically the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm to uncover relevant topics enabling to analyse the existing body of knowledge. Our analysis highlights the multidisciplinary nature of BC research within consumer trust. Among others, findings show pertinent aspects to consumer trust, such as traceability and privacy, are receiving only marginal attention from scholars. Our analysis also reveals the marketing, social and economic sciences’ researchers should devote efforts to the application of BC and its impact to consumer trust. We provide future research trends we deem crucial to be addressed regarding sustainable blockchain trustability.

AB  - Context:
Continuous experimentation and A/B testing is an established industry practice that has been researched for more than 10 years. Our aim is to synthesize the conducted research.
Objective:
We wanted to find the core constituents of a framework for continuous experimentation and the solutions that are applied within the field. Finally, we were interested in the challenges and benefits reported of continuous experimentation.
Methods:
We applied forward snowballing on a known set of papers and identified a total of 128 relevant papers. Based on this set of papers we performed two qualitative narrative syntheses and a thematic synthesis to answer the research questions.
Results:
The framework constituents for continuous experimentation include experimentation processes as well as supportive technical and organizational infrastructure. The solutions found in the literature were synthesized to nine themes, e.g. experiment design, automated experiments, or metric specification. Concerning the challenges of continuous experimentation, the analysis identified cultural, organizational, business, technical, statistical, ethical, and domain-specific challenges. Further, the study concludes that the benefits of experimentation are mostly implicit in the studies.
Conclusion:
The research on continuous experimentation has yielded a large body of knowledge on experimentation. The synthesis of published research presented within include recommended infrastructure and experimentation process models, guidelines to mitigate the identified challenges, and what problems the various published solutions solve.

AB  - Assembly line balancing (ALB) deals with how tasks are assigned in an assembly line to reach the required production rate and to optimize goals. Tasks in assembly line are assigned in an ordered sequence of workstations, where constraints such as precedence relations of tasks are satisfied and performance indicators are optimized. Implementing ALB could bring about optimal or semi-optimal responses that reduce initiation costs and operational costs in production systems. The purpose of this study was to analyze the contents of research papers addressing ALB and to predict the direction of future studies concerned with the ALB problems and those of U-type ALB problems. As such, this study drew on a systematic approach to reviewing the papers dealing with ALB published within 1990–2017. The papers under investigation were selected from the Web of Science database and were analyzed with aid of related software based on their content, collaboration network, and citation analysis. Through this process, the top productive countries, institutions and authors were explored. Furthermore, cooperative content analysis, keyword frequency analysis, and co-occurrence (co-word) analysis were applied to explore the current hot topics, and predict future trend of studies. This study could considerably contribute to researchers’ perspective of the research topics in the field and of the gaps that demand further investigation.

AB  - Aside2Section Authors: Gordon Roesler, Robots in Space LLC, President; and David Kornuta, United Launch Alliance, CisLunar Project Lead.2 from Earth, the inner solar system is like a vast desert where water and other volatiles are scarce. An old saying is, “In the desert, gold is useless and water is priceless.” While water is common on Earth, it is of very high value in space. Science missions to the Moon have provided direct evidence that regions near the lunar poles, which are permanently in shadow, contain substantial concentrations of water ice. On the lunar surface, water itself is critical for human consumption and radiation shielding, but water can also be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis. The oxygen thus produced can be used for life support, and hydrogen and oxygen can be combusted for rocket propulsion. Due to the Moon’s shallow gravity well, its water-derived products can be exported to fuel entirely new economic opportunities in space. This paper is the result of an examination by industry, government, and academic experts of the approach, challenges, and payoffs of a private business that harvests and processes lunar ice as the foundation of a lunar, cislunar (between the Earth and the Moon), and Earth-orbiting economy. A key assumption of this analysis is that all work—construction, operation, transport, maintenance and repair—is done by robotic systems. No human presence is required. Obtaining more data on conditions within the shadowed regions is vital to the design of a lunar ice processing plant. How much water is actually present, and at what percentage in the lunar regolith? How firm or soft are the crater bottoms, and how will that affect surface transportation? How deep is the ice resource, and in what state is it deposited amongst the regolith? These and other questions must be answered by precursor prospecting and science missions. A wide range of potential customers for the hydrogen and oxygen products has been identified. They can be used to fuel reusable landers going back and forth between the lunar surface and lunar orbit. They can make travel to Mars less expensive if the interplanetary vehicle can be refueled in cislunar space prior to departure. Operations closer to Earth can also benefit from this new, inexpensive source of propellant. Refueling in Low Earth Orbit can greatly improve the size, type, and cost of missions to Geosynchronous Earth Orbit and beyond. This study has identified a near term annual demand of 450 metric tons of lunar derived propellant equating to 2450 metric tons of processed lunar water generating $2.4 billion of revenue annually. Unlike terrestrial mining operations that utilize heavy machinery to move resources, the mass constraints of a lunar polar water mine are highly restrictive because of delivery cost. A revolutionary concept has been introduced that solves this issue. It has been discovered that instead of excavating, hauling, and processing, lightweight tents and/or heating augers can be used to extract the water resource directly out of the regolith in place. Water will be extracted from the regolith by sublimation—heating ice to convert it into water vapor without going through the liquid phase. This water vapor can then be collected on a cold surface for transport to a processing plant where electrolysis will decompose the water into its constituent parts (hydrogen and oxygen). To achieve production demand with this method, 2.8 megawatts of power is required (2 megawatts electrical and 0.8 megawatts thermal). The majority of the electrical power will be needed in the processing plant, where water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. This substantial amount of power can come from solar panels, sunlight reflected directly to the extraction site, or nuclear power. Because the bottoms of the polar craters are permanently shadowed, captured solar energy must be transported from locations of sunlight (crater rim) via power beaming or power cables. Unlike solar power sources, nuclear reactors can operate at any location; however, they generate heat that must be utilized or rejected that may be simplified if located in the cold, permanently shadowed craters. New or exotic technologies have been excluded from this study but may be incorporated into future architectures as they become available. Instead, the equipment described in this lunar propellant operation will be built from existing technologies that have been modified for the specific needs on the Moon. Surprisingly little new science is required to build this plant. Extensive testing on Earth will precede deployment to the Moon, to ensure that the robotics, extraction, chemical processing and storage all work together efficiently. The contributors to this study are those who are currently developing or have already developed the equipment required to enable this capability. From a technological perspective, a lunar propellant production plant is highly feasible. Now is the time to establish the collaborations, partnerships, and leadership that can make this new commercial enterprise a reality. Currently, no one company has all of the capabilities necessary to build the lunar plant, but the capabilities all exist within United States aerospace industry and others (such as the chemical industry). It is necessary that new or existing competing companies establish the leadership needed to coordinate the variety of technologies required for a fully integrated Commercial Lunar Propellant Architecture. Free market competition among these companies will aid in driving down costs, promoting innovation, and expanding the market. To justify such action, a secure customer base, solid business case, and high fidelity economic model is required. This too will help secure the investment required for development and implementation. The initial investment for this operation has been estimated at $4 billion, about the cost of a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. With this investment however, a scalable market can be accessed. As refueling decreases in-space transportation costs, entirely new business and exploration opportunities will emerge with potential to vastly benefit the economies of Earth. Even with the early customers identified within this study, it has been determined that this could be a profitable investment with excellent growth opportunities. The United States Government has critical roles to play in the development of this commercial capability as well. Government science/prospecting and communications missions to the Moon can be very helpful in both the development and operational phases of the business. Government laboratories can contribute some of their technologies and help facilitate integrated systems tests of a terrestrial pilot plant. Government must also work to fill the gaps in international law regarding property rights on celestial bodies such as the Moon. In addition, between Earth orbit, Moon, and Mars missions, government could be an important anchor customer for the resource, stimulating the private sector into action with proposed demands and price points while improving its mission costs and capabilities. This study demonstrates both the technical and economic feasibility of establishing a commercial lunar propellant production capability. It provides recommendations to interested government and private organizations and defines a path to implementation; and explains that by doing so the United States will fuel a new age of economic expansion, sustained space exploration, settlement, and American leadership in space.

AB  - Context
Software testability is the degree to which a software system or a unit under test supports its own testing. To predict and improve software testability, a large number of techniques and metrics have been proposed by both practitioners and researchers in the last several decades. Reviewing and getting an overview of the entire state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in this area is often challenging for a practitioner or a new researcher.
Objective
Our objective is to summarize the body of knowledge in this area and to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) in preparing, measuring and improving software testability.
Method
To address the above need, the authors conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification) to find out what we as a community know about this topic. After compiling an initial pool of 303 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 208 papers (published between 1982 and 2017).
Results
The area of software testability has been comprehensively studied by researchers and practitioners. Approaches for measurement of testability and improvement of testability are the most-frequently addressed in the papers. The two most often mentioned factors affecting testability are observability and controllability. Common ways to improve testability are testability transformation, improving observability, adding assertions, and improving controllability.
Conclusion
This paper serves for both researchers and practitioners as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in the area of testability. The results could help practitioners measure and improve software testability in their projects. To assess potential benefits of this review paper, we shared its draft version with two of our industrial collaborators. They stated that they found the review useful and beneficial in their testing activities. Our results can also benefit researchers in observing the trends in this area and identify the topics that require further investigation.

AB  - Purpose
To assess the state of supply chain management (SCM) research in India and to understand the research trends and methodologies used. The present study also aims to create a taxonomy of the subject areas researched in India.
Design/methodology/approach
The present study employed the systematic literature review methodology. Literature from 395 peer journal papers in 67 leading journals over a 20-year period (2000–2020 Quarter-1) was comprehensively reviewed and assessed.
Findings
SCM research in India started around the year 2000. The quantum of research was low (single digit) until 2010. There has been steady growth over the last decade, and over 50% of the total papers up until now has been published in the last four years. The present study created a three-tiered taxonomy of the subject areas and classified the papers as per it. The first tier (level-1) has seven categories (SCM strategy, network design, SCM processes and integration, IT systems, skills, performance measurement and others). A perusal of the newly created taxonomy revealed that, except for a few areas under level-1 categories (such as SCM processes and SCM strategy), the other level-1 categories have not seen much research. Similarly, there is little or no research in a large number of level-2 categories (such as outsourcing strategy, channel strategy, demand management, demand fulfillment, customer relationship management, integrated supply chain planning, new product development, returns, supply chain orientation, performance monitoring, performance improvement, SCM adoption process, SCM implementation issues and quantified benefits of SCM). Methodologically, the rigor of SCM research in India needs improvement.
Originality/value
A comprehensive taxonomy of SCM subject areas researched in India at three cascading levels was created for the first time in the present study. The taxonomy will help provide researchers with a clear understanding of the structure of the subject areas and help in identifying areas where research has been carried out and the subject areas where gaps exist for future research to proceed. The present study also provides an overview of the methodological rigor of SCM research in India and points out some of the limitations that researchers should avoid in future studies.

AB  - In recent times, there is a rise in the application of bonded marine hoses on floating offshore structures (FOS). These increased developments on bonded marine hoses have led to their deployment on CALM, SALM, and other conventional offshore buoy systems. Classification of bonded marine hoses includes floating hoses, submarine hoses, and reeling hoses. The mechanics of hose motion is relative to different operations, such as twists, turns, torques, reeling, pipe-laying, etc. However, despite having multi-layers, the hose response is susceptible to high hose curvatures, kinking, and crushing loads. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the design and mechanics of bonded marine hoses for CALM buoys. The study also explores fluid transfer via these bonded flexible risers (or marine hoses). Governing mathematical formulations on bonded marine hoses attached to CALM buoy systems were presented. This paper presents a review of theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigations on hoses. Discussions were made on recent developments, structural connections, industrial operations, field applications, and dynamic responses, concluding on the merits of marine hoses.

AB  - HAZOP is the most well-known, widely used, and effective method of Process Hazard Analysis. Kletz described it as the preferred technique in the process industries for predicting what can go wrong, giving an idea of how risks can be controlled. Kletz did not develop HAZOP but had a significant role in its adoption across the process industry. It is a sign of his communication skills that he not only persuaded universities to run courses on the subject, but he was also successful at obtaining agreement from his employer to make the method widely available to others, including competitors. HAZOP is now considered to be a ‘standard’ requirement at the design stage for new and modification projects in the process industry, and is often carried out on operating systems as well. Like all methods it has its limitations and it cannot be expected to predict every conceivable risk.

AB  - The advancement of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplant has increased the chance of cure for a number of hematologic malignancies and other nonmalignant hematologic and congenital diseases. HPCs can be collected from a patient, stored, and transplanted back to the patient after chemotherapy/radiotherapy, as an autologous HPC transplant (HPCT). Infusion of HPCs from siblings or matched related donors or volunteer matched unrelated donors constitutes allogeneic HPCT. Finding an optimal donor for allogeneic HPCT by extensive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient is the most important factor influencing transplant outcomes. The traditional source of HPCs is bone marrow; however, peripheral blood stem cells, mobilized to circulation and harvested by apheresis, have become the preferred graft source because of procurement of higher dosage and convenience of collection. If a full HLA match is not available, umbilical cord blood cells can be used, either as a single graft or in combination with other cellular therapy products (CTPs). A brief overview of donor matching and selection, choice of graft source, and CTP collection procedure are discussed. Laboratory graft characterization and processing, such as HPC CD34+ selection, CTP cryopreservation, storage, thawing, infusion, and impact of those parameters on transplant success and transplant-related outcomes, are reviewed. HPC infusion reactions and posttransplant monitoring including engraftment are outlined. New investigational products reaching clinical practice, such as expanded or genetically modified stem cells, immunotherapy, and regenerative CTP, are also discussed.

AB  - ESCO is a multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations created by the European Commission to improve the supply of information on skills demand in the labour market. It is designed to assist individuals, employers, universities and training providers by giving them up to date and standardized information on skills. Rapid technological change means that ESCO needs to be updated in a timely manner. Evidence is presented here of how text-mining techniques can be applied to the analysis of data on emerging skill needs arising from Industry 4.0 to ensure that ESCO provides information which is current. The alignment between ESCO and Industry 4.0 technological trends is analysed. Using text mining techniques, information is extracted on Industry 4.0 technologies from: (i) two versions of ESCO (v1.0 - v1.1.); and (ii) from the 4.0 related scientific literature. These are then compared to identify potential data gaps in ESCO. The findings demonstrate that text mining applied on scientific literature to extract technology trends, can help policy makers to provide more up-to-date labour market intelligence.

AB  - Today’s digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.

This paper presents a Verification-as-a-Service (VaaS) framework for component certification on HPC Shelf. Certification is aimed at providing higher confidence that components of parallel computing systems of HPC Shelf behave as expected according to one or more requirements expressed in their contracts. To this end, new abstractions are introduced, starting with certifier components. They are designed to inspect other components and verify them for different types of functional, non-functional and behavioral requirements. The certification framework is naturally based on parallel computing techniques to speed up verification tasks.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Waterborne diarrheal diseases such as travelers’ diarrhea and cholera remain a threat to public health in many countries. Rapid diagnosis of an infectious disease is critical in preventing the escalation of a disease outbreak into an epidemic. Many of the diagnostic tools for infectious diseases employed today are time-consuming and require specialized laboratory settings and trained personnel. There is hence a pressing need for fit-for-purpose point-of-care diagnostic tools with emphasis in sensitivity, specificity, portability, and low cost. We report work toward thermally reversible biosensors for detection of the carbohydrate-binding domain of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB), a toxin produced by enterotoxigenic E. coli strains, which causes travelers’ diarrhea. The biosensing platform is a hybrid of two materials, combining the optical properties of porous silicon (pSi) interferometric transducers and a thermoresponsive multivalent glycopolymer, to enable recognition of LTB. Analytical performance of our biosensors allows us to detect, using a label-free format, sub-micromolar concentrations of LTB in solution as low as 0.135 μM. Furthermore, our platform shows a temperature-mediated “catch-and-release” behavior, an exciting feature with potential for selective protein capture, multiple readouts, and regeneration of the sensor over consecutive cycles of use.

Although main accent is on the available in vivo studies, certain critical physicochemical attributes will be discussed along the way for the sake of better understanding of the relationship between the drug, the nanocarrier and the resulting efficacy in vivo. The importance of supporting bioanalytical methodology is also addressed. Special focus is placed on two groups of nanocarriers: those targeting the brain, that always prove to be an additional challenge, and those intended for topical application, in which case in vivo studies need to discern dermal from transdermal drug delivery. Hence, more detailed description of the variety of in vivo methodologies conducted in the case of risperidone and aceclofenac as model drugs will be given.

AB  - Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.

AB  - Model-Based Testing (MBT) has been successfully applied to Software Product Lines (SPL). This paper provides a panorama of state-of-the-art on MBT of SPLs. We performed a systematic mapping for answering questions related with domains, approaches, solution types, variability, test case automation, artifacts, and evaluation. We built a roadmap from 44 selected studies. Main obtained results are: Software and Automotive domains are most considered; Black-box testing is widely performed; most studies have fully-automated support; variability is considered in most studies; Finite State Machines is the most used model to test SPLs; Behavioral-based and Scenario-based are the most used models; Case Studies and Experiments are used to evaluate MBT solutions and the majority is performed in industrial environments; traceability is not widely explored for MBT solutions. Furthermore, we provide a roadmap synthesizing studies based on used models, more formal artifacts, supporting tools, variability management, (semi-)automation, and traceability. The roadmap contributes to identify related primary studies based on given artifacts, variability management, tools, automation, and traceability techniques and to identify, from a given primary study, which artifacts, tools, variability management, automation and traceability techniques are related. Therefore, the roadmap serves as a guide to researchers and practitioners on how to model-based test SPLs.

AB  - Since its introduction in the late nineteen eighties, the discipline of Enterprise Architecture (EA) has evolved into a well-known practice of managing information systems in alignment with business interests. The evolution of the discipline is reflected in the many available scientific publications. Within a timeframe of three decades, we identify approximately 4000 journal articles and conference papers of which enterprise architecture is a major topic. We conduct a holistic, systematic literature review using artificial intelligence technologies such as information retrieval, text mining and supervised learning, side-by-side with manually reading of many relevant articles. For the first time, we present a holistic historical overview of the scientific development of the discipline. We describe the current focus of enterprise architecture and make suggestions for future publications and conferences using predictive analytics. As a major result of our analysis, we find that the focus of EA research has shifted from understanding EA in the early years to managing EA today. Furthermore, we identify and investigate several current EA trend topics: We find Cloud Computing to be the trend with the strongest impact on EA and predict that this will be the case until 2020. According to our forecast, the Internet of Things will be the trend with the strongest growth in its impact on EA. Moreover, based on a comparison with the Gartner Hype Cycle, we observe a discrepancy between EA trends in academic work versus practical experiences, which presents a starting point for future research.

AB  - Scrum, recognized today as the most popular agile development methodology, has been used in a wide range of settings and for varying purposes, in- and outside of the traditional software development context. The use of Scrum in non-traditional settings and for different needs led to a considerable corpus of academic literature that investigates, presents, and discusses modifications to the original method, aimed to make it fit such novel forms of application. Based on a large-scale review of extant literature, this study systematically analyses why and how Scrum was reportedly modified in different instances and contributes with a synthesis that can serve as a basis for a more systematic approach to future research and practice. We explicate nine common modification objectives for change (e.g., attaining high performance, non-standard contexts, distributed development) mapped against seven generic modification strategies (e.g., method guidance, new procedures, or artifacts). Building on our extensive literature analysis we highlight research gaps and identify promising areas for future research.

AB  - Context:
Cognitive load in software engineering refers to the mental effort users spend while reading software artifacts. The cognitive load can vary according to tasks and across developers. Researchers have measured developers’ cognitive load for different purposes, such as understanding its impact on productivity and software quality. Thus, researchers and practitioners can use cognitive load measures for solving many aspects of software engineering problems.
Problem:
However, a lack of a classification of dimensions on cognitive load measures in software engineering makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to obtain research trends to advance scientific knowledge or apply it in software projects.
Objective:
This article aims to classify different aspects of cognitive load measures in software engineering and identify challenges for further research.
Method:
We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), which started with 4,175 articles gathered from 11 search engines and then narrowed down to 63 primary studies.
Results:
Our main findings are: (1) 43% (27/63) of the primary studies focused on applying a combination of sensors; (2) 81% (51/63) of the selected works were validation studies; (3) 83% (52/63) of the primary studies analyzed cognitive load while developers performed programming tasks. Moreover, we created a classification scheme based on the answers to our research questions.
Conclusion:
despite the production of a significant amount of studies on cognitive load in software engineering, there are still many challenges to be solved in this particular field for effectively measuring the cognitive load in software engineering. Therefore, this work provided directions for future studies on cognitive load measurement in software engineering.

AB  - The safety of the coal production process, which in the coming years will continue to be one of the basic energy resources in many countries worldwide, has a significant impact on its efficiency. The random character of many hazardous phenomena accompanying this process requires the application of both modern and safe methods to study these phenomena. Model studies based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method are known to have such features. They enable the analysis of very complex and hazardous phenomena, which are hard or even impossible to investigate with the use of other methods. Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis of the state of the art in terms of the Computational Fluid Dynamics application in research on ventilation safety during underground hard coal mining. It was assumed that CFD-based studies may significantly improve the safety of the mining production process. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was carried out, which – according to the adopted methodology – involved four research questions. The review included scientific publications (articles) contained in the two most prestigious databases, i.e., the Web of Science and the Scopus. In accordance with the adopted search criteria, articles that used the Computational Fluid Dynamics method and focused on ventilation safety during underground coal mining were selected. The meta-analysis of these data made it possible to identify seven thematic areas undertaken in these publications. The following paper presents a list of articles assigned to these groups with selected items being discussed. On the basis of the conducted research, comprehensive answers to the research questions were provided. The results systematize the knowledge of CFD application in research on ventilation safety in mining. Also, they are a valuable source of information for future researchers and engineers concerned with the safety of the mining production process. Moreover, potential directions of further research in the field of possible Computational Fluid Dynamics applications were indicated to improve the safety of the process in question.

AB  - One of the underlying reasons for unsustainable and ineffective water resource management in many countries around the world has been missing knowledge about water innovations. This chapter presents three types of water management innovations: product, process, and organizational innovations, which have been successfully applied in Europe for the past decade. Product innovations refer to new products introduced to the market or in an organization. Process innovations describe new or significantly improved production processes or delivery methods, while organizational innovations are defined as changes in organizational principles, strategies, and culture of a commercial, public, or nonprofit institution. The presented innovations, if applied appropriately, could be helpful with a more efficient and effective design of water-related policies and strategies in Europe and around the globe. This applies especially to long-term policy planning at the regional and national levels, and in the areas with a high water demand resulting from a growing population and extreme weather events.

AB  - Through the decades, production planning activities have sought to balance market requirements and the optimal use of available resources in different industries. In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this study aims to disclose the purposes of production planning activities. To this end, this paper provides a literature review of the existing offer of production planning applications over the past 10 years. The authors propose a framework based on the objectives, scope and resources. The research conducted demonstrates that due to the uncertainty of the external environment, research propositions on production planning are focused on shorter planning horizons. The research also indicates that in order to face disruptions, production planning applications are mainly addressed to balance resource utilization. Ultimately, the study shows that a considerable part of innovative production planning applications have not yet been applied to real industrial cases, and moreover, they remain experimental propositions with no further use.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications vary widely including data monitoring, data collection and analysis, intelligent navigation and object tracking, surveillance and emergency response, vehicular and intelligent transport, and agricultural, marine, and photogrammetry. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based UAV-assisted IoT networks enable resource-constrained mobile or IoT devices to offload computationally demanding tasks to UAVs or edge nodes with more computing power in order to improve battery consumption, performance, or Quality of Service. UAV-assisted IoT applications generally require a lot of precision for efficient UAV control involving UAV movement and position optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been identified as one of the most prominent techniques for facilitating this and optimizing of the terrestrial network performance, thus improving the operation of these applications. This paper aims to answer twelve important research questions relating to the research on DRL for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based UAV-assisted sensor and IoT applications from 47 systematically selected articles. The questions cover a variety of topics including the UAV-assisted MEC IoT applications studied, variants of deployed DRL, the purpose of DRL, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) components, unique network architectural features, environments and integrated technologies, role of UAVs, optimization constraints, joint optimization frameworks, energy-management techniques, metrics examined, benchmark algorithms and performance results as well as identified probable future considerations based on the review. Lastly, the challenges and future directions of DRL application in UAV-assisted MEC systems are discussed. This paper aims to provide both communication generalists and optimization specialists with a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape in this field.

AB  - The importance of breakthrough innovation as a source of organizational value creation has attracted considerable interest among scholars and practitioners alike. Despite the prevalent use of the term breakthrough, we still lack an understanding of its core definition, structure, and integrative connection with other forms of technological innovation. Breakthrough is often defined and synonymously used with radical, disruptive, or discontinuous innovation. This creates misconceptions in comprehending how various innovations should be conceptualized. Using 86 research articles published between 1990 and 2022, we conducted a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis to uncover patterns and themes that evolved while defining breakthrough innovation. We also proposed a Configuration-Application-Performance (CAP) framework that evaluates types of innovations and their thematic linkages. This framework allows us to resolve some myths about how breakthrough innovation has been conceptualized and operationalized. It also helps practitioners and future researchers understand breakthroughs from an innovation performance perspective. Our nuanced review enables us to open new areas for future research opportunities.

AB  - The inherent physical and chemical properties of a compound provide the first clue of an air pollutant's hazard and risk, as well as its potential to enter the atmosphere and be transported and chemically transformed. Inherency indicates a compound's affinity for various substrates in the environment. Thus, an air pollutant will have to have some affinity for the atmosphere for at least part of its or its precursor's existence. If a substance's properties elicit movement to the atmosphere, it is more likely to be inhaled and, thus, present a respiratory hazard and risk. However, even if a substance has little affinity for the air, its inherent properties may still cause it to become an air pollutant. This chapter discusses saturation properties of solubility and vapor pressure and introduces how an air pollutant partitions, persists, degrades, and undergoes fugacity from the standpoint of chemical inherency. The phase partitioning discussions address the differences in gas-phase, particulate-phase, and heterogeneous reactions, as well as particulate matter size and morphology, including the special case of airborne fibers, especially asbestos. These discussions are revisited in the text's discussions of kinetics and equilibrium.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the critical challenges and innovative strategies concerning the H2 storage techniques involving compressed gaseous, liquid, and cryo-compressed H2. H2 storage through compression, particularly within the 350–700bar range, is an essential method for its utilization as an energy carrier. This approach employs technologies similar to traditional gas storage tanks but requires ongoing refinement to address the potential fragility of vessel components due to H2 permeation. Small to medium-scale applications often utilize gasometers or cylindrical/spherical containers, while underground storage caters to larger scale needs. Different vessel types, from Type I to Type V, offer varying pressure limitations, costs, and capacities, with types III and IV being popular for vehicle applications due to their lightweight composite construction. Recent advancements include Type V fully composite vessels, potentially lighter and more efficient than previous types. Various materials, including aluminum alloys, steel, polymers, and composites, are employed in vessel construction, with innovative layering ensuring structural integrity and safety. The underground gas storage, salt and rock caverns, emptied oil and gas reservoirs, nonoperational underground mines, and physical and geochemical reactions for H2 storage are discussed in detail. Salt caverns, with their low permeability and chemical inertness, are ideal for short- to medium-term storage. Aquifers provide high-volume seasonal storage, though challenges such as gas–liquid interface movement persist. Depleted gas reservoirs and coal mines, while requiring careful evaluation and remediation, offer existing infrastructure for H2 storage. However, concerns arise regarding physical and geochemical reactions within storage sites, potentially impacting H2 purity and reservoir integrity. Microbial activity poses further challenges, necessitating comprehensive monitoring and mitigation strategies. Following an overview of the US Department of Energy’s goals, the chapter emphasizes the need for a significant decrease in the specific energy consumption (SEC) of H2 liquefaction methods to render them feasible for future applications. Various technical approaches are explored to enhance the performance of H2 liquefaction. These include the utilization of mixed fluid refrigeration systems, such as multicomponent refrigerants, which offer improved efficiency and flexibility over pure refrigerants. In addition, liquefied natural gas regasification is proposed as a method to precool the H2 liquefaction process, leading to energy savings. Absorption and ejector cooling systems are also taken into account, offering further opportunities for energy reduction by eliminating some refrigerating plants. Moreover, the chapter discusses the potential of liquid air cold recovery, where cold energy from liquid air is recycled during H2 regasification, contributing to energy efficiency. Operational optimization techniques, including metaheuristic algorithms and pinch method–based optimization, are highlighted for reducing SEC and enhancing overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the chapter provides valuable insights into the current and future status of physical-based H2 storage methods globally. It discusses the operational sites and capacities of pressurized-based H2 storage in various locations, emphasizing the potential of salt caverns and disused wells for H2 storage in North America. Overall, the chapter underscores the importance of addressing challenges such as high SEC, low exergy yield, and substantial costs associated with H2 liquefaction through innovative technical approaches. These strategies aim to make H2 storage more economically viable and sustainable for future energy applications.

AB  - While the recent discussion on Art. 25 GDPR often considers the approach of data protection by design as an innovative idea, the notion of making data protection law more effective through requiring the data controller to implement the legal norms into the processing design is almost as old as the data protection debate. However, there is another, more recent shift in establishing the data protection by design approach through law, which is not yet understood to its fullest extent in the debate. Art. 25 GDPR requires the controller to not only implement the legal norms into the processing design but to do so in an effective manner. By explicitly declaring the effectiveness of the protection measures to be the legally required result, the legislator inevitably raises the question of which methods can be used to test and assure such efficacy. In our opinion, extending the legal compatibility assessment to the real effects of the required measures opens this approach to interdisciplinary methodologies. In this paper, we first summarise the current state of research on the methodology established in Art. 25 sect. 1 GDPR, and pinpoint some of the challenges of incorporating interdisciplinary research methodologies. On this premise, we present an empirical research methodology and first findings which offer one approach to answering the question on how to specify processing purposes effectively. Lastly, we discuss the implications of these findings for the legal interpretation of Art. 25 GDPR and related provisions, especially with respect to a more effective implementation of transparency and consent, and provide an outlook on possible next research steps.

AB  - A large number of journals and special volumes are publishing research concerned with sustainable supply chain (SSC). The importance of this the topic has significantly grown over time thus receiving increased attention from academics and practitioners in this area. This research critically analyzes the content of 286 papers published in different journals in the area over the span of fifteen years (2002–2016). The reviewed literature was structured using the following categories: year, journal, research methodology, research design, operation research (OR)/mathematical tools and techniques, data analysis technique, industry sector, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), authors, universities, country, enablers, and barriers. This enabled crucial gaps in knowledge of SSC to be identified allowing future research opportunities in the field to be determined. The major finding indicates that the research field is being dominated by the qualitative study. Also, of the quantitatively based studies that appeared in the literature, linear programming problem is the most often used solution approach to optimize the complex sustainable supply chain management problems. Drawn results show that there is enough scope to expand the research field and several opportunities still exist which needs to be investigated such as quantitative modeling, use of advance techniques and development of efficient algorithms.

AB  - Despite the enormous benefit that has accrued to society from control technology and the continued vitality of control science as a research field, there is broad consensus that the practitioners of control and the academic research community are insufficiently engaged with each other. We explore this concern with reference to the oft-cited theory/practice gap but also from an industry perspective. The core of this article is comprised of ten “messages,” intended primarily for researchers interested in the practical impact of their work, that we hope shed insight on the industry mindset. Results from surveys and other data are cited to underpin the points. Some educational synergies between industry and academia are also noted. To highlight the continuing relevance of control science to industry, several recent examples of successful, deployed advanced control solutions are presented. The authors of this article are members of the IFAC Industry Committee, formally established in 2017 with objectives that include (per the updated IFAC Constitution) “increasing industry participation in and impact from IFAC activities.”

AB  - In order to overcome the increasing demand–supply energy gap due to the rapid urbanization, labor productivity, consumerism and depletion of fossil fuel resources, there is a need for the development of technologies with renewable energy sources. Phase change materials are one of the most appropriate materials for effective utilization of thermal energy from the renewable energy resources. As evident from the literature, development of phase change materials is one of the most active research fields for thermal energy storage with higher efficiency. This review focuses on the application of various phase change materials based on their thermophysical properties. In particular, the melting point, thermal energy storage density and thermal conductivity of the organic, inorganic and eutectic phase change materials are the major selection criteria for various thermal energy storage applications with a wider operating temperature range. The strategy adopted in improving the thermal energy storage characteristics of the phase change materials through encapsulation as well as nanomaterials additives, are discussed in detail. Specifically, the future research trends in the encapsulation and nanomaterials are also highlighted.

AB  - This chapter covers three of the most exciting and demanding classes of cloud applications, Big Data, data streaming, and mobile cloud computing. Big Data and data streaming applications require low-latency, scalability, versatility, and a high degree of fault-tolerance. Achieving these qualities at scale is extremely challenging. The chapter starts with a discussion of defining attributes of Big Data and of the Mesa datastore, Spanner, and F1 databases developed at Google for storing massive amounts of data. Many cloud applications process Big Data; data analytics is an important class of such applications. Bootstrapping techniques offer a low latency alternative for responding to queries of very large datasets. Such techniques and approximate query processing are analyzed next along with applications combining mathematical modeling with simulation and measurements, the so-called dynamic, data-driven applications. Computer clouds host many classes of data streaming applications, ranging from content delivery to applications consuming a continuous stream of events. The scale of the cloud infrastructure makes it possible to add mission-critical applications demanding very high availability. Scale amplifies variability often causing heavy-tail distributions of critical performance metrics, e.g., latency. Mobile cloud computing enables the execution of mobile applications on mobile devices and computer clouds and lies at the intersection of cloud computing, wireless networks, and mobile devices. Mobile devices generate data stored on the cloud and shared with others and act as both producers and consumers of data. After an introduction to mobile computing and its applications, the chapter covers energy efficiency of mobile computing and then presents alternative mobile computing models including Cloudlets. The chapter continues with the discussion of the mobile edge clouds and Markov Decision Processes.

AB  - Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop an optimal model of an integrated quality and safety management system (QSMS).
Design/methodology/approach
Keywords related with these systems were identified from international standards and subsequently mined from a selection of peer reviewed articles that discuss and propose varying forms of integrated models for both systems. Cluster analysis was used to establish the degree to which integrated models, as described in the articles were quality dominant vs safety dominant. Word counts were utilized for establishing content and attributes for each category. An optimal integrated model was developed from the final cluster analysis and substantiated by a one-way analysis of variance. Experts from industry were consulted to validate and fine-tune the model.
Findings
It was determined that characteristics of an optimal integrated model include the keywords “risk,” “safety,” “incident,” “injury,” “hazards,” as well as “preventive action,” “corrective action,” “rework,” “repair,” and “scrap.” It also combines elements of quality function deployment as well as hazard and operability analysis meshed into a plan-do-check-act type work-flow.
Research limitations/implications
Given the vast array of clustering algorithms available, the clusters that resulted were dependent upon the algorithm deployed and may differ from clusters resulting for divergent algorithms.
Originality/value
The optimized model is a hybrid that consists of a quality management system as the superordinate strategic element with safety management system deployed as the supporting tactical element. The model was implemented as a case study, and resulted in 13 percent labor-hour saving.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms play an essential role in bioinformatics and allow exploring the vast and noisy biological data in unrivaled ways. This paper is a systematic review of the applications of machine learning in the study of HIV neutralizing antibodies. This significant and vast research domain can pave the way to novel treatments and to a vaccine. We selected the relevant papers by investigating the available literature from the Web of Science and PubMed databases in the last decade. The computational methods are applied in neutralization potency prediction, neutralization span prediction against multiple viral strains, antibody–virus binding sites detection, enhanced antibodies design, and the study of the antibody-induced immune response. These methods are viewed from multiple angles spanning data processing, model description, feature selection, evaluation, and sometimes paper comparisons. The algorithms are diverse and include supervised, unsupervised, and generative types. Both classical machine learning and modern deep learning were taken into account. The review ends with our ideas regarding future research directions and challenges.

AB  - With its advanced capabilities of immersive and interactive visualization, virtual reality (VR) has been advocated to facilitate design, engineering, construction, and management for the built environment. Substantial efforts have thus been devoted to VR-related applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry over the last decades, resulting in a vast, diverse, and fragmented body of knowledge. The objective of this research is to systematically gain an in-depth understanding of research trends as well as reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area. To achieve this objective, this research explores the state-of-the-art in VR applications for the built environment by a mixed quantitative-qualitative review method. A total of 229 journal articles are collected using a structured data acquisition approach from Scopus and then fed into a bibliometric analysis to construct science maps. By doing so, the main research outlets, articles, and themes of this research field are quantitatively identified. Subsequently, an in-depth qualitative discussion is presented to provide deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities of main research topics. Furthermore, future research directions are proposed as follows: 1) user-centered adaptive design, 2) attention-driven virtual reality information systems, 3) construction training systems incorporating human factors, 4) occupant-centered facility management, and 5) industry adoption. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by synthesizing the state of the art of VR technology for the built environment and exposing its research needs, which can serve both academia and industry in terms of promoting VR applications for the built environment.

AB  - Over the past decade, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) copolymers have emerged as a versatile class of materials, offering enhanced properties and broader application potential compared to neat PLA. As the leading biobased plastic, PLA has high strength, good processability, and industrial compostability; however, its brittleness, limited thermal stability, and slow (bio)degradation under ambient conditions hinder its widespread adoption in advanced applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of PLA-based copolymers, excluding PLA stereoisomers and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), focusing on their synthesis, structure-property relationships, and potential uses. Copolymerization strategies—including ring-opening polymerization (ROP), polycondensation, and controlled radical polymerization—enable precise control over PLA’s mechanical, thermal, and degradation characteristics. The incorporation of diverse comonomers, such as lactones, diacids, diols, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and naturally derived polymers, has led to copolymers with tuneable properties suited for packaging, textiles, biomedical applications, and sustainable materials engineering. Advances in block, random, and graft copolymer architectures further expand PLA's functionality, enabling the design of high-performance biobased materials. By summarizing recent findings, this review highlights how tailored PLA copolymers are shaping the future of sustainable polymers.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a “good AI society”. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a “good AI society.” The research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.

AB  - Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.

AB  - Herein, we report the discovery and optimization of a series of orally bioavailable acyl sulfonamide NaV1.7 inhibitors that are selective for NaV1.7 over NaV1.5 and highly efficacious in in vivo models of pain and hNaV1.7 target engagement. An analysis of the physicochemical properties of literature NaV1.7 inhibitors suggested that acyl sulfonamides with high fsp3 could overcome some of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy challenges seen with existing series. Parallel library syntheses lead to the identification of analogue 7, which exhibited moderate potency against NaV1.7 and an acceptable PK profile in rodents, but relatively poor stability in human liver microsomes. Further, design strategy then focused on the optimization of potency against hNaV1.7 and improvement of human metabolic stability, utilizing induced fit docking in our previously disclosed X-ray cocrystal of the NaV1.7 voltage sensing domain. These investigations culminated in the discovery of tool compound 33, one of the most potent and efficacious NaV1.7 inhibitors reported to date.

AB  - Context:
As the diversity and complexity of regulations affecting Software-Intensive Products and Services (SIPS) is increasing, software engineers need to address the growing regulatory scrutiny. We argue that, as with any other non-negotiable requirements, SIPS compliance should be addressed early in SIPS engineering—i.e., during requirements engineering (RE).
Objectives:
In the conditions of the expanding regulatory landscape, existing research offers scattered insights into regulatory compliance of SIPS. This study addresses the pressing need for a structured overview of the state of the art in software RE and its contribution to regulatory compliance of SIPS.
Method:
We conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview of the current state of research regarding challenges, principles, and practices for regulatory compliance of SIPS related to RE. We focused on the role of RE and its contribution to other SIPS lifecycle process areas. We retrieved 6914 studies published from 2017 (January 1) until 2023 (December 31) from four academic databases, which we filtered down to 280 relevant primary studies.
Results:
We identified and categorized the RE-related challenges in regulatory compliance of SIPS and their potential connection to six types of principles and practices addressing challenges. We found that about 13.6% of the primary studies considered the involvement of both software engineers and legal experts in developing principles and practices. About 20.7% of primary studies considered RE in connection to other process areas. Most primary studies focused on a few popular regulation fields (privacy, quality) and application domains (healthcare, software development, avionics). Our results suggest that there can be differences in terms of challenges and involvement of stakeholders across different fields of regulation.
Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the need for an in-depth investigation of stakeholders’ roles, relationships between process areas, and specific challenges for distinct regulatory fields to guide research and practice.

AB  - Software product line (SPL) scoping aids companies to define the boundaries of their resources such as products, domains, and assets, the target of reuse tasks scoping technical and organizational aspects. As scoping guides the management of the resources in SPL development, it becomes one of the core activities in this process. We can find in the literature several approaches on this topic, proposing techniques and methodologies to be applicable in different organizational scenarios. However, no work comprehensively reviews such approaches and describes the advances in state of the art in the last years. In this context, we look into identifying, analyzing, and extracting detailed characteristics from SPL scoping proposals found in the literature. These characteristics allowed us to compare these approaches, reason about their applicability, and identify existing limitations and research opportunities. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review alongside snowballing, following a well-defined protocol to retrieve, classify and extract information from the literature. We analyzed a total of 58 studies, identifying 41 different approaches in the field, highlighting their similarities and differences, and establishing a generic scoping process. Furthermore, we discuss research opportunities in the SPL scoping field.

AB  - The research on microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is rising tremendously but its commercialization is restricted by several microbiological, material, and economic constraints. Hence, a systematic assessment of the research articles published previously focusing on potential upcoming directions in this field is necessary. A detailed multi-perspective analysis of various techniques for enhancing the efficiency of MFC in terms of electric power production is presented in this paper. A brief discussion on the central aspects of different issues are preceded by an extensive analysis of the strategies that can be introduced to optimize power generation and reduce energy losses. Various applications of MFCs in a broad spectrum ranging from biomedical to underwater monitoring rather than electricity production and wastewater treatment are also presented followed by relevant possible case studies. Mathematical modeling is used to understand the concepts that cannot be understood experimentally. These methods relate electrode geometries to microbiological reactions occurring inside the MFC chamber, which explains the system's behavior and can be improved. Finally, directions for future research in the field of MFCs have been suggested. This article can be beneficial for engineers and researchers concerned about the challenges faced in the application of MFC.

AB  - Evacuation and rescue principles under life-threatening situations are clarified using a simulation model designed with a Vitae System-based agent. The Vitae System model identifies an individual's ability to maintain his or her life under life-threatening situations as characterized by three functions: survivability, vitality, and conviviality. This simulation model forms a basis for analyzing rescue strategies. As an illustration, these three functions are specifically defined to operationalize the Vitae System conceptual model employing an underground inundation case study in which people must be evacuated. Three strategies for the evacuation and rescue processes under life-threatening flooding are simulated and compared. The results show that even people at risk (evacuees) can assist one another if there are sufficient and appropriate strategies and equipment for survival. In addition to the current mitigation plan, the suggested preparations for an extreme disaster provide another type of safety net for saving human life.

AB  - Context
There is abundant literature on the application of UML Use Cases. However, the impact that these applications have had on real projects (in industry) is not well known. It is necessary to know what the impact of the Use Cases really is, so that both, researchers and professionals can make the most pertinent decisions.
Objective
To identify and classify the positive and negative impacts of using Use Cases in real-world settings.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study. The search strategies retrieved a set of 4431 papers out of which 47 were selected as primary studies. We defined four facets to classify these studies: 1) the positive impact (advantages), 2) the negative impact (disadvantages), 3) the industry's domain and 4) the type of research reported.
Results
Our study identified eight categories of advantages related to the application of Use Cases. The most mentioned were estimation, analysis and automation. These advantages had a heterogeneous distribution along the years. On the other hand, the granularity of the scenarios described in the Use Cases, the lack of a standardized format for specifying requirements, and the lack of appropriate guidelines for analysing them were the most mentioned disadvantages. We identified a variety of industry domains, grouped into seven categories. As we can expect most of the papers report experiences in the Information Technology domain, followed by financials applications. Almost half the papers applied evaluation research, including an empirical validation. Only one third of the analysed papers reported threats to validity, the most mentioned being generalizability (38%).
Conclusions
Use Cases have proven to be a useful tool in software development, particularly during the early stages. The positive effects far outweigh the few negative effects reported, although this may be due to the researchers' tendency of not reporting negative results.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) as of the level of development reached today has become a scientific reality that is subject to study in the fields of law, political science, and other social sciences besides computer and software engineering. AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control.

AB  - This chapter covers three of the most exciting and demanding classes of cloud applications: Big Data, data streaming, and mobile cloud computing. Big Data and data-streaming applications require low-latency, scalability, versatility, and a high degree of fault tolerance. Achieving these qualities at scale is extremely challenging. The defining attributes of Big Data are analyzed in Section 12.1. The next sections discuss how Big Data is stored and processed. High-capacity datastores and databases are necessary to store the very large volumes of data. Scaling data warehouses and databases poses its own challenges. The Mesa datastore and Spanner and F1 databases developed at Google are discussed in Section 12.2, while another class of Big Data applications, combining mathematical modeling with simulation and measurements, and the dynamic, data-driven applications (DDAS), are discussed in Section 12.3. Clouds host several classes of data-streaming applications, ranging from content-delivery data streaming to applications consuming a continuous stream of events. Such applications are discussed in Sections 12.4, 12.5, and 12.6. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearable devices, are ubiquitous and indispensable for living in a modern society. Mobile devices are in a symbiotic relationship with computer clouds, and their users benefit from the democratization of data processing. The user of a mobile device has access to the vast amounts of computing cycles and storage available on computer clouds. Mobile cloud computing enables the execution of mobile applications on mobile devices and on computer clouds. Mobile devices act as producers and consumers of the data stored on clouds and shared with others. Section 12.7 is an introduction to mobile computing and its applications, while Section 12.8 covers energy efficiency of mobile computing. Section 12.9 analyzes the effects of latency and presents alternative mobile computing models including cloudlets. Scale allows us to add mission-critical applications demanding very high availability, a topic discussed in Section 12.10. Scale amplifies variability often causing heavy-tail distributions of critical performance metrics as in the case of latency discussed in Section 12.11. Edge computing and Markov decision processes are analyzed in Section 12.12. Bootstrapping techniques for data analytics and approximate query processing are covered in Sections 12.13 and 12.14. Further readings and exercises and problems comprise Sections 12.15 and 12.16.
