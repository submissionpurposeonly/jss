AB  - Through the use of effectively unlimited energy from the environment, contemporary heat pump installations have proven to be a highly efficient means for satisfying both heating and cooling needs. As such, they are often regarded as a key driver in the electrification process of the thermal domain. Keeping in mind the significant share of the thermal demand in building energy requirements, this aspect in particular is projected to have a great impact on the overall energy efficiency improvement of buildings and increase of demand-side flexibility. The latter point is considered crucial for improving the precarious balance against the contemporary intermittent power supply obtained from a variety of renewable sources. However, in the process of increasing their efficiency, heat pump systems are becoming significantly more complex with combinations of various different sources of energy from the ground, air and the Sun. By extension, the complexity of managing their operation has also increased and proves to be a challenge even for experienced plant operators. In order to aid in this regard, relevant literature suggests that optimization algorithms can be considered as a viable tool. This paper explores the limited extent of existing state-of-the-art approaches for hybrid heat pump control via metaheuristic optimization and broadens the subject matter with a comparative study that analyzes and benchmarks several metaheuristic approaches found in the literature on similar problems. A real-world multisource heat pump installation in Ferrara is utilized as the basis for the study.

AB  - The increasing demand for electric vehicles necessitates advancements in mileage and energy density. Structural batteries, defined as energy storage devices that also serve as load-bearing components, offer significant advantages due to their multifunctional electrochemical storage capabilities. Unlike conventional batteries, which are solely dedicated to energy storage, structural batteries integrate energy storage directly into the vehicle’s structure, thereby reducing overall weight and enhancing efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of prior research on structural batteries, classifying both multifunctional materials and systems. We introduce several models to assess the overall benefits of these multifunctional components. Comparative analyses are conducted across dimensions such as material selection, manufacturing methods, and electrochemical and mechanical properties. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field of structural batteries and propose potential strategies and research directions for future development.

AB  - Digital twins have evolved into a mature concept, unleashing significant potential across diverse domains. The applications of digital twins are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth, with a particular emphasis on the industrial sector. While previous works have examined the frameworks and architectures of digital twins for industrial applications or explored applications within specific industrial fields, there is a gap in the review work concerning the specific characteristics of digital twins in industrial applications and the industrial processes to which this technology has been applied. To address this gap, digital twins’ overall and industrial perspectives are compared through bibliometric analysis to identify the specific development relationship, research hotspots, and knowledge structure of digital twins in industry. Building upon the bibliometric analysis results, this paper presents a complete survey on the technologies/tools supporting industrial applications. The results indicate that simulation, sensor, and cloud computing are predominant in the basic, core, and advanced technologies. Further, this work investigates various industrial processes utilizing digital twins. By combining the bibliometric analysis, it gives that additive manufacturing and machining processes get more attention from digital twins. Finally, according to Shneider’s theory, the evolution stage of digital twins in the industrial context is analyzed. It may have advanced to the late phase of Stage III, a prolific stage.

AB  - A data catalog enables an organization to maintain an inventory of its data assets by collecting and managing the relevant metadata. We conducted a systematic multi-vocal literature review on data catalogs to understand their features and usage. We systematically selected and analyzed 86 literature sources and 39 catalog tools. We first utilized the findings from the literature to develop a classification framework comprising 24 fine-grained and five high-level features, along with three maturity levels. Next, we analyzed 39 tools based on the classification framework. Organizations typically include a data catalog as a component in their big data platforms and use it to support the various phases of the metadata management lifecycle. Hence, we also mapped the catalog features to the requirements of metadata-driven big data architectures, namely data mesh, data lake, and data lakehouse. Moreover, the mappings of the features to the phases in a metadata management lifecycle were developed. Our findings shall aid organizations in making informed decisions when choosing data catalog tools and help researchers identify the critical research issues in data cataloging and metadata management.

AB  - Green H2 (GH) has emerged as a highly promising medium for the transportation of eco-friendly energy. The utilization of H2 as the primary operational medium in H2-based energy storage systems and fuel cells has facilitated the integration of these systems with various other renewable energy sources, rendering such integration highly viable. This review presents an overview of the current advancements in the field of GH production techniques using water electrolyzers powered by renewable energy sources. The present paper starts with a concise overview of several production techniques and a detailed analysis of various types of water electrolyzer. It also offers a thorough examination of H2 production methods utilizing solar, wind, and hybrid systems. An economic evaluation of GH production was analyzed by comparing the costs associated with different renewable sources. This study focuses on investigating the challenges and advantages of GH and the implementation of large-scale commercial operations. The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technologies boast higher current densities (1-2Acm−2) than alkaline water electrolyzer (AWE); the PEMWE technologies also produce a higher purity of H2 up to 99.9999 %. The wind energy-associated PEM LCOH ranges from 5.3 to 9.29 $/kg. AWE had levelized cost of H2 (LCOH) of 7.49–7.59 $/kg. Other studies show that SOE-based LCOH ranges from 6 to 9.34 $/kg and should drop to 1.9 $/kg by 2050. The cost of GH was found to be significantly influenced by the rated wind speed compared to other wind turbine parameters, and it ranged from $1.7/kg to $40.00/kg.

AB  - Implementing an industrial collaborative robot for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in the automotive manufacturing industry is an emerging technology-driven solution aiming to increase production efficiency and reduce the human operator's ergonomic load. Successful implementation of innovative technology depends on technical feasibility and on the acceptance by the affected actors. Many studies exist that focus on the technical aspects of HRC, however, research that focuses on understanding the multi-actor concerns of HRC adoption is rare. In an effort to support the successful adoption of industrial collaborative robots, this study aims to understand the concerns of the various actors who work at the operational and management levels influencing future HRC adoption in the heavy automotive manufacturing industry. A literature review was conducted to understand the HRC implementation challenges and the methods used to investigate multi-actor involvement in advance of, and during, the implementation stage. After reviewing existing studies, the actor analysis method was selected to present the actors' perceptions using the action, factor, and goal (AFG) list to understand different actors’ opinions of HRC adoption, using a Swedish heavy vehicle manufacturing company case study. The case study results showed that the actors from the same organization had different concerns but mostly positive expectations for future HRC adoption. The actors’ perception map shows the details pertaining to Actions, Concerns, and Goals as well as the logical flow between these elements in regards to HRC future adoption. The involvement of different actor groups prior to new solution implementation contributes to a holistic view of potential implementation influences and challenges in the organization. Actor analysis can provide a set of analysis processes that comply with multi-actor perceptions to understand future adoption challenges from different perspectives. In the next step, safety-related issues and under-development standardization are the key challenges of HRC implementation.

AB  - Construction of jetties has been repeatedly demonstrated to cause significant erosion in the downdrift area. Various mitigation structures and regulations have been extensively implemented, including engineering and coastal managerial approaches. However, such implementations are not always successful under different circumstances. Therefore, a systematic review of this topic is urgently needed to help us learn the status of how jetty-induced downdrift coastal erosion is currently managed globally. In this study, the authors employed the updated Preferred Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Framework for 2020 to conduct a comprehensive analysis of articles that focused on coastal management policies to address erosion resulting from jetty constructions. These articles were published between 2013 and 2023. Our PRISMA analysis reveals a noteworthy shift in the trends of mitigation strategies employed over the years. While the initial focus was on the utilization of hard structures, the contemporary approach emphasizes management strategies, such as sand-bypassing and managed retreat. Additionally, there is an emerging trend towards hybrid systems, which combine both hard structures and management strategies. Moreover, there is a scarcity of studies that specifically evaluate the effectiveness of these management strategies. Our review urges for a deeper investigation, reveals the inherent limitations and gaps in the current body of knowledge, and discusses the potential benefits associated with each mitigation approach.

AB  - Background
Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, often resulting in upper extremity dysfunction. Traditional rehabilitation methods often face challenges such as limited patient access to resources and lack of sustained motivation. Home-based virtual reality (VR) training is gaining traction as an innovative, sustainable, and interactive alternative. However, the effect of home-based VR, specifically for upper extremity recovery in patients with stroke, remains insufficiently explored.
Objective
This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence to evaluate the impact of home-based VR interventions on upper extremity function recovery in patients with stroke.
Methods
This systematic review followed the guidelines of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Ultimate databases, targeting English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to June 30, 2024. Eligible studies involved patients with stroke with upper extremity dysfunction who received home-based VR interventions. Data extraction was performed by 2 independent reviewers, and study quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was performed instead of a meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 8 RCTs with 392 participants were included. This review shows that home-based VR training positively affects upper extremity function recovery in patients with stroke, especially in motor control improvement. Customized VR systems were more effective than commercial VR systems in patients with moderate to severe disorders. Although studies generally showed positive results, differences in intervention protocols and small sample sizes limited the validity of results. The effect of VR therapy also varied based on the VR system type, intervention intensity, and the functional level of patients.
Conclusions
This systematic review shows that home-based VR training has a positive impact on upper extremity rehabilitation for patients with stroke, particularly in those with varying degrees of dysfunction. However, heterogeneity in study design and differences in outcome measures affect the reliability of the current conclusions. Future studies should include larger, standardized RCTs with long-term follow-up to assess their continued effects. Future research should explore how VR technology can be integrated into comprehensive rehabilitation programs, focusing on patient-centered approaches that incorporate sustainable, personalized technology, and support services to optimize recovery outcomes.

AB  - Patent statistics have been widely used to assess the competitive position in various technological domains, both at the level of companies and countries. In the literature, there is a gap related to studies that highlight the importance of patents as a strategic instrument in the context of industry 4.0 technologies. In this context, the present article seeks to fill this gap by presenting a conceptual and empirical framework based on a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze the relationship between patents and industry 4.0. For this purpose, 958 studies published in journals listed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases were selected. Patent analysis refers to examining various features of technological progress and innovation activities that characterize a given industrial or technological domain. This relationship points to the importance of patenting, as the literature review results showed an increase in patenting activity related to Industry 4.0. This study reinforces that patent analysis refers to the examination of various characteristics of technological progress and that innovation activities characterize a particular industrial or technological domain. This article also contributes to the patents and industry 4.0 fields by presenting the state of the art of this relationship and directing future research.

AB  - Agile approaches tend to focus solely on scoping and simplicity rather than on problem solving and discovery. This hampers the development of innovative solutions. Additionally, little has been said about how to capture and represent the real user needs. To fill this gap, some authors argue in favor of the application of “Creative thinking” for requirements elicitation within agile software development. This synergy between creativeness and agility has arisen as a new means of bringing innovation and flexibility to increasingly demanding software. The aim of the present study is therefore to employ a systematic review to investigate the state-of-the-art of those approaches that leverage creativity in requirements elicitation within Agile Software Development, as well as the benefits, limitations and strength of evidence of these approaches. The review was carried out by following the guidelines proposed by Dr. Kitchenham. The search strategy identified 1451 studies, 17 of which were eventually classified as primary studies. The selected studies contained 13 different and unique proposals. These approaches provide evidence that enhanced creativity in requirements elicitation can be successfully implemented in real software projects. We specifically observed that projects related to user interface development, such as those for mobile or web applications, are good candidates for the use of these approaches. We have also found that agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming or methodologies based on rapid modelling are preferred when introducing creativity into requirements elicitation. Despite this being a new research field, there is a mixture of techniques, tools and processes that have already been and are currently being successfully tested in industry. Finally, we have found that, although creativity is an important ingredient with which to bring about innovation, it is not always sufficient to generate new requirements because this needs to be followed by user engagement and a specific context in which proper conditions, such as flexibility, time or resources, have to be met.

AB  - The use of solar radiation for lighting purposes has gained significant attention in recent years because of its potential to provide a sustainable and renewable source of energy. One approach to harnessing solar radiation for lighting is through the use of optic fiber technology, which allows for the efficient transmission of light from a source to a desired location. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the different technologies and methods used for the transmission of solar radiation for lighting purposes using optic fibers. The first topic of our discussion was the basic principles of optic fiber technology and its applications in solar lighting to examine the different methods used for coupling solar radiation into optic fibers, such as the use of solar concentrators, mirrors, and lenses. Finally, this review introduces the challenges and prospects of using optic fiber technology for solar lighting applications and the current development status of this technology. This review concludes that optic fiber technology is a promising approach for the transmission of solar radiation for lighting purposes and has the potential to provide significant energy savings and environmental benefits. However, further research is needed to optimize the efficiency of optic fiber systems and to develop cost-effective solutions for their implementation in real-world applications.

AB  - Smart learning environments (SLEs) have been developed to create an effective learning environment gradually and sustainably by applying technology. Given the growing dependence on technology daily, SLE will inevitably be incorporated into the teaching and learning process. Without transforming technology-enhanced learning environments into SLE, they are restricted to adding sophistication and lack pedagogical benefits, leading to wasteful educational investments. SLE research has grown over time, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021, which fundamentally altered the “landscape” of technology use in education. This study aims to discover how the stages of SLE transform from time to time by applying two bibliometric analysis approaches: publication performance analysis and science mapping. The dataset was created by extracting bibliometric data from Scopus, including 427 articles, 162 publication sources (journals and proceeding), and 1080 authors from 2002 to 2022. Three kinds of SLE research subjects were identified by keyword synthesis: SLE features, technological innovation, and adaptive learning systems. Adaptive learning and personalized learning are consistently used interchangeably to demonstrate the significance of supporting the diversity of student and teacher conditions. Learning analytics, essential to employing big data technology for educational data mining, is a new theme being considered increasingly in the future to achieve adaptive and personalized learning. The 20-year SLE research milestone, broken down into five stages with various focuses on goals and served as the foundation for creating a maturity model of SLE.

KW  - Safety I and Safety II
AB  - Due to its tightly coupled structure, intractable and unpredictable workflow and complex interaction of its elements, the construction industry’s work environment (i.e., vertical, horizontal or underground construction projects) is acknowledged as a complex sociotechnical system (STS). STS theory studies the interrelationship of components within a complex system rather than inquiring about its integral components in isolation. To expand knowledge and application of the STS perspective in construction safety management, this study generates a new (STS thinking based) conceptual model through systematic review and analysis of extant literature on construction safety management. An overarching epistemological design embraced interpretivist, critical realism and inductive reasoning to analyse bibliometric data of 2,227 articles retrieved from the Scopus database. Thematic analysis of bibliometric data that was conducted through manual screening of ‘titles’, ‘abstracts’ and ‘keywords’ revealed eleven distinctive thematical clusters of research activity within the prevailing body of knowledge, viz.: ‘contractor relationship’, ‘lean management’, ‘policy and regulations’, ‘prevention through design’, ‘safety culture’, ‘safety management strategies’, ‘safety of machinery’, ‘safety of sites’, ‘safety of workers’, ‘sustainability and waste management’ and ‘technology’. From these aforementioned clusters, ‘safety of workers’, ‘safety of machinery’ and ‘safety of sites’ thematic clusters were selected for further content analysis using the NVivo qualitative data analysis tool. The results from both thematic and content analysis form the basis of a novel theoretical conceptual model (entitled ‘safety-in-cohesion’) that provides palpable insights and guidance for academics and industry practitioners to reflect upon the design, development and analysis of safety management systems based on a holistic perspective of both social and technical aspects. Specifically, the ‘safety-in-cohesion’ model: combines pertinent elements of Safety-I and Safety-II principles that apply to construction safety management. It also promotes continuous learning (through relational loop between design and construction stages) based on integration of different project stakeholders, different data types (i.e., lagging and leading indicators) and different work modes (i.e., reactive and proactive). Emergent findings and concomitant polemic discussion present an unconventional perspective on construction safety within a complex (and often bespoke) STS system on site and generate new avenues of research direction for scholars.

AB  - Hydrogen is gaining global attention as a green and clean fuel because of its production through multiple sustainable sources. The hydrogen economy consists of production, storage, delivery, and applications. Hydrogen has some associated risk hazards potential for fire and explosion such as the wide flammability range in air, high flame speed, and low minimum ignition energy. Therefore, this paper conducts a review and analysis of related challenges in hydrogen safety management. This review study discusses and then summarizes the current status of hydrogen storage technologies with the main focus on challenges in applications of metal hydrides. This review covers the technologies related to risk assessment of hydrogen storage in metal hydrides. The quantitative risk assessment is briefly discussed along with an analysis of past risk studies in hydrogen release and dispersion. As mentioned in several literature review studies, the scarcity of hydrogen-specific incident data limits the validity of risk analysis findings. With this context, the current status of hydrogen accident data is discussed, and the possible paths in data collection are proposed. Finally, some recommendations and potential areas for future research are given for developing new storage technologies and improving the safety of hydrogen storage systems.

AB  - Technology application in healthcare is a recent field devoted to sustainability in the healthcare industry. However, research in this sector has grown at a rapid pace. While this expansion has been advantageous for the discipline, it has also made it more difficult to grasp its extent. As a result, answering questions such as the most important emerging trends in technology for sustainable healthcare research, the most critical breakthrough papers, the influence of these papers, and the most productive and leading researchers have become challenging. Finally, understanding the intellectual framework of the knowledge base on Technology for Sustainable Healthcare (TSH) is also difficult. This study attempted to address these issues by presenting an overview of research work in TSH and, in doing so, attempted to answer some of the previously listed problems. The PRISMA model, along with the science mapping review process using bibliometric analysis tools such as VOSviewer and Python, was employed to analyze published works in healthcare technology indexed in the Scopus database over a span of 24 years. Although research in TSH had been progressing rapidly before the COVID-19 pandemic, the current accelerated shift in TSH research over the past four years may be attributed to the pandemic itself as well as advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. We also discuss current research themes, prolific authors, institutions, journals, and relationships among published works in TSH. Finally, we present the challenges and prospects of TSH research. The findings of our study would be helpful to researchers working in technology for sustainable healthcare.

AB  - Background
Antimicrobial Stewardship programs (ASPs) help reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by promoting responsible antibiotic use. However, implementation is often inconsistent, especially in low-resource settings. Digital health technologies (DHTs) provide scalable and flexible means to enhance ASPs, particularly through targeted educational interventions for clinicians, students, and the public.
Aim
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital educational within ASPs by enhancing knowledge and driving behavior change, with a specific focus on the educational strategies employed, their theoretical underpinnings, and their differential impact across populations and settings.
Method
This review followed PRISMA and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, with a protocol registered in PROSPERO. A comprehensive search of four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) was conducted to identify primary peer-reviewed studies published in English that quantitatively evaluated digital educational ASPs. Risk of bias was assessed using standardized appraisal tools.
Results
Twenty-three studies, conducted in diverse contexts and targeting different stakeholders, were included in the review. All interventions reported positive impacts on knowledge enhancement and behavior change. Engagement-driven approaches, such as interactive modules, real-time feedback, and case-based simulations, were most common, and strategies were tailored to the specific target groups. However, theoretical underpinnings were rarely reported, with only two studies explicitly grounded in behavior change theory. Few studies included long-term follow-up assessments, and most lacked rigorous designs such as randomization. Risk of bias was assessed and varied across studies. The interventions varied widely in duration, frequency, and delivery format, limiting comparability.
Conclusion
Digital educational ASPs show strong promise in improving knowledge and driving behavior change across a wide range of settings and stakeholder groups. Their adaptability, scalability, and user-centered design underscore their potential as valuable tools in the global effort to combat antimicrobial resistance. To maximize their long-term impact, future interventions should be informed by behavioral theory, include follow-up beyond six months, and address contextual needs in low-resource settings.

AB  - The rapid advancements in natural language processing, particularly the development of generative large language models (LLMs), have renewed interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for judicial decision-making. While these technological breakthroughs present new possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of automation bias and preserve the rule of law.

AB  - Research on membrane distillation (MD) experienced a slow growth from the 1970s through 90s but has gained revived interest recently. Despite recent developments, MD still has to overcome several hurdles to pave its path to successful commercialization. This article presents a systematic map review of all research publications available in the ScienceDirect database from 1970 to 2016 focusing on the key aspects of MD publication trends, applications, research topics and the studied membrane materials and configurations. The gathered information was compared with MD implementation trends to assess the alignment of academia and industry towards MD commercialization. A select group of MD experts, both from academia and industry, were then surveyed for their perspective on the future for MD commercialization. While desalination is the most studied MD application so far, brine concentration was unanimously identified as the most likely future application for MD. Industry experts believe topics of practical significance, such as fouling and wetting, deserve more research focus. On the contrary, improving energy efficiency in MD was the top pick by academic experts. The most researched topic, development of novel MD membranes, was at odds with the key research topics identified by the industry and research experts for MD’ growth and development.

However, research on lean in luxury fashion remains scarce, with most studies focusing on mass-market fashion. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review to examine the integration of lean management practices in luxury fashion production, particularly their contributions to sustainability and circular economy principles. The review identifies the current state of knowledge, emerging trends, and challenges in implementing lean practices in luxury fashion. Findings indicate that lean methods improve efficiency and process quality in the textile industry while promoting sustainable performance. However, the sector’s unique characteristics create barriers to adoption. The study highlights Industry 4.0 technologies as an enabler for enhancing lean’s sustainable impact. It offers valuable contributions to both scholars and practitioners by expanding knowledge on lean’s applicability in luxury fashion and demonstrating its potential to enhance competitive advantage, quality, and cost efficiency. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for tailored methodologies to implement lean effectively, fostering greater sustainability and circularity in the industry.

AB  - Background
Supporting women to initiate and continue breastfeeding is a global challenge. A range of breastfeeding interventions employing electronic technologies (e-technologies) are being developed, which offer different delivery modes and features over the internet; however, the impact of internet-based e-technologies on breastfeeding outcomes remains unclear.
Objective
This study aimed to identify the characteristics of current internet-based breastfeeding interventions employing e-technologies and investigate the effects of internet-based e-technologies on breastfeeding outcomes.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, the Association for Computing Machinery, SpringerLink, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore.
Results
This systematic review included 16 studies published between 2007 and 2018, with 4018 women in 8 countries. The characteristics of the interventions were grouped based on (1) mode of delivery (web-based, mobile phone apps, and computer kiosk), (2) purpose of the interventions (education and support), and (3) key strategies (monitoring and breastfeeding tracking, personalization, online discussion forum, web-based consultation, and breastfeeding station locators). Combining educational activities with web-based personalized support through discussion forums appeared to be the most effective way to improve breastfeeding outcomes and long-term exclusive breastfeeding rates. Monitoring and breastfeeding trackers appeared to be the least effective ways.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated a variety of internet-based e-technologies that professionals can use to promote, educate, and support breastfeeding women. Future internet-based breastfeeding interventions employing e-technologies might consider improving interaction with mothers and personalizing the content of the proposed interventions.

AB  - Energy systems optimisation models are used for analysing energy systems and questions of e.g. greenhouse gas mitigation aligned with the Paris Agreement. However, the techno-economic nature of energy system models has opened for discussions about how well societal aspects are represented. Studying justice implications in energy systems modelling is an opportunity to inform policy-makers and the broader society how long-term changes to energy systems may affect different social groups and how to minimise injustices. In this paper, we review how, and to what extent, aspects of social justice have been included in energy systems optimisation modelling as well as areas for future research. In addition to reviewing published journal articles and reports, we organise a workshop with energy system modellers and social scientists, providing qualitative information on past approaches and potential future venues. We identify 3 key findings: (i) Exploring alternative system configurations to cost-optimality is receiving increasing attention and typically done through a ‘modelling to generate alternatives’ approach, (ii) among formalised definitions of distributional justice, equality (equal distribution) is the most common equity principle. There is at the same time little reflection on the choice and impact of equity principles, potentially contributing to an overly narrow understanding of justice. (iii) Among the workshop participants, participatory approaches which involves stakeholders and lay people are considered a potential future area of research, especially for making modelling results and processes more accessible and impactful to the wider public.

AB  - Auto-cascade refrigeration systems are the most employed systems for ultra-low temperature applications, especially for small capacity systems. Recent investigations have allowed to analyze them energetically and thermodynamically, starting a research line focused on enhancing their energy performance from experimental approaches. This work focuses on the energy optimization of a real auto-cascade system working with the mixture R600a/R1150 [70/30 %], which has been evaluated using two compressor models for R404A and R290 as well as the optimization of the two capillary tubes used in the system. Results indicate that overall efficiency of the R290 compressor is up to 21 % higher than with R404A, leading to COP increments between 35 and 81 %. Optimum capillary lengths have been determined in terms of COP and energy consumption, reaching similar values, however, the inner parameters of the system change as function of these lengths, which needs to be considered in prototypes design.

AB  - In recent years, significant attention has been paid to fuzzy recommender systems for housing, highlighting their ability to effectively handle the imprecision and uncertainty inherent in the real estate market. With the objective of improving the filtering of recommendations in the real estate sector, the PRISMA 2020 methodology was applied to perform new systematic reviews using its checklist on six academic databases from 1985 to 2024. RawGraph, Orange Data Minig, Jamovi and R software were used for document classification and data visualization. After classification, 1003 articles were obtained, of which 46.36% were in Scopus, and 57.82% were articles. At the end of the type, 50 articles were identified as primary, subjecting them to six research questions. It was found that 65% of the algorithms used fuzzy logic, 60% used spatial data, and 80% evaluated performance. The main difficulties were related to the integration of various sources of information. Although incorporating reclusive methods is anticipated in future systems, the need remains to address challenging areas to improve the overall performance of fuzzy recommender systems. The reviewed articles focus on enhancing fuzzy data-based recommendation systems by proposing flexible and less intrusive techniques. The significance of incorporating contextual information and exploring hybrid approaches is emphasized, along with the evaluation in real world environments, averaging artificial intelligence.

AB  - Background
Decision-making and strategies to improve service delivery must be supported by reliable health data to generate consistent evidence on health status. The data quality management process must ensure the reliability of collected data. Consequently, various methodologies to improve the quality of services are applied in the health field. At the same time, scientific research is constantly evolving to improve data quality through better reproducibility and empowerment of researchers and offers patient groups tools for secured data sharing and privacy compliance.
Objective
Through an integrative literature review, the aim of this work was to identify and evaluate digital health technology interventions designed to support the conducting of health research based on data quality.
Methods
A search was conducted in 6 electronic scientific databases in January 2022: PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Digital Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and flowchart were used to visualize the search strategy results in the databases.
Results
After analyzing and extracting the outcomes of interest, 33 papers were included in the review. The studies covered the period of 2017-2021 and were conducted in 22 countries. Key findings revealed variability and a lack of consensus in assessing data quality domains and metrics. Data quality factors included the research environment, application time, and development steps. Strategies for improving data quality involved using business intelligence models, statistical analyses, data mining techniques, and qualitative approaches.
Conclusions
The main barriers to health data quality are technical, motivational, economical, political, legal, ethical, organizational, human resources, and methodological. The data quality process and techniques, from precollection to gathering, postcollection, and analysis, are critical for the final result of a study or the quality of processes and decision-making in a health care organization. The findings highlight the need for standardized practices and collaborative efforts to enhance data quality in health research. Finally, context guides decisions regarding data quality strategies and techniques.

AB  - The way in which urban areas metabolise resources is determined by several factors such as infrastructure, urban characteristics, energy and material flow, policies and economics, as well as links with other cities. Interconnectivity between urban areas can result in distinct types of clusters, yet Urban Metabolism (UM) literature has often overlooked this aspect.UM literature on interconnectivity between urban areas was reviewed in the Scopus database. 74 peer-reviewed papers were selected for review which focussed on interconnected urban metabolic networks. The initial analytical flow included the identification and classification of linkages and methodologies found in research. The methodologies were categorized into three types: integrated, networked, and integrated-networked. The linkages were classified into three categories: UM capacity, UM requirements, and Urban Characteristics. Reversing this analytical process, a framework was developed that allows researchers to begin with specific research questions (e.g., UM capacity, UM requirements, or urban characteristics) and systematically select the appropriate linkages and methodologies. The analysis revealed that an integrated approach, incorporating spatial analysis, is essential for understanding interconnected urban networks. This framework offers a systematic approach to planning UM studies, particularly in relation to urban spatial linkages.

AB  - Driven by a technological transition, paradigms such as Lean, Green, and Circular Economy are increasingly being addressed by manufacturers to provide increasingly complex solutions. Whether considering products or services, design plays a decisive role in this context. Concurrent engineering and approaches to Design for X (DFX) have become commonly related to products and services, revealing the prominent potential to enhance product quality, improve sustainability performance, increase consumer satisfaction, and support the design of products, processes, and systems. However, many researchers have developed several DFX techniques with modified applications for different domains. This diversity makes it hard for practitioners and researchers when considering advanced technologies, to suit the current DFX with an integrated lean, green, and circular design perspective. In this regard, this paper aims to present a literature analysis concerning a potential model for the integration of four paradigms of management: lean, green, circular economy, and Industry 4.0 while considering DFX approaches. As a result, a framework that illustrates the connection between the fourth paradigm considered and the DFX approaches is presented. Our analysis would be useful to academics and practitioners since it indicates the field's key limitations and research lines.

The purpose of this investigation is to identify, evaluate, integrate and summarize relevant and qualified papers through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of recommender systems (RSs) to suggest a scholarly publication venue for researcher's paper.
Design/methodology/approach
To identify the relevant papers published up to August 11, 2018, an SLR study on four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) was conducted. We pursued the guidelines presented by Kitchenham and Charters (2007) for performing SLRs in software engineering. The papers were analyzed based on data sources, RSs classes, techniques/methods/algorithms, datasets, evaluation methodologies and metrics, as well as future directions.
Findings
A total of 32 papers were identified. The most data sources exploited in these papers were textual (title/abstract/keywords) and co-authorship data. The RS classes in the selected papers were almost equally used. DBLP was the main dataset utilized. Cosine similarity, social network analysis (SNA) and term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF) algorithm were frequently used. In terms of evaluation methodologies, 24 papers applied only offline evaluations. Furthermore, precision, accuracy and recall metrics were the popular performance metrics. In the reviewed papers, “use more datasets” and “new algorithms” were frequently mentioned in the future work part as well as conclusions.
Originality/value
Given that a review study has not been conducted in this area, this paper can provide an insight into the current status in this area and may also contribute to future research in this field.

AB  - Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have emerged as newly regulated micropollutants, characterised by extreme recalcitrance and environmental toxicity. Constructed wetlands (CWs), as a nature-based solution, have gained widespread application in sustainable water and wastewater treatment and offer multiple environmental and societal benefits. Despite CWs potential, knowledge gaps persist in their PFAS removal capacities, associated mechanisms, and modelling of PFAS fate. This study carried out a systematic literature review, supplemented by unpublished experimental data, demonstrating the promise of CWs for PFAS removal from the influents of varying sources and characteristics. Median removal performances of 64, 46, and 0 % were observed in five free water surface (FWS), four horizontal subsurface flow (HF), and 18 vertical flow (VF) wetlands, respectively. PFAS adsorption by the substrate or plant root/rhizosphere was deemed as a key removal mechanism. Nevertheless, the available dataset resulted unsuitable for a quantitative analysis. Data-driven models, including multiple regression models and machine learning-based Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were employed to predict PFAS removal. These models showed better predictive performance compared to various mechanistic models, which include two adsorption isotherms. The results affirmed that artificial intelligence is an efficient tool for modelling the removal of emerging contaminants with limited knowledge of chemical properties. In summary, this study consolidated evidence supporting the use of CWs for mitigating new legacy PFAS contaminants. Further research, especially long-term monitoring of full-scale CWs treating real wastewater, is crucial to obtain additional data for model development and validation.

AB  - Off-site construction (OSC) is expected to boost productivity, shorten construction time, and reduce labour and material wastage. Despite these benefits, most OSC projects have not fully achieved these advantages, where a primary obstacle lies in the limited management of OSC knowledge. However, there is still no holistic understanding of the integration of KM in the OSC context. Therefore, this paper explores the latest development in KM for OSC through a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and template analysis. The review is based on 66 screened and assessed journal articles from all years to 2024 with a particular focus on KM and OSC. Through the quantitative and qualitative analysis, this study groups four main research themes including KM for OSC design, KM for OSC project management, knowledge-based OSC decision-making, and the management of OSC knowledge. The results are discussed to gain a systematic understanding of key OSC knowledge domains, investigate the integration of KM for OSC, and explore future research needs including emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

AB  - With the rapid advancements in technology and science, optimization theory and algorithms have become increasingly important. A wide range of real-world problems is classified as optimization challenges, and meta-heuristic algorithms have shown remarkable effectiveness in solving these challenges across diverse domains, such as machine learning, process control, and engineering design, showcasing their capability to address complex optimization problems. The Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm is one of the most popular meta-heuristic optimization methods inspired by the fractal growth patterns of natural materials. Since its introduction by Hamid Salimi in 2015, SFS has garnered significant attention from researchers and has been applied to diverse optimization problems across multiple disciplines. Its popularity can be attributed to several factors, including its simplicity, practical computational efficiency, ease of implementation, rapid convergence, high effectiveness, and ability to address single- and multi-objective optimization problems, often outperforming other established algorithms. This review paper offers a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the SFS algorithm, covering its standard version, modifications, hybridization, and multi-objective implementations. The paper also examines several SFS applications across diverse domains, including power and energy systems, image processing, machine learning, wireless sensor networks, environmental modeling, economics and finance, and numerous engineering challenges. Furthermore, the paper critically evaluates the SFS algorithm’s performance, benchmarking its effectiveness against recently published meta-heuristic algorithms. In conclusion, the review highlights key findings and suggests potential directions for future developments and modifications of the SFS algorithm.

AB  - This study introduces a forecasting model to help design an effective blood supply chain mechanism for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, first, the number of people recovered from COVID-19 is forecasted using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to determine potential donors for convalescent (immune) plasma (CIP) treatment of COVID-19. This is performed explicitly to show the applicability of ANNs in forecasting the daily number of patients recovered from COVID-19. Second, the ANNs-based approach is further applied to the data from Italy to confirm its robustness in other geographical contexts. Finally, to evaluate its forecasting accuracy, the proposed Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) approach is compared with other traditional models, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). Compared to the ARIMA, LSTM, and NARX, the MLP-based model is found to perform better in forecasting the number of people recovered from COVID-19. Overall, the findings suggest that the proposed model is robust and can be widely applied in other parts of the world in forecasting the patients recovered from COVID-19.

AB  - Agent-based models (ABMs) offer promise for realistically simulating human behaviours and interactions during emergency evacuations. This review aims to systematically assess the state of the art in ABM-based evacuation modelling with respect to methodologies, validation practices, and the associated challenges over the past decade. The review critically examines 134 studies from 2013 to 2023 that have applied ABMs for pedestrian evacuation simulation to synthesise current capabilities, limitations, and advancement pathways. Findings identify persistent challenges related to modeller bias, computational complexity, data scarcity for calibration and validation, and the predominance of simplistic rule-based decision-making models, while promise exists with the adoption of flexible behavioural frameworks, high-performance computing architectures, machine learning techniques for adaptive agent behaviours and surrogate modelling, and evolutionary computation methods for transparent rule generation. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among behavioural scientists, modellers, and emergency planners to enhance the realism and reliability of ABMs. By providing a critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art and proposing future research directions, this review aims to accelerate the development and application of ABMs that can meaningfully enhance the safety and resilience of communities facing emergencies.

AB  - In an increasingly digital world, many methods such as AI algorithms, simulation tools, and software are used for performance-based optimization of adaptive facades, and rapid developments are taking place in these areas. Currently, although there are many studies on these topics, they are not yet fully understood and addressed holistically. To fill this gap, this paper conducted a comprehensive review of these researches. In order to accomplish this objective, a bibliometric approach has been conducted with studies published between 2000 and 2023 to systematically analyze the literature on these topics. Using the systematic literature review, the case study location, case study building types, AF movement typologies, sustainability aspects, objectives of the studies and design parameters to achieve these objectives are investigated within the study scope. As a result, among the artificial intelligence algorithms used to optimize the performance of adaptive facades and their typologies, GAs (GA, NSGA-2, MOGA, MOEA) were found as the most widely used algorithms. Furthermore, the common software, simulation and modelling tools required in optimization process are Grasshopper, EnergyPlus and Rhino-Grasshopper, respectively. Finally, this review paper will make a general database for current and emerging AI algorithms and tools used in optimization of adaptive façade.

AB  - Worldwide, the construction industry has the potential to implement circular economy (CE) principles and transform its practices to reduce the environmental impact of production and use of materials. Thus, numerous studies analysed CE implementations in the construction industry. This work expands the current research by providing insights in the current state of the distribution of R-imperative in articles about circular construction. These represent a series of strategies for the practical implementation of CE principles over the whole lifecycle of a product and range from reuse (R0) to recover (R9). This review paper aims to comprehensively review the current CE research, with a focus on the 9R framework by using systematic literature research. The R-imperatives are employed to analyse which imperatives are emphasized in existing research and at which specific stages in the lifecycle of buildings, building elements, and materials CE measures are applied. The review considers a wide range of literature resulting in analysing 182 articles. To clarify the approaches within the construction industry that align with the 9R strategies, a categorisation system is proposed. As a result, the review highlights the primary focus of circular construction research which has been found to be predominantly on recycling, followed by rethink and reuse. Little evidence of representation of the R-imperatives refuse, reduce, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose and recover was found in the reviewed literature. However, opportunities exist to reduce material demand and carbon footprint through the integration of sufficiency and material efficiency in construction, as suggested by several studies. Consequently, further attention could be directed towards the other R-imperatives, with a particular focus on extending the lifespan of buildings and materials through reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture and repurpose. The findings state that the practical implementation of CE in construction can be facilitated by the use of standardised material passports, stakeholder integration and building information modelling.

AB  - Despite the difficulty of creating safe and effective hydrogen storage technologies, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) technology offers promise for stable and effective hydrogen storage and transportation, allowing for long-cycle hydrogen storage and safe and affordable large-scale transoceanic transportation. This research is a bibliometric and systematic review regarding research trends from the year 2000 to 2024 on LOHCs. The analysis reveals a significant increase in the output of global scientific literature on the topic, with a growth rate of 38.67 and an average citation rate of 29.69, indicating that the LOHCs have had increasing attention in terms of their possible solutions for hydrogen storage and transportation. The focus areas included hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes, important studies on the development of efficient carrier molecules (dibenzyl-toluene, N-ethylcarbazole), optimization of catalyst systems (mostly platinum and ruthenium), and confirmation of thermodynamic characterization, thermal integration, and reactor efficiencies in the area. The thematic mapping is indicative of crossovers between molecular innovation and wider system energy strategies. Life cycle analysis and techno-economic assessments showed that LOHC systems today cannot be sustained and are expensive. Future research should therefore focus on quantum chemical simulations, life cycle assessments, and their coupling to green hydrogen integration and hybrid reactor designs. The proposed activities toward CO2-neutral and bio-feedstock-compatible multifunctional LOHCs, as well as more low-cost and thermally stable options, are needed to adapt LOHC technologies for a scalable sustainable hydrogen economy.

AB  - Rapid technological progress, gradual demographic change in a globalized economy with intense competition, skill shortages and depletion of environmental resources are challenges that will reshape the German production sector over the next decade. Therefore, production workers must develop the competencies to adapt and regularly update their skills to manage changes effectively. In this context, the paradigm of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) assumes an increasingly important role, as it builds on the foundation of previous industrial revolutions while integrating elements from Lean Production and Industry 4.0. However, I5.0 distinguishes itself by emphasizing human-centricity, resilience, and sustainability. Implementing these aspects of the I5.0 paradigm involves several obstacles. Production methods must be adapted, and workers retrained so that they can continuously develop their skills to meet the demands of increasingly complex technologies. Therefore, this contribution presents a comprehensive I5.0 competence model that considers all aspects of I5.0 and its associated elements, which is tailored to the production areas of manufacturing, assembly, logistics, and maintenance.

The key objective is to assist customers in making an online purchase decision by providing personalized page ranking order of E-Commerce web links in response to E-Commerce query by analyzing the customer preferences and browsing behavior. This research work first employs an orderly and category wise literature review. The findings reveal that conventional search systems have not evolved to support big data analysis as required by modern E-Commerce environment. This work aims to develop and implement second-generation HDFS- MapReduce based innovative page ranking algorithm, i.e. Relevancy Vector (RV) algorithm. This research equips the customer with a robust metasearch tool, i.e. IMSS-AE to easily understand personalized search requirements and purchase preferences of customer. The proposed approach can well satisfy all critical parameters such as scalability, partial failure support, extensibility as expected from next-generation big data processing systems. An extensive and comprehensive experimental evaluation shows the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed RV page ranking algorithm and IMSS-AE tool over and above other popular search engines.

AB  - As an important type of architectural knowledge, documenting architectural assumptions (AAs) is critical to the success of projects. In this work, we proposed and validated an Architectural Assumption Documentation Framework (AADF), which is composed of four viewpoints (i.e., the Detail, Relationship, Tracing, and Evolution viewpoint), to document AAs in projects. One case study with two cases was conducted at two companies from different domains and countries. The main findings are: (1) AADF can be understood by architects in a short time (i.e., a half day workshop); (2) the AA Evolution view requires the least time to create, followed by the AA Detail view and the AA Relationship view; (3) AADF can help stakeholders to identify risks and understand AAs documented by other stakeholders; and (4) understanding and applying AADF is related to various factors, including factors regarding the framework per se (e.g., tutorial, examples, concepts, and terms), personal experience, resources (e.g., time), tool support, and project context (e.g., project size and number of AAs). Adjusting these factors in an appropriate way can facilitate the usage of AADF and further benefit the projects.

AB  - As a complex socio-technical system, the Control Room (CR) is central to many industries, such as process, aviation, transportation, and mining. CRs' complexity impacts the safety, operational, engineering, regulatory, and financial performance of the system. In this study, a search strategy was defined and applied to three reputable databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. The search results underwent a two-stage screening process based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were investigating the safety in the CR, full-text availability, and writing in English. The exclusion criteria were unrelated to the safety in the CR, non-English Language, and non-original studies. A total of 59 studies were included in the analysis. The included articles were systematically reviewed from the Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) and Human Factors Engineering (HFE) perspectives. Since these records covered various subjects related to human reliability and human factor aspects, a categorization step was added to the study process. In this step, all included studies were categorized based on their subjects. A total of 7 categories were identified, including reliability (17 documents), safety performance (13 documents), decision-support systems (7 documents), fire safety (2 documents), communication/teamwork (11 documents), situation awareness (4 documents), and others (5 documents). Finally, the included studies in each category were analyzed and discussed. The results of this study help identify different aspects of safety in the control room and plan to improve their safety weaknesses, which ultimately leads to an increase in the efficiency of employees and various industries.

AB  - Objectives
To examine recent literature in order to present a comprehensive overview of the current trends as regards the computational models used to represent the propagation of an infectious outbreak in a population, paying particular attention to those that represent network-based transmission.
Methods
a systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Papers published in English between 2010 and September 2021 were sought in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed and Scopus databases.
Results
Upon considering their titles and abstracts, 832 papers were obtained, of which 192 were selected for a full content-body check. Of these, 112 studies were eventually deemed suitable for quantitative and qualitative analysis. Emphasis was placed on the spatial and temporal scales studied, the use of networks or graphs, and the granularity of the data used to evaluate the models. The models principally used to represent the spreading of outbreaks have been stochastic (55.36%), while the type of networks most frequently used are relationship networks (32.14%). The most common spatial dimension used is a region (19.64%) and the most used unit of time is a day (28.57%). Synthetic data as opposed to an external source were used in 51.79% of the papers. With regard to the granularity of the data sources, aggregated data such as censuses or transportation surveys are the most common.
Conclusion
We identified a growing interest in the use of networks to represent disease transmission. We detected that research is focused on only certain combinations of the computational model, type of network (in both the expressive and the structural sense) and spatial scale, while the search for other interesting combinations has been left for the future.

AB  - In the realm of sustainable architecture and construction, facade design plays a crucial role in regulating building energy consumption by controlling factors such as daylight and thermal comfort. Traditional approaches have evolved to incorporate geometric patterns like tessellations, which offer both aesthetic and functional benefits. However, understanding the intricate relationship between tessellation patterns and energy efficiency remains a complex task. Although numerous literature reviews exist on energy-efficient building facades, only a few have specifically addressed the geometric aspects of facade design and their impact on energy performance. This study conducts a systematic review of existing literature, employing the PRISMA framework to uncover the nuanced effects and potential limitations of tessellation patterns. Of the 611 papers identified in the initial search, a large number were excluded based on selection criteria and screening, leaving a total of 36 papers for review. Among these, 22 studies specifically focused on tessellated patterns. The review identifies significant gaps in the literature: 40 % of studies concentrated on static shading screens, while only 28 % and 23 % addressed static and dynamic double-skin facades, respectively. Research on dynamic shading screens remains largely unexplored. Daylight performance was the most studied energy indicator (73 %), while thermal performance accounted for only 18 % of the focus. Additionally, 62 % of the studies focused on hot-arid and semi-arid climates. These findings highlight the need for further research on dynamic shading screens, the integration of daylight and thermal performance, diverse climate contexts, sustainable materials, smart controls, and practical designs for real-world application. The significance of this study extends beyond academia to architects, urban planners, and policymakers involved in sustainable building design and construction.

In pursuit of sustainability, the integration of electrochromic glazing with nanocoatings (ECN) offers a new approach to enhancing energy efficiency in construction. This study employs text mining analysis to qualitatively investigate these variables by analyzing bibliometric data from ECN scientific research spanning four decades. Utilizing a Scopus search query, papers related to ECN and energy efficiency up to February 2024 were collected, encompassing various article types. Microsoft Excel, Biblioshiny, and VOSviewer software facilitated bibliometric analysis. The study proposes a novel method to comprehensively identify trends in ECN research for energy efficiency. The search yielded 206 relevant articles, predominantly from the last four decades and comprising original research articles. These publications garnered 6,829 citations, with top journals boasting an average h-index of 201.2. Notably, one-third of publications were from open-access journals. Furthermore, the study identifies top publishing countries, institutes, journals, and authors, shedding light on the global ECN research landscape. Additionally, three scientific hotspots related to ECN performance in building energy use were delineated: building energy conservation, daylighting, and building thermal performance. This study marks the first comprehensive bibliometric and text-mining analysis of ECN research. Identified research gaps offer insights to foster collaboration and guide future endeavors for energy-saving initiatives through ECN utilization in building applications.

AB  - Cities are the core of social interactions and resource consumption in our current times. However, urban systems are still largely based on linear activities in which resources are discarded after usage. Current practices around waste reduce possibilities of circularity, mainly due to low percentages of sorting and recycling practices in high- and middle-income countries and landfill practices in middle- and low-income countries. This resulted in a continuous increase in urban waste and negative environmental impact over the last decades. The development of circular practices and innovations, such as additive manufacturing, is crucial to modify the current supply chain and return valuable discarded materials to urban industries. Additive manufacturing is a novel technology based on the creation of objects layer by layer involving the use of a diverse range of materials. Several materials such as plastics, metal or concrete, for example, can be transformed into functional products for cities. Based on a literature review, this paper showcases the potential of urban waste for 3D printing with a main focus on recycling practices at the end of the supply chain. This paper aims to examine the current knowledge, regulations, and practices in circularity and additive manufacturing in the urban context, to identify opportunities and practices for material recovery applications, and showcase applications for additive manufacturing at the last stage of the supply chain. Furthermore, it identifies the needs for further research that could support the implementation and diffusion of additive manufacturing in society.

AB  - California requires all new residential buildings to meet near-net zero energy building (near-NZEB) targets in its building energy efficiency standards (Title 24) starting January 2020. For the first time, rooftop solar PV is required in new homes under three stories tall. While individual technologies are available for energy efficiency and renewable energy, significant challenges exist for scaling up NZEB homes across the State of California. This study presents a novel and holistic modeling and cost-effective analysis of new single-family homes in California to inform the design of cost-effective near-NZEB homes, as well as to guide future updates of Title 24. California's NZEB homes are defined using the time dependent valuation methodology to evaluate their cost-effectiveness. A comprehensive set of energy efficiency measures, solar PV, and battery storage are considered in the modeling and analysis as well as different net-metering policies for rooftop PV compensation rates for exported power. The BEopt tool with the EnergyPlus simulation engine is used to model and optimize, based on cost, the building designs for all-electric and mixed-fuel single-family homes across all 16 California climate zones. Results show that optimal designs of near-NZEB single-family homes have lower lifecycle costs for both all-electric and mixed-fuel cases in all California climate zones than the 2020 baseline code-compliant homes. Cost-optimal designed all-electric homes are comparable in lifecycle costs to mixed-fuel homes in most climate zones in part because no natural gas infrastructure is needed. For battery storage, electricity rates with a greater degree of time-dependence will improve cost-effectiveness of near-NZEB or full NZEB homes. These findings provide technical and investment insights into the scale up of cost-effective near-NZEB home design in California. The methodology and models can be adopted for other U.S. states or international cities to inform policy making and design of near-net zero energy residential buildings.

This study, utilizing data from 34 papers (N = 35,856), has developed a meta-analytic framework comprised of 17 paths. Through this framework, we have identified immersion, achievement, and social as core gamification affordance constructs, as well as functional value, emotional value, and social value as perceived value constructs, and we have also designated user behavior as the outcome, utilizing the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework. The research results indicate that emotional value has a profound effect on behavior, with context, platform, and country moderating to the gamification mechanism. This study has significant implications for the further advancement of gamification in the digital platform.

AB  - A pillar of Industry 4.0, Simulation Optimization is a powerful tool used across several fields, enabling system evaluation under varying conditions, facilitating performance analysis, and more efficient decision-making. On the other hand, the simulations might be time-consuming, particularly when considering complex model optimization. In this sense, metamodeling has emerged as a promising technique for simulation optimization. Metamodeling aims to establish and estimate a relationship between the inputs and outputs of a simulation model, creating a simplified model used to evaluate potential solutions during the optimization process. Metamodeling approaches can be classified as metamodeling with a fixed experimental design and adaptive metamodeling. This paper presents a systematic literature review of adaptive metamodeling in simulation optimization problems. The primary contributions of this paper are the systematic collection, examination, and discussion of knowledge disseminated in this field. We aim to support upcoming research endeavors and enhance the existing literature concerning adaptive metamodeling techniques. Our scope encompassed scientific journal papers cataloged in Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Library, Taylor & Francis, and Science Direct databases. The research questions intend to aid researchers and practitioners in summarizing prevalent contexts and methods addressed in adaptive metamodeling studies within simulation optimization problems. As a result, we discuss the main metamodels algorithms, optimization and simulation methods, acquisition functions, and sampling techniques. This paper also provides guidelines for adaptive metamodeling studies by highlighting the fundamental, suggested, and optional steps to be followed in new adaptive metamodeling applications. In the conclusion, we addressed the identified gaps, opportunities, and prospective directions about the theme.

AB  - The emergence of the new space economy, driven by national space agencies' efforts to reduce costs and promote independent commercial space stations, has led to the rise of private entities such as SpaceX, RedWire, and Blue Origin. This shift, coupled with the anticipated withdrawal of government bodies and the development of smaller, cost-effective commercial space stations, is expected to lead to changes in the design, manufacturing, and logistics of space infrastructure. Currently, the characteristics of space structures are inherently limited by launch constraints, affecting mass, volume, and costs. To address these challenges, the concept of Factory in Space (FIS) has been introduced, significantly impacting space exploration by enabling direct servicing, manufacturing, and assembly of space systems in orbit, thereby circumventing launch limitations. This paper provides an overview of current research and development efforts regarding the various technologies and materials explored for FIS applications, with an emphasis on manufacturing and related technologies. The concept of a closed-loop factory reinforces the crucial role of in-situ material utilization (ISMU), and Additive Manufacturing (AM) is identified as particularly advantageous due to its speed, flexibility, and customizability, offering clear benefits over traditional manufacturing methods. Lastly, the paper identifies areas for further research to advance the potential of FIS, highlighting significant progress in in-space manufacturing.

AB  - The brain health and development implications of climate change are situated within a large and rapidly increasing body of evidence that addresses the physical and mental health impacts and implications of extreme and worsening environments. The costs to individuals and societies of negatively impacted brain development are profound – be it in the form of diagnosable developmental disability, reduced cognitive capacity, or areas of behavioral functioning. We have sought to describe the key risk domains that climate change presents with respect to healthy brain development, from the prenatal through to youth stages. Scoping review methods and an a priori search strategy were used to address the question: What are the major considerations of the peer-reviewed literature that address climate change as it relates to brain development and health from early development through to youth populations? Themes from the identified papers were charted, and findings were summarized through a consensus process. A total of 40 papers were identified in the search, spanning 2008–2022. Based on the thematic analysis, results are organized into the following nine themes: 1) heat extremes, 2) weather extremes and stress, 3) air pollution, 4) vector and waterborne illnesses, 5) malnutrition, 6) equity, 7) economic implications, 8) methods issues, and 9) responses. There is a clear consensus amongst the papers in this review suggesting that changing climate patterns and weather extremes have substantial and wide-ranging effects on developing brains. A range of responses are proposed with an emphasis upon early intervention and better data.

AB  - Agile development has successfully established itself for coping with VUCA conditions on a team level. Furthermore, in developing cyber-physical systems or mechatronic products, the collaboration of multiple teams is often necessary. This necessity to scale contrasts with the paradigm of agile development from which additional challenges arise. The study examines the current challenges in scaling agile product development, characterized by scale-related challenges and physical constraints. This paper provides an empirical investigation to address these challenges. This publication shows that product development's top challenges are synchronization, coordination, resource allocation, and dependencies between different organizational units. It is determined that the challenges in the non-scaled environment also apply to scaling; however, substantial differences in their dependencies exist. Furthermore, an attempt to explain differences in scaled agile software development using comparative analysis is given. It becomes apparent that challenges such as production setup or physical limitations are non-existent.

AB  - The diversification of chatbot technology, such as the emergence of large language models and their incorporation into various technologies, necessitates a conceptual framework for a comprehensive understanding of different chatbot types and their possibilities for educational use. However, despite the fact that chatbots with different characteristics can provide learners with different interaction experiences, previous research has drawn on a loose conceptualization of chatbots, ignoring the common or unique design features of different chatbots and the educational affordances that are provided accordingly. In response to this concern, this review aims to further our understanding of different types of speech-recognition chatbots for language learning and the affordances provided by the chatbots. Based on an analysis of 37 empirical studies on uses of chatbots ranging from those with predefined dialogue systems to those utilizing artificial intelligence technology, this review proposes a conceptual framework that comprises three key components of a chatbot system: goal-orientation, embodiment, and multimodality. Using this framework as an analytical tool, eight chatbot types are identified and defined. Additionally, a total of 12 affordances are derived from the presence and absence of each component of the framework. Analysis of the studies through the framework also offers specific insights into how future chatbot research and development should be pursued in terms of goal-orientation, embodiment, and multimodality. Finally, we discuss the potential of the framework as a relevant model for understanding chatbots in adjacent disciplines and types other than speech-recognition chatbots, including ChatGPT and other large language models.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) environment is influenced by several factors (gender, genetics, sex, disease state, food) leading to oral drug absorption variability or to low bioavailability. In this scenario, gastroretentive drug delivery systems (GRDDS) have been developed in order to solve absorption problems, to lead to a more effective local therapy or to allow sustained drug release during a longer time period than the typical oral sustained release dosage forms. Among all GRDDS, floating systems seem to provide a promising and practical approach for achieving a long intra-gastric residence time and sustained release profile. In the last years, a novel technique is being used to manufacture this kind of systems: three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. This technique provides a versatile and easy process to manufacture personalized drug delivery systems. This work presents a systematic review of the main 3D printing based designs proposed up to date to manufacture floating systems. We have also summarized the most important parameters involved in buoyancy and sustained release of the systems, in order to facilitate the scale up of this technology to industrial level. Finally, a section discussing about the influence of materials in drug release, their biocompatibility and safety considerations have been included.

AB  - Growing population increases freshwater demand for all vital activities: industrial, agricultural, and drinking; thereby, desalination capacity has grown significantly. The development of new adsorption desalination technologies has been getting much attention recently. These systems can be driven by low-grade heat sources such as solar energy, using environmentally friendly working fluids to generate potable water. The present study conducted a bibliometric analysis to identify current trends, developments, and future perspectives in adsorption desalination systems based on the publications between 2011 and 2022. The analysis covers seven major research indicators: annual publication trends, major contributing countries, scientific mapping of research sources, analysis of keywords, highly cited papers, most contributing institutions and authors, and research gaps. The paper additionally characterized the yearly publication trends, emphasized significant phrases such as water filtration, evaporation, and environmental impact. Also identified major contributing countries such as China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India, and United Kingdom. Among the notable institutions mentioned are Sohag University, Ministry of Education in China, King Abdullah University. Finally, the analysis provided an outlook on future research directions, including investigating novel membranes and adsorbents, investigating hybrid desalination systems integrated with nanomaterials, and using energy and cost analysis modeling and optimization techniques.

AB  - In response to the increasing digitalization of asylum procedures, this paper examines the legal challenges surrounding the use of automated tools in refugee status determination (RSD). Focusing on the European Union (EU) context, where interoperable databases and advanced technologies are employed to streamline asylum processes, the paper asks how EU fundamental rights can address the challenges that automation raises. Through a comprehensive analysis of EU law and several real-life cases, the paper focuses on the relationship between procedural fairness and the use of automated tools to provide evidence in RSD. The paper illustrates what standards apply to automated systems based on a legal doctrinal analysis of EU primary and secondary law and emerging case law from national courts and the CJEU. The article contends that the rights to privacy and data protection enhance procedural fairness in asylum procedures and shows how they can be leveraged for increased protection of asylum seekers and refugees. Moreover, the paper also claims that asylum authorities carry a new pivotal responsibility as the medium between the technologies, asylum seekers and their rights.

AB  - Flightcrew’s responses to alerts save lives multiple times a day. The proper design of the alert ensures correct detection, interpretation, and timely response. This paper explores the many factors of successful flightcrew alerting through the history, human factors research, regulations, and successes. By the 1970s transport aircraft had become complex, resulting in an increase in alert states (e.g., Boeing 747 with 455 alerts). Research revealed that the lack of prioritization, differentiation, and aggregation of flight deck alerts was a safety issue. The qualities of effective alerting were known: quickly orient, explain action needed, convey priority, minimize false positives/negatives, and indicate adequacy of resolution. In 1981, based on their human factors research, three large transport aircraft manufacturers compiled voluntary standards for alerting systems for the next generation of transport aircraft. Regulations and advisory materials followed for effective and standardized alerting (e.g., EASA CS 25.1322). These standards define the priority and appearance of warnings, cautions, and advisories. To comply, aircraft must have integrated alerting systems with complex logic, centralized data busses, sensors, and displays. Alerts for external hazards such as terrain, windshear, and traffic must also be integrated. These regulations continue to be harmonized across regulatory agencies. Guided by standardization, many human factors issues apply, including appropriate sensory modality, task saturation, crew coordination, and basic user-interface principles. Human factors science advises on what to alert, when to alert, where to alert, and how to alert effectively. All these factors are explained here. The relative criticality balanced with urgency leads to the priority of any alert being properly activated, given the current conditions. Even critical alerts are inhibited during high-workload moments in the flight. The flight deck systems must promote accurate flight crew response and immediate feedback when the non-normal condition no longer exists. The ability to reduce distraction by suppressing an alert is also important but must be accompanied by a salient indication that it has been suppressed. Naturally, nuisance occurrences reduce the effectiveness of alerts and must be minimized. Proper alerting requires continual improvement. Our human factors work is not complete. Flight data and incident/accident reports are an important source of alerting successes and failures. These data show us that alerts fail to be properly activated, properly responded to, and properly trained. Two areas that show promise in this area are training for response to the startle effect and to loss of control.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT), as a non-invasive measurement technique for obtaining digital sectional information, has achieved tremendous success in medical imaging and industrial fields. In process engineering, the primary concern is temporal resolution instead of spatial and density resolution, which is the key difference between process CT and traditional CT. To make this technique more suitable for dynamic and flexible measurement, quite a number of studies have been conducted, and various new tomographic techniques were put forward. In this paper, the general principle of assorted CT used in process engineering is formulated from hardware and algorithm two aspects, and state-of-the-art CT technologies are reviewed with an emphasis on key features concerned by researchers in this field. Challenges like the lack of process-orientated calibration and validation methods and data analysis algorithms for dynamic measurement are presented, together with discussions of the limitations such as high cost, safety concerns, data deluge, and other miscellaneous topics. With the breakthrough of innovative hardware and data-driven approaches like deep learning, CT will undoubtedly play an even bigger role in serving both academia and industry in process engineering.

AB  - Through a systematic literature review, we unravel current theorizing on private information disclosure (PID). We note that existing models of PID have mainly taken an individual-level perspective. In line with current understanding of privacy management, we posit that PID should be more systematically understood as a multilevel phenomenon, for two reasons. First, the disclosed information sometimes concerns multiple stakeholders beyond oneself. Second, disclosing private information can often be affected by hierarchically structured (nested) humans within social units. To this end, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework together with future recommendations, aimed at inspiring future multilevel PID research.

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art energy systems and spatially explicit modelling approaches aimed at identifying approaches suitable for planning hybrid renewable energy systems integration in rural areas of developing countries. A systematic comparative approach based on an analytical framework is proposed with defined criteria to identify potential tools, evaluate their modelling attributes and select suitable tools. Out of 27 potentially identified suitable models, 10 models that fulfilled key filtering criteria were studied in more detail. Although differences in capabilities were identified, two conventional models (HOMER, iHOGA) and three geographical information system (GIS)-based models (GeoSIM, IntiGIS, and OnSSET) show the most potential for supporting HRES integration in rural areas, despite presenting significant gaps. Conventional models especially lack detailed network analysis capacities but have the potentials to model different hybrid technologies. Alternatively, GIS-based models show more capacity to incorporate spatially sensitive data including network analyses, but show technological and capacity limitations for addressing future trends. In response, this study presents a modelling framework strategy for upgrading individual models and using them complementary. While being open source-based models and scoring well on the proposed assessment criteria, OnSSET and IntiGIS show the highest potential for use in developing countries. In addition, HOMER and iHOGA as well-established models show high scores and are notably useful if complemented with capabilities for analysing spatial parameters. The proposed methodological framework and strategy steps will provide researchers and practitioners with a solid basis for selecting and/or developing modelling tools for application and assessment.

AB  - Due to the growing concerns of emissions from the shipping industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set strategies to reduce the CO2 intensity by 40% in 2030 and cut total GHGs emissions by at least 50% by 2050, with 2008 as a baseline. Clean alternative marine fuels are widely recognized and used as a viable solution for reducing ship-related air pollution. Several studies including traditional reviews have been conducted to examine the literature on cleaner alternative marine fuels and their role in decarbonizing the shipping sector. However, these studies fail to unpack the main research actors, evolutionary nuances, and emerging research hotspots in this field. To quantitatively and qualitatively explore this research field, the current study adopts a bibliometric analysis. 583 eligible documents published from 2000 to 2020 were retrieved and merged from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases, and analyzed with the R-studio bibliometrix package (Biblioshiny). Results revealed that the field is growing significantly at a growth rate of 15.8%, with key contributions to the field originating from the USA. Liquified Natural Gas has been identified as the most researched alternative shipping fuel. However, recent trends show researchers turning their attention towards methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen fuels. By analyzing the frequently used keywords and relevant articles, it became clear that the research community has focused mainly on the potential of different alternative fuels as a replacement to conventional marine fuels to limit the emissions from the shipping sector from an environmental, technical, and economic perspective. The current study offers a basis for future research into the decarbonization of the shipping industry.

AB  - Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is currently one of the most substantially studied biofilm-based reactor due to its numerous advantageous in terms of biomass robustness and excellent pollutants removal performances. In order to understand the performance determining factors of MBBR system, it is essential to investigate its fundamental element; the microbial community of the biomass. This review discusses the influence of MBBR operational parameters on the microbiological aspect of the technology at the highest taxonomic rank (i.e., phylum, class). Moreover, a special focus on the microbial community structure of different forms of biomass in MBBR (i.e., initial inoculum, suspended biomass, attached biofilm) is addressed in the review. Proteobacteria and its corresponding class, Alpha-proteobacteria, frequently dominate the microbial community at phylum and class level respectively, regardless of the operating conditions and biomass forms. The diversity of attached biofilm is often higher than in suspended biomass, which is a strong indicator of biofilm development enhancement, thanks to the operating conditions management. Based on these findings, the current challenges and future perspectives of microbiological analysis in MBBR system are presented.

AB  - Whole-building dynamic simulation has been increasingly adopted as a tool to non-invasively investigate possible strategies to improve energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and conservation of historical buildings. Several critical assumptions are needed to cope with insufficient input data and limitations in simulation models, therefore the modelling approaches implemented by researchers are inhomogeneous and customised for each case study. A review of the literature was conducted to collect common patterns and replicable solutions, based on the case studies reported in scientific journals published between 2011 and 2022. The discussion covers all the key stages in the simulation process, from information gathering to the analysis of the target outcomes, highlighting current practices and open issues. The resulting informative panorama and technical discussion are intended to assist scholars and specialists in approaching the dynamic simulation of historical buildings as well as stimulating a debate toward standardisation and consolidation of a robust scientific community in the field.

AB  - As the demand for sophisticated language models (LMs) continues to grow, the necessity to deploy them efficiently across federated and edge environments becomes increasingly evident. This survey explores the nuanced interplay between federated and edge learning for large language models (LLMs), considering the evolving landscape of distributed computing. We investigate how federated learning paradigms can be tailored to accommodate the unique characteristics of LMs, ensuring collaborative model training while respecting privacy constraints inherent in federated environments. Additionally, we scrutinize the challenges posed by resource constraints at the edge, reporting on relevant literature and established techniques within the realm of LLMs for edge deployments, such as model pruning or model quantization. The future holds the potential for LMs to leverage the collective intelligence of distributed networks while respecting the autonomy and privacy of individual edge devices. Through this survey, the objective is to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of efficient and privacy-aware LLM training and deployment in federated and edge environments, with the aim of offering valuable insights and guidance to researchers shaping the ongoing discussion in this field.

AB  - Background
The population of older adults worldwide continues to increase, placing higher demands on primary health care and long-term care. The costs of housing older people in care facilities have economic and societal impacts that are unsustainable without innovative solutions. Many older people wish to remain independent in their homes and age in place. Assistive technology such as health-assistive smart homes with clinician monitoring could be a widely adopted alternative to aged-care facilities in the future. While studies have found that older persons have demonstrated a readiness to adopt health-assistive smart homes, little is known about clinician readiness to adopt this technology to support older adults to age as independently as possible.
Objective
The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the factors that affect clinician readiness to adopt smart home technology for remote health monitoring.
Methods
This review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic Reviews and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for reporting.
Results
Several factors affected clinicians’ perspectives on their readiness to adopt smart home technology for remote health monitoring, including challenges such as patient privacy and dignity, data security, and ethical use of “invasive” technologies. Perceived benefits included enhancing the quality of care and outcomes.
Conclusions
Clinicians, including nurses, reported both challenges and benefits of adopting smart home technology for remote health monitoring. Clear strategies and frameworks to allay fears and overcome professional concerns and misconceptions form key parts of the Readiness for Adoption Pathway proposed. The use of more rigorous scientific methods and reporting is needed to advance the state of the science.

AB  - Modelling and Simulation as a Service (MSaaS) is a promising approach to deploy and execute Modelling and Simulation (M&S) applications quickly and on-demand. An appropriate software architecture is essential to deliver quality M&S applications following the MSaaS concept to a wide range of users. This study aims to characterize the state-of-the-art MSaaS architectures by conducting a systematic review of 31 papers published from 2010 to 2018. Our findings reveal that MSaaS applications are mainly designed using layered architecture style, followed by service-oriented architecture, component-based architecture, and pluggable component-based architecture. We also found that interoperability and deployability have the greatest importance in the architecture of MSaaS applications. In addition, our study indicates that the current MSaaS architectures do not meet the critical user requirements of modern M&S applications appropriately. Based on our results, we recommend that there is a need for more effort and research to (1) design the user interfaces that enable users to build and configure simulation models with minimum effort and limited domain knowledge, (2) provide mechanisms to improve the deployability of M&S applications, and (3) gain a deep insight into how M&S applications should be architected to respond to the emerging user requirements in the military domain.

AB  - The advent of advanced computational and communication technologies, notably 6G, cloud computing and quantum computing, has transformed our daily lives and work processes. 6G network will be much faster than the current 5G network and can connect seamlessly both physical and virtual world for more computation requirements with the cloud and quantum computing. In addition, 6G also has promised to half the carbon emission for building a sustainable future. Nonetheless, these technologies are associated with substantial energy consumption, contributing to a noteworthy 5.5 % of carbon emissions. This research presents a comprehensive sustainability framework aimed at guiding the development of large-scale applications. The framework emphasizes the incorporation of energy-efficient requirements, integration of energy efficiency in the design phase, and the implementation of energy-efficient algorithms leveraging Green Function (utilizing 3rd order differential equations to analyse the energy consumption of cloud applications). The experimental findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a remarkable 99 % energy efficiency in both cloud and quantum applications.

AB  - The simplest and solar energy-based desalination method, solar still desalination, is presented in response to the expanding need for freshwater. However, as the evaporation process is essential to the functioning of solar stills, effective evaporation upgrades are required to raise the solar desalination ability. Using evacuated tube technology for water heating results in an improved evaporation process that makes solar still desalination replicable. This work conducts a review study on the coupling of this technology with the various types of solar stills. The performance of each type of solar still in conjunction with a solar heater is examined throughout the study, along with the viability of doing so economically. Furthermore, various environmental studies are offered on this kind of assembly to examine how it affects reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, the advantages of combining each form of solar still with the heaters are examined. Moreover, several evacuated tube heater designs, including tank-based, parabolic collector-based, and direct connection to the solar still, also referred to as natural mode, are demonstrated throughout the paper. Proper coupling resulted in yield, energy, and exergetic efficiencies reaching 20.95 L/m2, 65.48, and 6.67 % which were higher than those of basic solar still by 431.7, 57.82, and 74.61 %, respectively. Besides, a bibliometric analysis is conducted using the VOSviewer tool to demonstrate the contribution and trend regarding solar collector-based solar stills.

KW  - review
AB  - Background
The study of depression and anxiety using publicly available social media data is a research activity that has grown considerably over the past decade. The discussion platform Reddit has become a popular social media data source in this nascent area of study, in part because of the unique ways in which the platform is facilitative of research. To date, no work has been done to synthesize existing studies on depression and anxiety using Reddit.
Objective
The objective of this review is to understand the scope and nature of research using Reddit as a primary data source for studying depression and anxiety.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley framework. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and ACM academic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were developed using the participants, concept, and context framework outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology Group. Eligible studies featured an analytic focus on depression or anxiety and used naturalistic written expressions from Reddit users as a primary data source.
Results
A total of 54 studies were included in the review. Tables and corresponding analyses delineate the key methodological features, including a comparatively larger focus on depression versus anxiety, an even split of original and premade data sets, a widespread analytic focus on classifying the mental health states of Reddit users, and practical implications that often recommend new methods of professionally delivered monitoring and outreach for Reddit users.
Conclusions
Studies of depression and anxiety using Reddit data are currently driven by a prevailing methodology that favors a technical, solution-based orientation. Researchers interested in advancing this research area will benefit from further consideration of conceptual issues surrounding the interpretation of Reddit data with the medical model of mental health. Further efforts are also needed to locate accountability and autonomy within practice implications, suggesting new forms of engagement with Reddit users.

AB  - This bibliometric review synthesizes the trends, knowledge, and practices in climate-smart aquaculture (CSAq) research globally, underscoring its significance amidst climate change's growing threat to food security and aquaculture sustainability. Using the PRISMA 2020 protocol, 369 records from the Scopus database (2010–2024) were systematically analyzed. The research found a significant rise in CSAq publications over the years, particularly from 2013 onward, with the United States leading with 58 publications, followed closely by India (54), China and the United Kingdom (34 each). Germany had the highest total link strength (55), reflecting its extensive international collaborations in CSAq research. Although most research contributions were from developed countries, there was a notable scarcity of CSAq interventions documented in developing regions, despite being disproportionately impacted by climate change. Statistical analysis of publication trends revealed that the most active journals in CSAq research were Aquaculture, Sustainability (Switzerland), Ocean and Coastal Management, and Science of the Total Environment, with the highest output between 2020 and 2024. Annual publication frequency increased steadily, peaking at 64 publications in 2023, but a drop to 19 in 2024 was observed, attributed to the analysis being conducted before the year's end. Keyword analysis highlighted recurring themes such as “climate change,” “sustainability,” and “food security,” emphasizing the global focus on CSAq as a critical tool for building resilience in aquaculture systems. Notably, Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) emerged as a key practice, alongside polyculture and aquaponics. The study concludes that CSAq research is gaining momentum, driven by global collaborations, but calls for more focus on developing regions, where the impacts of climate change are most severe.

AB  - Smart product-service systems (Smart PSS), first coined in 2014 as a digital servitization paradigm, have experienced rapid development, especially in the past 5 years. Nevertheless, existing works still concern much on either the solution design principles or the service-dominant logic, while neglecting today’s dramatic shift towards a human-object (machine) symbiotic manner. In this context, by introducing and leveraging advanced networking (e.g., Web 3.0), digitalization (e.g., mixed reality (MR)), and intellectualization (e.g., AI generated content(AIGC)) technologies, Smart PSS has embarked on the second revolution, as the so-called Smart PSS 2.0. To better distinguish such a new paradigm, this paper begins with a systematic review of the existing Smart PSS works, covering its 3 unique solution design characteristics (i.e., value co-creation, closed-loop design, and context awareness). Comparatively, it is found that proactive interaction design, human-SCPs symbiosis, and AIGC-enabled collaborative intelligence become new design features of Smart PSS 2.0. To unlock its power, illustrative examples with underlined technologies and value propositions are given in a grand vision. Both relevant academic researchers and industrial practitioners should re-position and well prepare themselves to embrace the future of digital servitization, i.e., Smart PSS 2.0.

AB  - The digital twin (DT) is a core technology for supporting digital transformation (DX) across industrial domains that has functions of monitoring, control, simulation, visualization, and prediction. However, there exist conceptual and terminological inconsistencies in DT due to industrial heterogeneity and technological complexity. We conduct patent-based network analysis to develop a technology reference model for DT technologies in order to uncover the core enabling technologies and technological structure. Two types of network analysis, co-word and co-citation, are constructed based on the 1201 DT-related patents. The co-word network analysis identifies 13 technology clusters, and the co-citation network analysis reveals 16 technology clusters. The combined results yield 17 technology components structured into three layers: (a) enabling technology, (b) core functionality, and (c) service according to technological role. A DT technology reference model is then developed based on the structured technology components. The proposed DT technology reference model offers comprehensive insights into the landscape of DT technologies and serves as a guide for researchers and policymakers seeking to systematically understand DT technologies for the DX paradigm.

AB  - The cement industry's rapid expansion has resulted in heightened environmental and economic issues due to significant greenhouse gas emissions and energy losses. Conventional manufacturing methods, which often release waste heat, significantly increase carbon emissions. This paper proposes an innovative combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system that enables significant waste heat recovery. Through a Steam Rankine Cycle and a Li-Br absorption chiller, the system generates power, heating, and cooling, effectively repurposing thermal energy otherwise wasted. This study provides a comprehensive 4E (energy, exergy, economic, and environmental) analysis, demonstrating the system's potential to significantly improve sustainability in cement production by enhancing resource efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Our model, validated with accurate operational data and simulated through EES software, demonstrates significant improvements in energy and exergy efficiencies. Based on the input data and operational results, the proposed system recovers 3078 kW of helpful energy, including 945 kW of cooling and 2133 kW of heating. The system's energy and exergy efficiency are 30.2 % and 28.69 %, respectively, and with an initial investment of $661,803, the payback period is 6.183 years. Additionally, the sustainability index is 0.1216, and the exergoenvironmental index is 0.6928, reflecting the ecological and economic viability of the system.

AB  - Organisations increasingly rely on data-driven strategies, utilising analytics to achieve competitive advantages. This paper systematically investigates the integration of big data into Building Information Modeling (BIM) within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sectors, named “big BIM data.” Employing mixed methods of systematic and bibliometric analysis, it synthesises findings from 125 records published 2013–23. While many studies are at preliminary stages with conceptual or small-scale experimental approaches, the paper categorises its results into four domains: AEC organisational infrastructure, big BIM data (IT) infrastructure, AEC organisational strategic domain, and big BIM data (IT) strategic domain, aligned with the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM), exploring organisational competencies, governance factors, and strategic frameworks. This paper introduces the AEC Organisational - Big BIM Data SAM as the research agenda to implement big BIM data utilisation across AEC industry. This framework thoroughly addresses organisational dynamics while emphasising interconnectedness among individual projects, organisational tiers, and industry-wide standards.

AB  - Context:
Developer experience (DX) plays a key role in developers’ performance and their continued involvement in a software ecosystem (SECO) platform. While researchers and practitioners have recognized several factors affecting DX in SECO platforms, a clear roadmap of the most influential factors is still missing. This is particularly important given the direct impact on developers’ interest in SECO and their ongoing engagement with the common technological platform.
Goal:
This work aims to identify key DX factors and understand how they influence third-party developers’ decisions to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO.
Methods:
We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS), analyzing 29 studies to assess the state-of-the-art of DX in SECO. Additionally, we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the influence of 27 DX factors (identified in our SMS) from the perspective of 21 third-party developers to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO.
Results:
The factors that most strongly influence developers’ adoption and ongoing contributions to a SECO are: “financial costs for using the platform”, “desired technical resources for development”, “low barriers to entry into the applications market”, and “more financial gains”.
Conclusion:
DX is essential for the success and sustainability of SECO. Our set of DX factors provides valuable insights and recommendations for researchers and practitioners to address key DX concerns from the perspective of third-party developers.

AB  - Well-functioning governance arrangements are an essential, but often overlooked or poorly understood contributor to high quality health systems. Yet governance systems are embedded in institutional structures and shaped by cultural norms that can be difficult to change. We look at a country that has implemented two major health system reforms separated by half a century during which it has undergone remarkable political, economic, and social change. These are the Chinese Patriotic Health Campaign (PHC), beginning in the 1950s, and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), in the 2000s. We use these as case studies to explore how governance arrangements supported the design and implementation of policies implemented on a large scale in these quite different contexts. Drawing on review of archival documents, published literature, and semi-structured interviews with key policy makers, we conclude that few aspects of governance underwent fundamental changes. In both periods, the policy design stage included encouragement of sub-national tiers of government to pilot policy options, accumulate evidence, and disseminate it to others facing similar challenges, all facilitated by clear lines of accountability and a willingness by those at the top of the hierarchy to learn lessons from lower levels. At the implementation stage, rapid scaling up benefitted from leadership by national institutions that could enact regulations and set policy goals and targets for lower tiers of government, evaluating the performance of local government officers in terms of their ability to implement policy, while encouraging local government to pilot innovative measures. These findings highlight the importance of a detailed understanding of governance and how it is shaped by context, demonstrating continuity over long periods even at times of major social, political, and economic change. This understanding can inform future policy development in China and measures to strengthen governance aspects of reforms elsewhere.

AB  - Purpose
Retail omnichannel implementation faces barriers hindering accurate and efficient integration across marketing channels. Our desk examination identified a need for a broader perspective in investigating these barriers, moving away from a dominant, narrow approach. This research aims to develop a comprehensive set of items to measure retail omnichannel obstacles, refine the scale and assess its reliability and validity for a robust measurement tool.
Design/methodology/approach
Our approach combines quantitative and qualitative methods, using data from primary and secondary sources to create and validate the omnichannel obstacles scale.
Findings
This study emphasises the inclusive nature of retail functional areas, departing from prior literature that examined them in isolation. Instead of focussing on separate domains where retail omnichannel obstacles may arise, we adopt a holistic perspective by integrating previously disconnected elements.
Originality/value
We assert that challenges in retail omnichannel operations encompass three distinct dimensions: operational efficiency, channel inefficiency, and strategy and organisational culture within retailing. In our final validated measurement model, we consolidate the channel inefficiency dimension and refine the omnichannel obstacles scale to emphasise two areas of consideration.

AB  - The integration of smart systems in industrial logistics can be seen as a major opportunity to strengthen the productivity and international competitiveness of macro- and micro-economic entities within the European Union and on a global scale, as well. Thereby, a smart system can be understood as a system that uses a combination of human-based processes supported by real-time data from actors and sensors by applying an embedded approach. After reflecting on the term smart system, this paper discusses the potential of smart systems integration by focusing on the research area of industrial logistics in manufacturing enterprises. Moreover, the authors present a framework for the usage of smart logistics in manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, based on a literature review and multiple case studies, the authors outline a set of exemplary research initiatives in the field of smart systems integration and discuss preliminary research findings. Finally, future perspectives for both research and practical applications are presented.

AB  - The role of the oil and gas industry in society is irrefutably vital as it is the main driver of the global energy system which significantly contributes to economic and social development. However, with the growing international concerns especially on climate change and environmental degradation, O&G production should enhance its positive impacts and mitigate its negative effects through sustainable development. This paper aimed to systematically plot the scientific research outputs on sustainable oil and gas production by using a quantitative review technique called bibliometric analysis. The data was retrieved from the Scopus database and was analyzed using the VOSviewer software. Out of 3,493, only 232 keywords from the 312 articles met the threshold and were analyzed. The results showed that the topics related to the [natural] gas industry gained considerable attention from researchers from 1994 to 2021, featured in 163 articles with 1718 total link strength. Moreover, one of the recently most citable research topics was related to enhanced recovery of heavy crude oil with 130 total citations from 2019 to 2021. Overall, this study could be used by researchers to quantitively examine the trends and future direction of this research topic.

AB  - In academia and political debates, the notions of ‘degrowth’ has gained traction since the dawn of the 21st century. While some uncertainty around its exact definition remains, research on degrowth revolves around the idea of reducing resource and energy throughput as a unifying theme. We employ a mixed-methods design to systematically review the scientific peer-reviewed English literature from 2008 to 2022 that refers to ‘degrowth’ or ‘post-growth’ in title, keywords or abstract (N = 951). We find a lack of concrete distributional and monetary policy proposals in the sample analyzed, and a low overall degree of collaboration among authors in relation to degrowth's age and size. The scientific peer-reviewed literature analyzed can be grouped into seven clusters along two major gradients, one along methodology (qualitative-quantitative) and the other along scale-of-analysis (individual-societal). We conclude that the academic literature about degrowth would benefit from a more prominent discussion of the political implications of its ideas and proposals, and that in particular the debate about distributional policy implications of degrowth should be more prominent and concrete, with a stronger focus on distributional policies in a degrowing economy.

Recently, regenerative medicine has exhibited vast potential in age-related MSK, with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their derived exosomes (Exos) therapies showing distinct advantages. However, these therapies face several limitations, including issues related to ensuring stability and effective distribution within the body. Hydrogels, acting as an ideal carrier, can enhance the therapeutic effects and application range of MSCs and Exos derived from MSCs (MSC-Exos). Therefore, this review comprehensively summarizes the application progress of MSCs and MSC-Exos combined with hydrogels in age-related MSK disease research. It aims to provide a detailed perspective, showcasing the functional enhancement of MSCs and MSC-Exos when incorporated into hydrogels. Additionally, this review explores their potential and challenges in treating age-related MSK diseases, offering references for future research directions and potential innovative strategies.

AB  - The rising prominence of blockchain technology has spurred researchers to delve deeper into its applications through the lens of organizational and management theories. Our thematic analysis of blockchain literature reveals examination across five key areas: economic, strategic, operational, behavioral, and implementation considerations, each viewed through various theoretical perspectives. The multifaceted nature of blockchain phenomena necessitates diverse types of theory and research questions. Thus, the unique characteristics within each area stimulate the formulation of inquiries that address a system of research questions about what, how, why, when, where, what will be, and how to do. Existing literature predominantly emphasizes explanatory and predictive type of theories, notably expanding research topics such as blockchain adoption behavior. However, this singular focus limits the exploration of diverse reasoning approaches suited to blockchain's complexity. Our study illustrates how different types of theory contribute to understanding each of the identified blockchain application areas. Based on our findings, we propose pertinent questions that highlight the need for varied theoretical frameworks and address specific issues within each application area. Furthermore, we recommend appropriate type of theories to address these questions, fostering a more multi-perspective investigation across the breadth of blockchain-related research topics and areas. By embracing diverse theoretical perspectives, we aim to create a more balanced research landscape, facilitating deeper insights into blockchain phenomena.

In order to meet these challenges, digitalization can be leveraged to achieve a transformation in product and service development. As a result, new concepts and methods are emerging, including smart product-service systems (smart PSSs). In combination with smart, connected products (SCPs), added value can be generated for several contracting parties. There are various methodologies available for the development and usage of smart services. However, these are insufficiently applied in practice. Here, an overview of methodologies supporting the various phases of the lifecycle of smart PSSs is presented. In doing so, a classification of these approaches is derived and discussed, while the need for further methodological research is outlined.

AB  - Predictive control offers significant advantages in nonlinear control, high thermal inertia, and dynamic control. This article uses a Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology to review 245 studies on predictive control in HVAC systems over the past 12 years, focusing on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Model-Free Predictive Control (MFPC). In cooling systems, MPC is widely applied to energy efficiency management, continuous operation and maintenance, and overall system optimization in multi-zone residences. Its advantage is its ability to respond to system dynamics and precisely control key components such as cooling towers, condensers, evaporators, and pumps. Research focuses on simplifying models, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing real-time performance. In contrast, MFPC saves energy in equipment components and overall operation through intelligent valves, agent control programs, and other methods. Research focuses on developing new reinforcement learning algorithms to improve control efficiency and reliability. MPC research in heating systems focuses on hydraulic and thermal balance in central heating systems and expands to managing renewable energy hybrid systems. The research aims to dynamically adjust to meet user thermal comfort requirements while reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency. Key technologies include modeling techniques, distributed MPC, cross-regional integrated control, and efficient renewable energy integration strategies. MFPC precisely controls heating system water supply temperature, heat pump energy efficiency, and heating terminals through model-free algorithms like deep reinforcement learning and multivariable extremum seeking control. In integrated HVAC systems, MPC research focuses on managing multi-energy systems through hierarchical decomposition and multi-layer strategies, seamless renewable energy integration and optimization, and developing multi-objective optimization and decision support tools. MFPC research includes automatic grading strategies for integrated controllers, online optimization balancing methods, multi-agent methods, and developing intelligent model-free adaptive control strategies. However, MFPC integration in practical applications still needs strengthening. This review guides researchers in selecting the best predictive control mode for various HVAC system applications.

AB  - Access to clean water and adequate wastewater services is a fundamental human right, yet many Indigenous communities in Canada continue to face significant challenges in this area. Despite governmental commitments and ongoing efforts, numerous communities remain under longstanding drinking water advisories, and inadequate wastewater management persists, creating a public health and environmental crisis. This review examines the complex interconnections between decentralized water and wastewater systems in Indigenous communities, with a primary focus on rural Alberta. It highlights the critical gaps in available data, the lack of holistic approaches to understanding these systems, and the barriers created by current regulatory frameworks and funding policies. The analysis reveals how decentralized systems, such as cisterns and septic tanks, often fail due to inadequate infrastructure, insufficient funding, and regulatory ambiguities. Particular attention is given to the pervasive issue of "shoot-outs"—untreated wastewater discharges that disproportionately impact First Nations communities. The paper argues for a re-evaluation of current policies and funding models to better address the unique needs of Indigenous communities, proposing a framework that integrates technical, social, and political considerations. This review calls for an urgent response to reconcile disparities, enhance collaborative governance, and ensure equitable access to safe water and wastewater services for all Indigenous peoples in Canada.
