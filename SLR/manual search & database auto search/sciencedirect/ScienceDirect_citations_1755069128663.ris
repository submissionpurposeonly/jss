AB  - The boarding process is on the critical path of the turn-around. Reduction in boarding time can benefit airline carriers and airports and improve passenger satisfaction. However, aisle interference caused by passengers placing their luggage during boarding is a key factor leading to cabin congestion and low boarding efficiency. Therefore, the storage time for the carry-on luggage and its influencing factors is analyzed in this study. An experiment was conducted in a B737-800 model (1/3 size) to explore the factors effecting the time of luggage storage, and a new effective model of luggage storage time is proposed through a significance test and data fitting. The results show that the age of passengers, the type and quantity of luggage, and the existing luggage in the luggage bin have a significant impact on the luggage storage time; the rule of the variation in luggage placing time is similar between young adult passengers and middle aged passengers; the impact of the existing luggage in the overhead bin on the luggage storage time shows a stable trend in the initial period, but with the quantity of the luggage increasing to a certain point, the luggage storage time begins to increase sharply, which is known as a “jump”; and the luggage type has a great influence on the threshold value of jump. The results of the study can provide a reference for airlines to manage cabin luggage to improve boarding efficiency and improve passenger experience.

AB  - Chronic alcohol consumption and alcohol abuse disorder are highly linked to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction exclusively in the liver and the brain. There is an overlapping genetic risk factors between alcohol-use and neurodegenerative disorders, with particular emphasis on the role of inherent immunity in the pathophysiological mechanisms of both areas. Β-OH butyrate can be used as an effective protective therapeutic agent for treatment of AD. ALDH2 dysfunction and decreased activity is proven to be a risk factor for AD accelerating AD pathogenesis. Complicated genetic and environmental factors are most likely determining the pathophysiological consequences of alcohol drinking and its effect on dementia. On the genetic level, there is a strong association between shortening the telomere length and heavy drinking or AUD. Furthermore, at the early stages of development and childhood phases can largely be influenced by environmental factors and can increase the risk of neurodegeneration in adulthood. Therefore, epigenetic modifications must be considered when assessing gene–environment interactions in AD. Alcohol affects various aspects of neuroimmune signaling and synaptic function distinctly in males and females. The amount of alcohol consumption showed significant sex-specific effects on AD. Numerous investigations concluded that there is a clear US ethnic-group differences in alcohol-attributed social and health-related harms.

AB  - Introduction: The construction industry employs about 7% of global manpower and contributes about 6% to the global economy. However, statistics have depicted that the construction industry contributes significantly to workplace fatalities and injuries despite multiple interventions (including technological applications) implemented by governments and construction companies. Recently, immersive technologies as part of a suite of industry 4.0 technologies, have also strongly emerged as a viable pathway to help address poor construction occupational safety and health (OSH) performance. Method: With the aim of gaining a broad view of different construction OSH issues addressed using immersive technologies, a review on the application of immersive technologies for construction OSH management is conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach and bibliometric analysis of literature. This resulted in the evaluation of 117 relevant papers collected from three online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and Engineering Village). Results: The review revealed that literature have focused on the application of various immersive technologies for hazard identification and visualization, safety training, design for safety, risk perception, and assessment in various construction works. The review identified several limitations regarding the use of immersive technologies, which include the low level of adoption of the developed immersive technologies for OSH management by the construction industry, very limited research on the application of immersive technologies for health hazards, and limited focus on the comparison of the effectiveness of various immersive technologies for construction OSH management. Conclusions and Practical Applications: For future research, it is recommended to identify possible reasons for the low transition level from research to industry practice and proffer solutions to the identified issues. Another recommendation is the study of the effectiveness of the use of immersive technologies for addressing health hazards in comparison to the conventional methods.

To evaluate the prevalence and morphological characteristics of DI using CBCT.
Methods
A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials, cross-sectional studies, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies evaluating the morphological characteristics of DI in anterior teeth using CBCT. Three reviewer authors independently screened the studies, applied the eligibility criteria, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted until September (2022). The risk of bias was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Meta-analyses of proportions were used for estimate the prevalence DI according to factors at participant and tooth levels.
Results
Six studies were included in the meta-analysis. Among 7373 individuals, a prevalence of 7.45 % of DI was observed (n = 258; τ2 = 0.0096; CI of 4.51–11.3; p < 0.05), with no significant influence of sex. Regarding laterality, unilateral DI showed higher mean prevalence (4.30 %; CI of 2.03–7.33). Among the 382 anterior teeth with DI (0.72 %), the most affected tooth was the upper lateral incisor (5.12 %; n = 329; CI of 2.35–8.86; p < 0.001), type I was the most prevalent (0.59 %; CI of 0.24–1.08) and the presence of open apex and periradicular pathology ranged from 4.3 % to 22.72 % and 3.5–77.92 %, respectively.
Conclusions
The prevalence of individuals with dens invaginatus was 7.45 %, the most affect tooth was the upper lateral incisor with a prevalence of 5.12 % unilaterally and type I was the most prevalent morphology.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of local religiosity on employee treatment, proxied by workplace safety incidents. Using the establishment-level data compiling on the incidents of work-related injuries, we find that employees of the establishments in more religious counties get less injured than those in less religious counties. We further find that a reduction in occupational accidents is more evident for establishments in counties dominated by one religious denomination, strengthening our argument on community solidarity and homophily stemming from religious networks. Firms whose establishments are located in high religiosity counties are less likely to violate workplace conduct and more likely to take workplace safety measures. Moreover, firms with more work-related injuries exhibit poorer firm performance. Overall, our findings suggest that local religiosity has a value implication through human capital protection.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring both opportunities and challenges to human resource management (HRM). While scholars have been examining the impact of AI on workplace outcomes more closely over the past two decades, the literature falls short in providing a holistic scholarly review of this body of research. Such a review is needed in order to: (a) guide future research on the effects of AI on the workplace; and (b) help managers make proper use of AI technology to improve workplace and organizational outcomes. This is the first systematic review to explore the relationship between artificial intelligence and workplace outcomes. Through an exhaustive systematic review and analysis of existing literature, we ultimately examine and cross-relate 60 papers, published in 30 leading international (AJG 3 and 4) journals over a period of 25 years (1995–2020). Our review researches the AI-workplace outcomes nexus by drawing on the major functions of human resource management and the process framework of ‘antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes’ at multiple levels of analysis. We review the sampled articles based on years of publication, theories, methods, and key themes across the ‘antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes’ framework. We provide useful directions for future research by embedding our discussion within HR literature, while we recommend topics drawing on alternative units of analysis and theories that draw on the individual, team, and institutional levels.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance
Historical texts on materia medica can be an attractive source of ethnopharmacological information. Various research groups have investigated corresponding resources from Europe and the Mediterranean region, pursuing different objectives. Regardless of the method used, the indexing of textual information and its conversion into data sets useful for further investigations represents a significant challenge.
Aim of the study
First, this study aims to systematically catalogue pharmaco-botanical information in the Receptarium of Burkhard von Hallwyl (RBH) in order to identify candidate plants in a targeted manner. Secondly, the potential of RBH as a resource for pharmacological investigations will be assessed by means of a preliminary in vitro screening.
Materials and methods
We developed a relational database for the systematic recording of parameters composing the medical recipes contained in the historical text. Focusing on dermatological recipes, we explored the mentioned plants and their uses by drawing on specific literature. The botanical identities (candidate species) suggested in the literature for the historical plant names were rated based on their plausibility of being the correct attribution. The historical uses were interpreted by consulting medical-historical and modern clinical literature. For the subsequent in vitro screening, we selected candidate species used in recipes directed at the treatment of inflammatory or infectious skin disorders and wounds. Plants were collected in Switzerland and their hydroethanolic crude extracts tested for possible cytotoxic effects and for their potential to modulate the release of IL-6 and TNF in PS-stimulated whole blood and PBMCs.
Results
The historical text analysis points up the challenges associated with the assessment of historical plant names. Often two or more plant species are available as candidates for each of the 161 historical plant names counted in the 200 dermatological recipes in RBH. On the other hand, our method enabled to draw conclusions about the diseases underlying the 56 medical applications mentioned in the text. On this basis, 11 candidate species were selected for in vitro screening, four of which were used in RBH in herbal simple recipes and seven in a herbal compound formulation. None of the extracts tested showed a noteworthy effect on cell viability except for the sample of Sanicula europaea L. Extracts were tested at 50 μg/mL in the whole blood assay, where especially Vincetoxicum hirundinaria Medik. or Solanum nigrum L. showed inhibitory or stimulatory activities. In the PBMC assay, the root of Vincetoxicum hirundinaria revealed a distinct inhibitory effect on IL-6 release (IC50 of 3.6 μg/mL).
Conclusions
Using the example of RBH, this study illustrates a possible ethnopharmacological path from unlocking the historical text and its subsequent analysis, through the selection and collection of plant candidates to their in vitro investigation. Fully documenting our approach to the analysis of historical texts, we hope to contribute to the discussion on solutions for the digital indexing of premodern information on the use of plants or other natural products.

AB  - Telemedicine has become fundamental for the challenges posed to healthcare. This set of instruments turns pivotal for facing one of the most relevant emergencies in human history: the COVID-19 pandemic. The multisectoral crisis led to a vigorously sustained adoption of innovations, including telemedicine technology. Telehealth was proven, in this context, to be a relevant tool to reduce healthcare costs, reduce not-needed hospitalizations, and improve the results in health care. Some barriers such as the costs of technologies, patient privacy and technical literacy have slowed down telemedicine adoption. Amidst the COVID-19 era, telemedicine calls for a managerial duty to change healthcare's organizational models. The present work aims to explore the growing literature to illuminate the relationships between telemedicine, innovations and healthcare in the COVID-19 framework. A bibliometric analysis of the existing literature based on 285 published works in 2019–2020 is put forward with the aim to detect the relevant literature, themes and approaches on telemedicine and COVID-19. Making use of community detection on the co-occurrence keywords network, we identify the “semantic cores” in the literature representing the relevant results on critical themes. The sorting implications are important for researchers and policymakers by mapping the existing literature and results in evidence-based analysis. We provide the key communities as the “semantic core” of the publications and results for the considered period. This allows for future research to be oriented towards perduring health policies that could lead to the adoption of telemedicine technologies in a post-pandemic scenario.

AB  - With the trend of global warming and destructive human activities, the frequent occurrences of catastrophes have posed devastating threats to human life and social stability worldwide. The emergency management (EM) system plays a significant role in saving people's lives and reducing property damage. The prediction system for the occurrence of emergency events and resulting impacts is widely recognized as the first stage of the EM system, the accuracy of which has a significant impact on the efficiency of resource allocation, dispatching, and evacuation. In fact, the number and variety of contributions to prediction techniques, such as statistic analysis, artificial intelligence, and simulation method, are exploded in recent years, motivating the need for a systematic analysis of the current works on disaster prediction. To this end, this paper presents a systematic review of contributions on prediction methods for emergency occurrence and resource demand of both natural and man-made disasters. Through a detailed discussion on the features of each type of emergency event, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art prediction technologies which have been widely applied in EM. After that, we summarize the challenges of current efforts and point out future directions.

AB  - Public urban green spaces provide people with many benefits. Understanding the relationship between public urban green spaces’ characteristics and human well-being components may assist in future planning and design of these spaces. This study performed a systematic bibliographic review to analyse the relationships between green spaces' specific characteristics and human well-being components. The green spaces characteristics found in 153 articles were divided in four groups: structure, biodiversity, naturalness, and others; while dimensions of human well-being were divided into four groups: health, security, good social relations, and freedom of choice and action. The number of green spaces and their percentage of vegetation cover and size (structure category) improved human well-being, in all aspects, especially in health. Structure and biodiversity are the characteristics most highly rated in the literature. These green spaces’ biodiversity and naturalness contribute to human well-being through improvements in health (particularly mental health) and good social relations. The most frequently methods used to assess the relationship of public urban green spaces and human well-being are mainly oriented towards studying perception of the green space’s users. This result highlights an opportunity to assess the congruence between methods evaluating perception and objective measurement. Our findings may provide tools for decision-makers to integrate green spaces into planning, identifying specific characteristics of public urban green spaces that promote human well-being and to face climate change.

AB  - Clinical tools to guide treatment decisions in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL) are limited. Moreover, the translational potential of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) remains largely unproven. We designed and applied panel-based duplex sequencing of ctDNA to study molecular determinants of response and outcome in 58 R/R MCL patients treated with venetoclax, lenalidomide, and rituximab. Genetic analysis revealed molecular predictors of response that were independent of clinical prognostic factors, with SMARCA4-mutated R/R MCLs responding to therapy, whereas TP53 mutations conferred resistance. Pretreatment ctDNA captured spatial heterogeneity, and its concentration was associated with multiple clinicopathological disease features and survival, independently of molecular predictors. Dynamic ctDNA assessment for minimal residual disease complemented clinical response evaluation and uncovered refractoriness in patients with molecular remission according to contemporary real-time quantitative PCR assay. Features of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) at baseline were associated with hematological toxicity during treatment and poor outcomes on follow-up. Positive selection of TP53-related CH during treatment did not compromise the specificity of ctDNA response analysis, and fragmentation signatures allowed distinction between MCL ctDNA and CH-bearing cfDNA. Taken together, we report novel features in MCL ctDNA that reveal new minimally invasive tools that could potentially transform clinical decision-making in R/R MCL.

AB  - Initial developments in Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) led to the development of Web Services using the SOAP protocol and an extensive set of tools and methods for composing new services from those existing. Subsequently, other types of services also emerged, such as event-oriented services and RESTful services. Nevertheless, all mentioned service types expose data and functionality, and users can benefit from their composition, regardless of the service type chosen for their implementation. In the Internet of Things, it is relevant to employ event-oriented services for sensing and SOAP, RESTful or lightweight web APIs for control. In the emerging field of microservices, heterogeneity is embraced as a design principle and services that are part of a single system may be implemented using heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. The research question of this review is: How heterogeneous services can be composed? There are several surveys that cover service composition with each of the existing service types, but the composition of heterogeneous services is only marginally addressed. This systematic literature review focuses explicitly on the heterogeneity of the aforementioned service types. A total of 66 documents, published from 2005 to 2018, have been surveyed, targeting all possible combinations of the three service types. In addition to summarizing existing works, the specific methods employed for supporting service type heterogeneity are grouped into archetypes and have their limitations and capabilities analyzed. Despite the large number of documents found, there are several open issues on heterogeneous service composition. The results of this review are confronted with emerging fields in service computing, namely microservices, serverless and IoT, yielding additional research directions.

AB  - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common chronic blood cancer in adults. Active NOTCH signaling in CLL is associated with poorer prognosis. Importantly, CLL patients with NOTCH1 non-coding mutations in the 3-prime untranslated region (3’UTR) manifested with a more aggressive disease course even compared to those with mutations in the NOTCH1 coding region. Here, we comprehensively characterize a cryptic splice acceptor site in 3’UTR of the NOTCH1 gene being converted into a stronger site. The functional consequences of the resulting NOTCH1 protein variants depend on the exact localization of the splice site, the used open reading frame and the appearance of the next STOP codon. The most frequent 3’UTR mutation (g.139390152, A>G) generates a novel NOTCH1 protein, lacking the PEST domain but expressing an altered C-terminus consisting of 68 amino acids. Mechanistically, we show that this splice variant (NOTCH1 152) is transcriptionally less active and dysregulates the regular ubiquitination dependent degradation of the wild type NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) in trans. Thus, the NOTCH1 152 variant acts as a “sponge” protein in a novel mechanism of oncogenic NOTCH signaling activation, explaining the detrimental disease outcome of CLL patients with non-coding NOTCH1 mutations. We propose that the detection of NOTCH1 152 protein by specific antibodies is a useful prognostic marker for CLL patients.

AB  - Objectives
This study compared the clinical performance of glass ionomer cement (GIC) compared to composite resin (CR) in Class II restorations in primary teeth.
Data
Literature search according to PRISMA guidelines including randomized controlled trials comparing Class II restorations performed with GIC, compared to CR, in primary teeth. Sources: PubMeb, Scopus, Web of Science, VHL, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials and OpenGrey, regardless of date or language.
Study
Ten studies were included in qualitative synthesis, and 9 in the meta-analyses (MA). Six studies were classified as low risk of bias, and 4 as “unclear”. Heterogeneity ranged from null to high (0% to 73%). GIC and CR presented similar failure patterns (risk difference −0.04 [−0.11, 0.03]; p = 0.25, I2 = 51%), and the exclusion of studies with follow-up period <24 months, or grouping according to the type of GIC (conventional or resin-modified), or according to the type of isolation (cotton roll or rubber dam), or according to the evaluation criteria applied did not affect the pattern of the results obtained. GIC exhibited significantly lower values of secondary carious lesions (SCL) than CR (SCL: risk difference 0.06 [0.02, 0.10], p = 0.008, I2 = 0%). The materials presented similar performance (p > 0.05) regarding the overall effect, as well as for marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation and anatomical form. The superiority of GIC was maintained when resin-modified GIC and rubber dam isolation were analyzed separately.
Conclusions
GIC and CR presented similar clinical performance for all criteria analyzed, except for secondary carious lesions, in which GIC presented superior performance, especially for the resin-modified GIC and with rubber dam isolation.

AB  - This paper takes the occasion of French DJ David Guetta's use of generative AI tools to create lyrics and a voice in the style of Eminem, which he then used in one of his concerts, as the basis for an exploration of the shifting meaning of creativity and originality in the age of generative AI. Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before. The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright – specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law – is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human – corporate – machine) creators have always created hybrid-networked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier – and influential – models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI “generates” artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.

AB  - Objective
The aim of this study was to systematically review and assess the accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the measurement of alveolar bone height and thickness.
Study Design
MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the gray literature were searched to identify all relevant articles published before July 2018. The Quality Assessment of Measurement Accuracy Studies tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed to analyze the mean differences in alveolar bone height and thickness measurements between CBCT and gold standard references (direct measurement on human skulls or live patients).
Results
In total, 28 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 18 were included in the quantitative synthesis. The meta-analysis results showed that the mean differences between CBCT measurements and the gold standard references for alveolar bone height (mean difference = 0.03 mm; 95% confidence interval –0.03 to 0.08; P = .382) and alveolar bone thickness (mean difference = 0.11 mm; 95% confidence interval –0.02 to 0.24; P = .088) were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Current evidence suggests that there is no significant difference between CBCT and the gold standard references for the measurement of alveolar bone height and thickness.

Employing co-citation and text-mining techniques to investigate 281 articles, we identified five knowledge fields that map the intellectual structure of this domain: brand equity, industrial branding, brand value, global brand leadership, and relationship marketing. We also gained a deeper understanding of the important topics in global B2B branding literature. This framework not only highlights gaps and challenges in conceptual and methodological approaches but also challenges and extends existing academic discourse. It offers a systematic approach to strategic decision-making and the overhaul of marketing practices, guiding practitioners to navigate the complexities of global B2B branding. Our critical analysis sets a new agenda for future research, calling for a more rigorous and holistic advancement in the field of global B2B branding.

AB  - The body’s innate and acquiredimmunesystems are critical in responses to a wide spectrum of assaults, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identify studies of autoimmunity to support our hypothesis that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) may put children at increased risk for severe COVID-19 sequelae; especially those whose viral load is high and/or who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and death, even in otherwise healthy children. As information and evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to expand, our hypothesis suggests adding a potentially intriguing piece to the pandemic puzzle for further investigation. Drawing on a select review of published research and case reports, we discuss immune dysregulation in paediatric patients with a high IQ, including post-infection cytokine expression in the myocardium. Further, we provide a review of 27 paediatric (≤19 years; median age 16) cases of severe COVID-19 outcomes, drawn from media sources published between March and September 2020, in which we identify possible evidence of a ‘hyper brain, hyper body’ response to infection. We aver these cases are noteworthy given that paediatric death with COVID-19 disease is remarkably rare, and the estimated prevalence of a high IQ (or giftedness) is only 2% in the general population. These observations warrant prospective and retrospective studies of autoinflammatory markers and mechanisms to elucidate any special psychoneuroimmunological vulnerability in children with a high IQ, as such studies may raise implications for how and when prophylactic medical care is provided to children.

AB  - Membrane distillation (MD) is a non-isothermal separation process applied mainly in desalination for the treatment of saline aqueous solutions including brines for distilled water production by different technological configurations. Various experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out in practically all related MD fields. However, no research study has been conducted yet evaluating the MD literature with data analysis, bibliometric methods, and machine learning approaches. This study includes an in-depth review of MD published papers in refereed international journals. Interesting statistical and graphical information on MD is presented. By using different indexes of bibliometric analysis, significant papers, authors more active in MD research, and the corresponding institutions and countries that have contributed most to the progress of MD technology are presented together with the collaborations made between research groups. The most used MD configurations, combined separation processes and types of treated water are revealed with the most considered materials in MD membrane engineering. With text mining approaches, the most commonly used words, keywords, and trending topics are analyzed highlighting those MD aspects that merit further investigation helping MD advance towards its industrial implementation. Sentiment analysis of papers abstracts indicates that 75.3 % of authors have optimistic views on MD technology.

AB  - Several studies have indicated that a global reduction in meat consumption is inevitable for sustainability and public health, despite the challenges inherent to changing eating habits. The purpose of this article is to pursue a stock-take of consumer behavior with regard to reducing meat consumption through a literature review using bibliometric analysis. The findings show the multidisciplinary nature of the field, which is in full development and with many knowledge gaps. Publications are concentrated in a few dominant journals and originated exclusively in developed countries. Six thematic subareas are central to the theme in question and helped to structure the field. The findings also show that few authors have been recurrent in publications on the subject and that three thematic groups represent promising areas for future research: behavior, sustainability, and interventions. The contributions of this article lie in the fact that helps organizations and researchers achieve a panoramic view of the field, identifying unanswered questions and possible partners for research. From a practical perspective, this research can also support new studies to develop public policies aimed at reducing (or replacing) meat consumption or encouraging enterprises and investments related to alternative products for conventional meat.

AB  - Objective
To assess and analyze the impact of clinical simulation as a training tool in healthcare teams ability to resolve and manage conflicts, through an exploratory systematic review.
Methods
A structured literature review was performed with the terms [Clinical Simulation OR Patient Simulation OR Simulation Training OR High Fidelity simulation Training] AND [Conflict OR Conflict Resolution] in the following databases: MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane, Scielo, PubMed, CINHAL, ScienceDirect, MEDES, IBECS y DOCUMED. Articles were considered if they involved clinical simulation oriented to training of healthcare professionals or trainees in conflict management, using clinical scenarios, and excluding those studies older than 20 years. Absence of debriefing was not considered an exclusion criterion, neither the use of simulation along with other methodologies. A quantitative analysis was performed.
Results
10 articles were retrieved, mostly with quasi-experimental designs, in which clinical simulation was designed as an interprofessional training and was used with multiple other methodologies like roleplay, reflexive practice and audiovisual aids, strategy that suggest an increase its effectivity. Different scenarios have been recreated, like decision-making divergences and management of medical errors, in order to apply the competences of mediation, communication, emotional skills among others, and followed by debriefing. The use of validated scales and conventional assessment methods reveal a positive impact on satisfaction, perception and learning of students, as well as transfer to clinical practice and decrease in errors.
Conclusion
Multiple studies describe and support the use of clinical simulation for training in management and resolution of conflicts among healthcare professionals. Simulation is accepted by participants, developing transfer of skills and competences and impact at the organizational level. Nonetheless, studies are recent and limited in number, making this area a developing field that promotes future research.

AB  - Alkali-activated binders are sustainable alternatives to carbon-intensive conventional cements. A comprehensive review of the potential of different agro-waste ashes and their performance as precursors in alkali-activated binders are essential to enable their acceptance in the construction sector. Hence, the present study focusses on a systematic review of the alkali-activation of bagasse ash, rice husk ash, corn cob ash, palm oil fuel ash, wheat straw ash, and sugarcane straw ash. Moreover, their influence on the mechanical and durability characteristics of alkali-activated concrete is also presented. Based on the review, it is found that except for rice husk ash, all the other agro-waste ashes have almost similar silica content as that of fly ash. The morphologies of the different agro-waste ashes are found to be distinct. Incorporation of agro-waste ashes in fly ash-based binders results in better resistance to acid attack than slag-based binders. Addition of agro-waste ashes brought down the drying shrinkage of slag-based binders significantly. Ambient curing is beneficial for bagasse ash-based alkali-activated mortar specimens. Water absorption is higher for agro-waste ash based alkali-activated binder specimens due to the porous cellular structure of agro-waste ashes. Enhanced performance at elevated temperatures is observed for agro-waste ash based alkali-activated binders. Rice husk ash-based binders are remarkably stable at elevated temperatures.

AB  - Assessing the quality of urban areas is considered as a difficult task. The main reason lies in the multidisciplinary nature of the field, and in the complexity of components that must be accounted for. This study aims to identify the most discussed topics in literature by weighing the main themes currently under investigation and defining their potential interdependencies. We provide a theoretical and conceptual framework to analyze contributions in literature on urban quality assessment in the city of the future by combining a bibliographic analysis and a multi-criteria approach. In detail, we reviewed literature and implemented a methodological approach, which combines a bibliometric analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). According to the principal keywords “urban quality assessment” and “future city”, we initially identified in SCOPUS database 1024 articles and a selection of most cited sub-keywords. Then we fine-tuned the research according to a sequential approach. We performed a statistical analysis on preliminary results and implemented a relative AHP model to obtain a priority ranking of the most relevant sub-keywords. This approach allows for analyzing articles, by combining multiple keywords with the identification of the degree of relationship among the different sub-keywords with respect to the main topic.

AB  - Resumen
Objetivo
El objetivo de este trabajo fue realizar una revisión sistemática para conocer los efectos que tiene un programa de ejercicio de resistencia en pacientes con linfedema asociado a cáncer de mama o en riesgo de presentarlo.
Estrategia de búsqueda
Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica durante el mes de febrero de 2017 en el buscador PubMed y en las bases de datos Medline, Cinahl, PEDro y Scopus utilizando los siguientes términos MESH: lymphedema, Exercise Therapy, Therapeutic exercise y Resistance Training.
Selección de estudios
Tras la aplicación de los criterios de inclusión (ensayos clínicos publicados en revistas científicas, entre el 1/01/2012 y el 31/03/2017, en idioma castellano o inglés y con programa de ejercicio efectuado sobre mujeres) y de exclusión (artículos duplicados y aquellos que no tuviesen relación con el objetivo descrito en el trabajo) se obtuvieron un total de 13 artículos, en los cuales se somete a los sujetos a un programa de ejercicios de resistencia.
Síntesis de resultados
La mayoría de los estudios analizados muestran una baja calidad metodológica medida con la escala PEDro. En 11 de ellos participan mujeres con linfedema asociado a cáncer de mama, mientras que en los otros 2 las participantes presentan riesgo de padecer linfedema posmastectomía. Los resultados de esta revisión muestran que tanto las mujeres con linfedema asociado a cáncer de mama como las que tienen riesgo de padecerlo pueden llevar a cabo un programa de entrenamiento de resistencia sin exacerbar el linfedema.
Conclusión
Los datos obtenidos hacen pensar que este tipo de pacientes pueden llevar a cabo un programa de ejercicios de resistencia sin miedo a exacerbar su dolencia, consiguiendo en el proceso un aumento de la fuerza muscular y una mejor calidad de vida.
Objective
The objective of this review was to test the effects of a resistance exercise programme in patients with or at risk of breast cancer-associated lymphoedema.
Search strategy
A literature search conducted during the month of February 2017 in the PubMed search engine and in the Medline, Cinahl, PEDro and Scopus databases using the following MESH terms: lymphedema, Exercise Therapy, Therapeutic exercise and Resistance Training.
Selection of studies
A total of 13 articles were obtained after the inclusion criteria were applied (clinical trials published in scientific journals between 01/01/2012 and 03/31/2017, in Spanish or English and with an exercise programme undertaken by women); and the exclusion criteria (duplicate articles and articles unrelated to the objective of the paper).
Synthesis of results
Most of the studies analysed were of poor methodological quality as measured by the PEDro scale. Women with breast cancer-associated lymphoedema participated in 11 studies and women at risk of postmastectomy lymphoedema participated in the remaining 2. The results of this review show that both women with breast cancer-associated lymphoedema and those at risk can undergo resistance training without exacerbating lymphoedema.
Conclusion
The data obtained suggest that these patients can carry out a resistance exercise programme without fear of exacerbating their disease, achieving in the process increased muscle strength and a better quality of life.

AB  - Background
Methodological rigor is a fundamental factor in the validity and credibility of the results of a meta-analysis.
Aim
Following an increasing interest in single-case experimental design (SCED) meta-analyses, the current study investigates the methodological quality of SCED meta-analyses.
Methods and procedures
We assessed the methodological quality of 178 SCED meta-analyses published between 1985 and 2015 through the modified Revised-Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (R-AMSTAR) checklist.
Outcomes and results
The main finding of the current review is that the methodological quality of the SCED meta-analyses has increased over time, but is still low according to the R-AMSTAR checklist. A remarkable percentage of the studies (93.80% of the included SCED meta-analyses) did not even reach the midpoint score (22, on a scale of 0–44). The mean and median methodological quality scores were 15.57 and 16, respectively. Relatively high scores were observed for “providing the characteristics of the included studies” and “doing comprehensive literature search”. The key areas of deficiency were “reporting an assessment of the likelihood of publication bias” and “using the methods appropriately to combine the findings of studies”.
Conclusions and implications
Although the results of the current review reveal that the methodological quality of the SCED meta-analyses has increased over time, still more efforts are needed to improve their methodological quality.

AB  - During the last decade, e-commerce has increased last-mile deliveries, impacting the (CO2) emissions footprint. Considering this environmental impact, sustainable technologies have emerged for transport operations, e.g., drones and electric vehicles. This paper deals with the Location-Routing Problem for delivering orders to a set of customers. The problem aims to minimize the total CO2 emissions due to freight transportation in last-mile deliveries with Trucks-and-Drones. A mathematical model is proposed for solving the problem. We test the model in different scenarios varying the number of clients (between 10 and 25), the number of trucks and drones (between 4 and 12 and between 5 and 13, respectively), and the available depots (i.e., between 5 and 15 parking lots). Our results provide insights on how shifting to cleaner transportation technologies can aid in the reduction of the carbon footprint of distribution activities and present a preamble of the significant impact that UAVs have in parcel delivery routing problems.

KW  - Asia pacific region
AB  - The indigenous people uphold their cultural and social uniqueness, and social, economic, cultural, and political institutions, by detaching from the main or bigger society or culture. Similar to other groups, indigenous people are facing the formidable impacts of climate change due to their high reliance on nature stability. However there were still insufficient studies that systematically review the existing literature on the indigenous people in the Asia pacific region. Hence the present article conducted a systematic literature review on the adaptation strategies towards climate change impacts among the indigenous people in Asia Pacific regions. The present study integrated multiple research designs and the review was based on the publication standard, namely ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses). This study selected articles using two leading databases namely Scopus and Web of Science and one supporting database namely Google Scholar. Based on the thematic analysis, this review has seven main themes namely 1) technology assisted; 2) traditional and local knowledge; 3) livelihood diversity; 4) government and organizations support; 5) food and water securities; 6) social related activities and 7) physical infrastructure. The seven main themes have further produced 20 sub-themes. The study offered several significant contributions for practical purposes and the body of knowledge. The findings explained the importance of integrating indigenous knowledge into adaptation strategies, as follow: 1) to encourage respect for traditional knowledge and the role of indigenous peoples in policy development; 2) to strategise adaptation plan that is in line with the needs, abilities and interests of the indigenous people; and 3) to inform on the specific areas and content of researches that should be the focus of the future studies.

AB  - Refrigerators consume a large amount of energy every year around the world. The gasket is an important component in a refrigerator, and its sealing and thermal insulation properties have a significant influence on the refrigeration performance and the energy efficiency level of a refrigerator. This study presents a comprehensive review of key technologies related to the refrigerator gasket. Since 1920, with the improvement of sealing and thermal insulation requirements, the structure and materials of refrigerator gaskets have changed greatly. The CFD technique is an effective method to study the heat transfer characteristics of gasket with the complexity of structure. An indirect test method is usually used to estimate the heat transfer load based on the Reverse Heat Loss Method (RHLM) with the assistance of heat flux sensors. The air infiltration through gasket is mainly dependent on the flow gaps, the pressure difference between the cabinet inside and outside, and the flow type. The tracer gas technology can be introduced to quantify the mass transfer through gasket. The energy-saving design of gasket structure is also introduced in this article. The material formulation is the key factor to determine the migration resistance and mechanical properties. This review is expected to motivate future researches on refrigerator gasket.

AB  - Polymorphism is the ability of a compound to exist in multiple crystal forms while maintaining the same chemical composition. This phenomenon is reflected in different solid-state physicochemical properties due to variations in structural energy and the degree of lattice disorder. The pharmaceutical industry places significant emphasis on thoroughly characterizing polymorphism in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) because of its impact on the pharmacokinetic properties on the final medicine product. Standard characterization techniques are well documented in pharmacopeias and by international agencies. These techniques, whether applied individually or in combination, include crystallography (X-Ray Diffraction), thermal analysis (Differential Scanning Calorimetry), and various forms of spectroscopy, such as Near-Infrared, Raman, and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Analyzing NMR applications for solid-state characterization over the past five years, there has been a growing number of reports on the use of Time Domain NMR (TD-NMR) to evaluate polymorphism on APIs. Due to the increasing interest in this compelling technique, this study provides an overview of the current advancements in TD-NMR for polymorphism assessment in pharmaceutical products. Compared to high-field devices, TD-NMR has proven to be more convenient to industrial applications due to its smaller equipment size and shorter measurement times. This mini-review compares various applications of TD-NMR for API solid-state characterization and offer guidance for future research in this area.

AB  - Technology forecasting (TF) based on bibliometric tools allows knowing the technological trends of developed topics based on experience and current knowledge, thus anticipating future changes. To reduce hunger and improve nutrition, the food-based topic is of central concern, especially functional food. Among these, various studies on chocolates have been performed. On a global scale, these products are at the level of patents, with China leading it, vastly outperforming the cocoa-producing countries. Though no known functional chocolates are sold under that specific name, chocolates on the market serve as "carriers" of bioactive compounds. Unfortunately, they cannot be attributed to health properties since these properties have to be evaluated with in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Launching functional chocolate on the market is possible; however, it would be a long-term process involving previous stages such as studying its ingredients' bioactive properties, laboratory-level product development, functional properties, and quality and acceptance parameters. For research purposes, it is possible to speak of functional chocolates, potentially functional chocolates, or chocolates enriched with bioactive compounds since the development of research does not necessarily involve launching the product on the market.

AB  - Automation modifies workplaces, tools, and production activities, leading to new modalities of human-machine interaction. Traditionally, the allocation of functions in automated systems is static over time, i.e., functions are assigned to humans or machines. Adaptive Automation (AA) makes functions allocation dynamic, resulting from system conditions, performance, and human attributes to face emerging or unpredictable contingencies, and to cope with traditional automation challenges and limits. Tracing the evolutionary stages of the topic, the paper provides an extensive literature review. First, the review details the current definition of AA, the starting motivations for AA, and the temporal evolution of the topic considering the pioneers’ theories. Then, the paper presents the design elements involved in AA systems, i.e., the Level Of Automation (LOA), the Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), and the different approaches than can guide the adaptive shift. Finally, the practical applications of AA in manufacturing are reported. In such a way, the research offers the state of the art of the topic, providing the main distinguishing features between static and AA, also outlining the open challenges and the future developments in manufacturing.

AB  - The domain of nutrigenetics investigates the complex relationship between genetic variations and individual dietary responses, encompassing a wide array of disciplines, including genomics, nutrition science, bioinformatics, and personalized medicine. This field is marked by its intricate data landscape, necessitating innovative approaches to effectively manage and interpret the vast volumes of information involved. Given nutrigenetic data sheer volume and complexity, traditional AI models often struggle to maintain comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy to address the question-answering task in nutrigenetic domain. This framework enhances the accuracy and relevancy of outputs produced by an advanced Large Language Model, circumventing the exhaustive model fine-tuning process. As a result, our RAG approach not only alleviates the computational demand but also fortifies against data leakage concerns, particularly critical in the sensitive area of nutrigenetics. The implementation of RAG in the nutrigenetic domain not only addresses the existing challenges but also paves the way for more advanced and efficient exploration of nutrigenetic data. Our proposed workflow could advance the understanding of nutrigenetic interactions and personalized nutrition.

AB  - Summary
Background
General anaesthesia (GA) during endovascular thrombectomy has been associated with worse patient outcomes in observational studies compared with patients treated without GA. We assessed functional outcome in ischaemic stroke patients with large vessel anterior circulation occlusion undergoing endovascular thrombectomy under GA, versus thrombectomy not under GA (with or without sedation) versus standard care (ie, no thrombectomy), stratified by the use of GA versus standard care.
Methods
For this meta-analysis, patient-level data were pooled from all patients included in randomised trials in PuMed published between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2017, that compared endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients (HERMES Collaboration). The primary outcome was functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days in the GA and non-GA subgroups of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus those patients treated with standard care, adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with a random effect for trials incorporated in all models. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane method. The meta-analysis was prospectively designed, but not registered.
Findings
Seven trials were identified by our search; of 1764 patients included in these trials, 871 were allocated to endovascular thrombectomy and 893 were assigned standard care. After exclusion of 74 patients (72 did not undergo the procedure and two had missing data on anaesthetic strategy), 236 (30%) of 797 patients who had endovascular procedures were treated under GA. At baseline, patients receiving GA were younger and had a shorter delay between stroke onset and randomisation but they had similar pre-treatment clinical severity compared with patients who did not have GA. Endovascular thrombectomy improved functional outcome at 3 months both in patients who had GA (adjusted common odds ratio (cOR) 1·52, 95% CI 1·09–2·11, p=0·014) and in those who did not have GA (adjusted cOR 2·33, 95% CI 1·75–3·10, p<0·0001) versus standard care. However, outcomes were significantly better for patients who did not receive GA versus those who received GA (covariate-adjusted cOR 1·53, 95% CI 1·14–2·04, p=0·0044). The risk of bias and variability between studies was assessed to be low.
Interpretation
Worse outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy were associated with GA, after adjustment for baseline prognostic variables. These data support avoidance of GA whenever possible. The procedure did, however, remain effective versus standard care in patients treated under GA, indicating that treatment should not be withheld in those who require anaesthesia for medical reasons.

AB  - Summary
Background
Evidence regarding whether imaging can be used effectively to select patients for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is scarce. We aimed to investigate the association between baseline imaging features and safety and efficacy of EVT in acute ischaemic stroke caused by anterior large-vessel occlusion.
Methods
In this meta-analysis of individual patient-level data, the HERMES collaboration identified in PubMed seven randomised trials in endovascular stroke that compared EVT with standard medical therapy, published between Jan 1, 2010, and Oct 31, 2017. Only trials that required vessel imaging to identify patients with proximal anterior circulation ischaemic stroke and that used predominantly stent retrievers or second-generation neurothrombectomy devices in the EVT group were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane handbook methodology. Central investigators, masked to clinical information other than stroke side, categorised baseline imaging features of ischaemic change with the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) or according to involvement of more than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory, and by thrombus volume, hyperdensity, and collateral status. The primary endpoint was neurological functional disability scored on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days after randomisation. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, parenchymal haematoma type 2 within 5 days of randomisation, and mortality within 90 days. For the primary analysis, we used mixed-methods ordinal logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, intravenous alteplase, and time from onset to randomisation, and we used interaction terms to test whether imaging categorisation at baseline modifies the association between treatment and outcome. This meta-analysis was prospectively designed by the HERMES executive committee but has not been registered.
Findings
Among 1764 pooled patients, 871 were allocated to the EVT group and 893 to the control group. Risk of bias was low except in the THRACE study, which used unblinded assessment of outcomes 90 days after randomisation and MRI predominantly as the primary baseline imaging tool. The overall treatment effect favoured EVT (adjusted common odds ratio [cOR] for a shift towards better outcome on the mRS 2·00, 95% CI 1·69–2·38; p<0·0001). EVT achieved better outcomes at 90 days than standard medical therapy alone across a broad range of baseline imaging categories. Mortality at 90 days (14·7% vs 17·3%, p=0·15), symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (3·8% vs 3·5%, p=0·90), and parenchymal haematoma type 2 (5·6% vs 4·8%, p=0·52) did not differ between the EVT and control groups. No treatment effect modification by baseline imaging features was noted for mortality at 90 days and parenchymal haematoma type 2. Among patients with ASPECTS 0–4, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was seen in ten (19%) of 52 patients in the EVT group versus three (5%) of 66 patients in the control group (adjusted cOR 3·94, 95% CI 0·94–16·49; pinteraction=0·025), and among patients with more than 33% involvement of middle cerebral artery territory, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was observed in 15 (14%) of 108 patients in the EVT group versus four (4%) of 113 patients in the control group (4·17, 1·30–13·44, pinteraction=0·012).
Interpretation
EVT achieves better outcomes at 90 days than standard medical therapy across a broad range of baseline imaging categories, including infarcts affecting more than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory or ASPECTS less than 6, although in these patients the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was higher in the EVT group than the control group. This analysis provides preliminary evidence for potential use of EVT in patients with large infarcts at baseline.

AB  - Probiotic is the word that means “for life,” which is used to name microorganisms that are associated with beneficial effects for humans and animals. These microorganisms contribute to intestinal microbial balance and play an important role in health. Probiotic microorganisms consist mainly of bacteria and some yeasts. Various food matrices have been used with probiotics, but they can also be found in dairy and nondairy beverages that promote regular consumption, even for those who are lactose intolerant. They can also be successfully employed, for example, in some therapies such as in antibiotic therapy. The market of probiotic beverages is increasing exponentially with the constant development of new probiotic strains, with higher stability and adaptation, and beverages’ formulation, with new matrices development, but also due to the world population health concern. This chapter brings advancements in probiotic beverages’ research and innovation with some examples of alternative solutions for this attractive market.

AB  - Background
With advances in technology, the adoption of wearable devices has become a viable adjunct in poststroke rehabilitation. Upper limb (UL) impairment affects up to 77% of stroke survivors impacting on their ability to carry out everyday activities. However, despite an increase in research exploring these devices for UL rehabilitation, little is known of their effectiveness.
Objective
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of UL wearable technology for improving activity and participation in adult stroke survivors.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized comparable trials of UL wearable technology for poststroke rehabilitation were included. Primary outcome measures were validated measures of activity and participation as defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Databases searched were MEDLINE, Web of Science (Core collection), CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the RCTs and the Downs and Black Instrument for the quality of non RCTs.
Results
In the review, we included 11 studies with collectively 354 participants at baseline and 323 participants at final follow-up including control groups and participants poststroke. Participants’ stroke type and severity varied. Only 1 study found significant between-group differences for systems functioning and activity (P≤.02). The 11 included studies in this review had small sample sizes ranging from 5 to 99 participants at an average (mean) age of 57 years.
Conclusions
This review has highlighted a number of reasons for insignificant findings in this area including low sample sizes and the appropriateness of the methodology for complex interventions. However, technology has the potential to measure outcomes, provide feedback, and engage users outside of clinical sessions. This could provide a platform for motivating stroke survivors to carry out more rehabilitation in the absence of a therapist, which could maximize recovery.

AB  - Background
Exposure to seasonal environmental factors during gestation or early in the postnatal period could influence the development of autoimmunity, determining a seasonality in the month of birth (MOB). There are studies evaluating this potential seasonality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), and Addison's disease (ADD), but results have been controversial.
Methods
Systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines, using PubMed, Web of Science and WorldCat databases (2005–2020) of studies that explored the association between the seasonality of the MOB and T1D, AITD and ADD. Information on sex and age, location, methodology and internal quality, seasonal patterns, hypotheses and other factors proposed to explain seasonality were extracted. Differences in season and month of birth were further discussed.
Results
The initial search retrieved 300 articles, and after further screening, 11 articles fulfilled inclusion criteria and were finally selected and reviewed. 73% found a seasonal pattern and 64% showed birth peaks in spring and/or summer. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and women exhibited a higher seasonality. Ultraviolet radiation, Vitamin D levels and viral infections were identified as influencing factors.
Conclusions
The effect of certain seasonal factors during foetal development, reflected by the seasonal differences in the MOB, could contribute to the development of endocrine autoimmune diseases in predisposed patients. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed seasonality.
Resumen
Introducción
La exposición a factores ambientales durante la gestación o el periodo neonatal precoz puede condicionar el desarrollo de autoinmunidad, determinando una estacionalidad en el mes de nacimiento (MDN). Existen estudios que evalúan la potencial estacionalidad en pacientes con diabetes tipo 1 (DM1), enfermedad tiroidea autoinmune (ETAI) y enfermedad de Addison (ADD), con resultados controvertidos.
Material y métodos
Revisión sistemática, siguiendo las directrices PRISMA en los buscadores PubMed, Web of Science y WorldCat (2005-2020), de los estudios que exploran la asociación entre la estacionalidad del MDN y el desarrollo de DM1, ETAI y ADD. Se recogió información relativa al sexo, edad, localización geográfica, metodología, calidad, patrón estacional, hipótesis y otros factores potencialmente asociados.
Resultados
Tras una primera selección de 300 artículos, se incluyeron finalmente 11 que cumplían los criterios de inclusión. En el 73% se encontró un patrón estacional y en el 64% se encontró un pico de nacimientos en primavera y/o verano. La estacionalidad fue más evidente para la tiroiditis de Hashimoto y las mujeres. La radiación ultravioleta, vitamina D y las infecciones virales se identificaron como factores influyentes.
Conclusión
El efecto de algunos factores estacionales durante el desarrollo fetal, reflejo de las diferencias estacionales en el MDN, puede contribuir al desarrollo de enfermedades endocrinas autoinmunes en individuos predispuestos. Se necesitan más estudios para dilucidar los mecanismos subyacentes que expliquen dicha estacionalidad.

AB  - At present, there is a lack of detailed understanding and research on the pathogenesis and treatment of Hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (HIGM), Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES), and hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS), and few studies have been conducted to correlate the pathogenesis and treatment of the three disorders. The existing studies are rarely related to the three diseases. We searched PubMed for a large number of relevant literature and analyzed and summarized the contents. We analyzed and introduced the three diseases and their Categorization, Epidemiology, Clinical manifestations, Laboratory diagnosis, and Treatment by means of tables and Figures. It is hoped that this analysis and summary can play a certain role in the research and treatment of related diseases and promote the understanding and prevention of related diseases.

AB  - Empty storage shelves and long customer lead times due to a sharp rise in market demand from industries on the one hand (e.g., pharmaceutical products). On the other hand, increasing short-term working or unemployment due to a rapid decline in demand (e.g., automotive). Current supply and demand gaps caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remind us that successful competition in volatile business environments requires rapid adjustments of production capacities. Capacity management (CM) addresses these adjustments by adapting production capacity to market demand. Operations managers of flexible manufacturing systems can adjust the capacity by using various levers (e.g., overtime, used machines, …). To guide these managers, decision support systems (DSS) exist for short-term CM (e.g., shop floor scheduling). However, due to complexity and runtime problems, the decision-making process for medium-term CM is usually carried out with low technical support. Increases in computing power and advances in algorithm performance over the past decades have enabled Machine Learning to solve ever more complex problems such as the aforementioned issues. Reinforcement Learning (RL) in particular has shown good performance in solving short-term CM problems when compared to humans or other established heuristics. In this work we review the current literature for CM using RL in flexible manufacturing systems. We identify an existing lack of knowledge within the overlap of medium-term CM and RL. However, good performance of RL in short-term CM indicates that an application in medium-term CM should be evaluated. In addition, we propose a concept of a method for medium-term CM based on RL to support operations managers in the decision-making process. The resulting DSS could have a significant impact on production performance, especially in terms of capacity adjustment speed.

The purpose of this investigation is to identify, evaluate, integrate and summarize relevant and qualified papers through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of recommender systems (RSs) to suggest a scholarly publication venue for researcher's paper.
Design/methodology/approach
To identify the relevant papers published up to August 11, 2018, an SLR study on four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) was conducted. We pursued the guidelines presented by Kitchenham and Charters (2007) for performing SLRs in software engineering. The papers were analyzed based on data sources, RSs classes, techniques/methods/algorithms, datasets, evaluation methodologies and metrics, as well as future directions.
Findings
A total of 32 papers were identified. The most data sources exploited in these papers were textual (title/abstract/keywords) and co-authorship data. The RS classes in the selected papers were almost equally used. DBLP was the main dataset utilized. Cosine similarity, social network analysis (SNA) and term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF–IDF) algorithm were frequently used. In terms of evaluation methodologies, 24 papers applied only offline evaluations. Furthermore, precision, accuracy and recall metrics were the popular performance metrics. In the reviewed papers, “use more datasets” and “new algorithms” were frequently mentioned in the future work part as well as conclusions.
Originality/value
Given that a review study has not been conducted in this area, this paper can provide an insight into the current status in this area and may also contribute to future research in this field.

AB  - Background
The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to verify the existence and level of scientific evidence concerning the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS), as the main exposure, and tooth loss (TL), as the outcome.
Types of Studies Reviewed
Through electronic databases and partially through gray literature, the authors identified observational studies in adults. The authors used no date or language restrictions. The authors evaluated the studies’ methodological quality by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The authors conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis. The authors assessed the quality of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria.
Results
Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria, and 9 were retained for the meta-analysis. Most were cross-sectional studies with good methodological quality. Participants with MetS had fewer teeth (standardized mean difference, −2.77; 95% confidence interval, −4.56 to −0.98) and an increased likelihood of lacking functional dentition (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.89 to 2.96) than did those without MetS. The overall quality of evidence was very low.
Conclusions and Practical Implications
Better-conducted longitudinal studies are necessary to establish a causal relationship between MetS and TL to inform the best strategies to prevent TL in populations with MetS.

AB  - Background
New technologies are set to profoundly change the way we understand and manage psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Developments in imaging and biomarkers, along with medical informatics, may well allow for better assessments and interventions in the future. Recent advances in the concept of digital phenotype, which involves using computerized measurement tools to capture the characteristics of a given psychiatric disorder, is one paradigmatic example.
Objective
The impact of new technologies on health professionals’ practice in OCD care remains to be determined. Recent developments could disrupt not just their clinical practices, but also their beliefs, ethics, and representations, even going so far as to question their professional culture. This study aimed to conduct an extensive review of new technologies in OCD.
Methods
We conducted the review by looking for titles in the PubMed database up to December 2017 that contained the following terms: [Obsessive] AND [Smartphone] OR [phone] OR [Internet] OR [Device] OR [Wearable] OR [Mobile] OR [Machine learning] OR [Artificial] OR [Biofeedback] OR [Neurofeedback] OR [Momentary] OR [Computerized] OR [Heart rate variability] OR [actigraphy] OR [actimetry] OR [digital] OR [virtual reality] OR [Tele] OR [video].
Results
We analyzed 364 articles, of which 62 were included. Our review was divided into 3 parts: prediction, assessment (including diagnosis, screening, and monitoring), and intervention.
Conclusions
The review showed that the place of connected objects, machine learning, and remote monitoring has yet to be defined in OCD. Smartphone assessment apps and the Web Screening Questionnaire demonstrated good sensitivity and adequate specificity for detecting OCD symptoms when compared with a full-length structured clinical interview. The ecological momentary assessment procedure may also represent a worthy addition to the current suite of assessment tools. In the field of intervention, CBT supported by smartphone, internet, or computer may not be more effective than that delivered by a qualified practitioner, but it is easy to use, well accepted by patients, reproducible, and cost-effective. Finally, new technologies are enabling the development of new therapies, including biofeedback and virtual reality, which focus on the learning of coping skills. For them to be used, these tools must be properly explained and tailored to individual physician and patient profiles.

AB  - Background
The Stepped Care Model (SCM) proposes a sequential approach in the treatment of depression, applying interventions of increasing intensity according to the level of severity of the individual.
Methods
A systematic review was carried out until January 2020 in eight electronic databases. We included randomized (RCT) and non-randomized controlled trials comparing the SCM to usual non-sequential care.
Results
Eighteen RCT with patients with confirmed or probable depression diagnosis were included. Meta-analyses yielded high heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses showed significant effects of the SCM only in studies with baseline moderately severe symptoms on average, compared to samples with mild/moderate depression. In the former subgroup, effects at 3-6 and 9-12 months were small for symptoms’ reduction (g = -0.33, 95%CI: -0.55, -0.17 and -0.34, 95%CI: -0.53, -0.16) and moderate-to-strong in response and remission (Risk Ratios between 1.70-1.90). Overall, a significant benefit on quality of life was also observed (6 months: g = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.12, 0.49; 12 months: g = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.31). More patients in the SCM groups were prescribed antidepressants at 6 months (RR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.09, 1.57; I² = 87%).
Limitations
The search does not guarantee the identification of all the relevant literature. Most included studies show uncertain or high risk of bias.
Conclusions
The SCM seems to outperform usual care in populations with at least moderately severe symptoms on average. Results show high heterogeneity and future research should explore its sources.

AB  - Within the scheduling framework, the potential of digital twin (DT) technology, based on virtualisation and intelligent algorithms to simulate and optimise manufacturing, enables an interaction with processes and modifies their course of action in time synchrony in the event of disruptive events. This is a valuable capability for automating scheduling and confers it autonomy. Automatic and autonomous scheduling management can be encouraged by promoting the elimination of disruptions due to the appearance of defects, regardless of their origin. Hence the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model oriented towards zero-disturbance and zero-disruption objectives has barely been studied. Both strategies combine the optimisation of production processes by implementing DTs and promoting ZDM objectives to facilitate the modelling of automatic and autonomous scheduling systems. In this context, this particular vision of the scheduling process is called smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS). The aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on the scheduling problem that considers the DT technology approach and the ZDM model to achieve self-management and reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention. Specifically, 68 research articles were identified and analysed. The main results of this paper are to: (i) find methodological trends to approach SMS models, where three trends were identified; i.e. using DT technology and the ZDM model, utilising other enabling digital technologies and incorporating inherent SMS capabilities into scheduling; (ii) present the main SMS alignment axes of each methodological trend; (iii) provide a map to classify the literature that comes the closest to the SMS concept; (iv) discuss the main findings and research gaps identified by this study. Finally, managerial implications and opportunities for further research are identified.

AB  - Background
The purpose of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement was followed. Searches were carried out in six databases without restriction regarding publication year. Studies comparing periodontal clinical parameters among individuals submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy associated with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and a control group of individuals submitted to only non-surgical periodontal treatment were included. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment (RoB 2.0) were performed by two review authors. Meta-analysis was performed. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided.
Results
Two hundred and five studies were identified and 11 studies were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that antimicrobial photodynamic therapy adjunctive to periodontal therapy, in individuals with diabetes, resulted in a greater reduction of bleeding on probing at 6 months and in probing depth at 3 and 6 months in comparison to periodontal treatment alone (p<0.05). The included studies exhibited low risk of bias.
Conclusion
Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy adjunct to periodontal therapy contributes to the improvement of periodontal clinical parameter bleeding on probing and probing depth in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The growing need for sustainable waste management, especially for electronic waste (e-waste), has gained attention due to its environmental and economic implications. Despite the technological evolution of electronic products, their short lifespan and frequent replacement have led to a surge in discarded equipment. In particular, e-waste is rich in valuable materials, often exceeding natural ores. The challenge lies in the recycling of complex products, such as electrical or mechatronic systems, which consist of different materials. In addition, many of these discarded products are shipped to low-cost countries, leading to environmental concerns and health risks for workers. This paper explores the potential of automating the recycling process to address these challenges. This systematic literature review examines the emerging field of automated recycling for electronic products, with a focus on the transition to a circular economy. The results show that the literature on automated disassembly is highly focused on intelligent scheduling strategies, object recognition, sorting, tooling, disassembly, and robotic solutions, with particular emphasis on robotic cell design, robot kinematics, and human-robot collaboration. This review makes a significant contribution to the growing academic discourse on automated recycling and the circular economy, while laying the groundwork for future research and innovation by postulating a comprehensive research agenda.

AB  - Digital transformation has a significant impact on firm internationalization. This paper aims to provide a systematic literature review to analyze two decades of literature on key issues related to digital transformation at the individual, firm, and macro (international) levels and its impact on firms’ internationalization process. We show the impact of human (soft side) and non-human components (i.e., knowledge, leadership, digital servitization, technological) of digital transformation that can either allow or threaten it and their impact on firms’ internationalization. In addition, our findings show that digital transformation can positively and negatively impact firm internationalization at the individual, firm, and macro levels. Moreover, we review the existing theories related to digital transformation and internationalization and identify the current gaps in these theories. Finally, we provide directions for future research to address these gaps.

AB  - Restrictions enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with negative impacts on mental health and well-being. There is a need to support individuals to cope with these challenging circumstances. An embedded design mixed methods approach was employed to explore challenges experienced during the pandemic, the effectiveness of a photo-reflection intervention for enhancing coping, wellbeing, and resilience, and how this intervention functioned to impact on these outcomes. 108 participants were randomised to one of three photo-taking conditions; challenges experienced, coping strategies, or experiences and were assessed with measures of wellbeing, coping and resilience. In addition, open-ended survey questions were used to assess perceptions of experiences and of the effects of the intervention. There were no significant differences across the groups, however subjective psychological well-being, and emotional and functional well-being improved post-intervention regardless of intervention type. There was also an increase in planning and self-distraction coping for those whom the intervention elicited reflection. Qualitative data highlighted a range of challenges experienced and examples of both adaptive and maladaptive coping approaches. Photo-reflection intervention approaches may improve well-being and enhance coping during these challenging circumstances through providing opportunity to review and reflect on life experiences.

AB  - In the realm of sustainable architecture and construction, facade design plays a crucial role in regulating building energy consumption by controlling factors such as daylight and thermal comfort. Traditional approaches have evolved to incorporate geometric patterns like tessellations, which offer both aesthetic and functional benefits. However, understanding the intricate relationship between tessellation patterns and energy efficiency remains a complex task. Although numerous literature reviews exist on energy-efficient building facades, only a few have specifically addressed the geometric aspects of facade design and their impact on energy performance. This study conducts a systematic review of existing literature, employing the PRISMA framework to uncover the nuanced effects and potential limitations of tessellation patterns. Of the 611 papers identified in the initial search, a large number were excluded based on selection criteria and screening, leaving a total of 36 papers for review. Among these, 22 studies specifically focused on tessellated patterns. The review identifies significant gaps in the literature: 40 % of studies concentrated on static shading screens, while only 28 % and 23 % addressed static and dynamic double-skin facades, respectively. Research on dynamic shading screens remains largely unexplored. Daylight performance was the most studied energy indicator (73 %), while thermal performance accounted for only 18 % of the focus. Additionally, 62 % of the studies focused on hot-arid and semi-arid climates. These findings highlight the need for further research on dynamic shading screens, the integration of daylight and thermal performance, diverse climate contexts, sustainable materials, smart controls, and practical designs for real-world application. The significance of this study extends beyond academia to architects, urban planners, and policymakers involved in sustainable building design and construction.

AB  - Preclinical safety evaluations are critical to the regulatory review process to give regulators data upon which to judge risk in their risk/benefit evaluations. Biologicals’ toxicology is distinct from drug toxicology; even though the methods used may be the same—the study designs may be unique. In addition, unique methods, e.g., assessments of neurovirulence or attenuation, may be necessary. International guidance varies on the types and numbers of studies required; but whatever is done, the preclinical studies should be scientifically justified. Unique methods may be applied to these products, e.g., tissue cross-reactivity studies of MAbs. Evaluating the data requires experience with the animal model and being able to distinguish signal from noise. This requires judgment by experts in both toxicology and the product type under study. However, preclinical safety studies are key to identifying potential risks in order to make that decision about balance between risk and benefit before proceeding into the clinic. Application of the 3 R’s should be given more consideration with regard to the necessity of animal studies, the number of animals studied, or the study design itself. Performing studies in which more than one objective may be achieved can reduce the number of studies and number of animals studied overall.

AB  - Industry 4.0 has fueled research for almost a decade now. Beyond production efficiency, it has raised sustainability issues and societal challenges. However, these have mainly been driven by technological developments until now, putting aside the human and societal aspects. Faced with the emergence of paradigms such as Industry 5.0, it becomes clear that societal considerations are back on the technological and scientific stages. This paper is interested in the place that have been given to the human in last year’s industrial research. More specifically, the focus have been set on the human aspect into Industry 4.0’s main pillars: Cyber–Physical Systems and Internet of Things. Therefore, this work proposes a Systematic Literature Review on the subject. To apprehend the progress of research towards industrial systems as complex socio-technical ones, the retrieved literature has been analyzed through two frameworks: the enabling technologies for Industry 5.0 and the grounding concepts of systemics.

AB  - South Asian countries face a major threat concerning microplastics (MPs) contamination in food. This study explores the existing evidence of MPs in major foods of South Asian countries and links with available health risk indices through meta-analysis. Overall range of MPs in treated water, bottled water, fish, milk, salt, wheat, rice, and sugar were 0.75–35.33 particles L−1, 0.07–500 particles L−1, 0.006–361.6 particles g−1, 11.1–295.5 particles L−1, 0.01–350 particles g−1, 4.57 particles g−1, 0.303 particles g−1 and 0.343 particles g−1, respectively. Daily intake of MPs through food items was estimated with a range of 508–2280 particles person−1 day−1 depending on age group. Hazard score of MPs contaminated food indicates high to very high hazard scores in salt with an average PHI of 10,817.6 followed by fish (9012.9), milk (4900.4) and drinking water (3752.9) which are higher than the global values. High-risk polymers include Polyvinyl Chloride, Polyacrylamide, Styrene-Butadiene copolymer, Polyester, Polyurethane, and Polyamide. Average rate of microplastics ingestion ranged between 0.64 and 36.3 g person−1 year−1 with fish stand apex followed by bottled water, salt and milk. This study further investigates research gaps on MPs contamination in the foods of South Asian countries. Overall, the present study summarised the present level of MPs ingestion through different food sources in South Asian countries, highlighting the need for strong regulation to monitor level of MPs contamination in food.

AB  - This study conducts a systematic review of the scientific literature to understand the main trends related to wood waste reuse in the production of innovative and sustainable materials and products, in light of the Circular Economy approach and the Sustainable Development Goals. The main objective is to fill the existing gaps in the literature, outline possible future challenges, and initiate a new phase of experimentation on innovative bio-composite products. Using the Scopus database and applying the software VOSviewer and mySLR, a selected number of papers were analysed to identify trends and areas of interest in the management, valorisation, and reuse of wood waste in various industrial fields. The research mainly considers products that are both tested and in the experimental phase, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to waste management and proposing the adoption of strategies such as the "6R" principles (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, redesign, and regenerate). The bibliometric analysis, and a deep analysis of selected studies, revealed a growing interest in the use of wood waste in long-term applications, such as construction, bio-fuels, energy, and biocomposite materials, offering novel opportunities to promote sustainability, waste management, and reduce the environmental impact associated with this waste.

AB  - In the realm of data protection, a striking disconnect prevails between traditional domains of doctrinal, legal, theoretical, and policy-based inquiries and a burgeoning body of empirical evidence. Much of the scholarly and regulatory discourse remains entrenched in abstract legal principles or normative frameworks, leaving the empirical landscape uncharted or minimally engaged. Since the birth of EU data protection law, a modest body of empirical evidence has been generated but remains widely scattered and unexamined. Such evidence offers vital insights into the effectiveness of data protection measures but languishes on the periphery, inadequately integrated into the broader conversation. To make a meaningful connection, we conduct a comprehensive review and synthesis of empirical research spanning nearly three decades (1995 - March 2022), advocating for a more robust integration of empirical evidence into the evaluation and review of the GDPR while laying a methodological foundation for coordinated research. By categorising evidence into four distinct groups– Awareness and Trust, Operational Performance, Ripple Effect, and Normative Clarity, we provide a structured analysis therein and highlight the variety and nuances of the empirical evidence produced about the GDPR. Our discussion offers critical reflections on the current orientations and designs of evaluation work, challenging some popular but misguided orientations that significantly influence public debate and even direction of empirical and doctrinal research. This synthesis also sheds light on several understated aspects, surfaced by our systematic review, including the complex structure of the GDPR and the internal contradictions between components, the GDPR's interaction with other normative values and legal frameworks, as well as unintended consequences imposed by the GDPR on other values not explicitly recognised as regulatory objectives (such as innovation). We further propose a methodological improvement in how empirical evidence can be generated and utilised, stressing the need for more guided, coordinated and rigorous empirical research. By re-aligning empirical focus towards these ends and establishing strategic coordination at the community level, we seek to inform and underpin evaluative work that aligns empirical inquiries with policy and doctrinal needs, while truly reflecting the complexities and challenges of safeguarding personal data in the digital age.

AB  - Summary
Introduction
There are several reasons microsurgeons may not use a coupler device in arterial anastomosis: may be thick-walled, non-pliable due to atherosclerotic calcification or present vessel geometrical discrepancies. This review summarises the current applications, efficacy and troubleshooting of microvascular coupler devices in arterial end-to-end anastomosis.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature was performed in November 2020 across 4 electronic databases and in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All studies comprised the data synthesis that reported the use of a microvascular coupler device for arterial end-to-end anastomosis. Data were extracted and collected in three groups of standardised variables: study, anastomosis-related and technical characteristics.
Results
Out of the 7,690 articles identified, 20 were included in the final data synthesis. Included studies involved a total of 1639 patients, who underwent 670 arterial and 1,124 venous anastomoses. Out of all arterial anastomoses, 351 were performed in free tissue transfers in head and neck, 117 in breast, 4 in upper extremity and 5 in lower extremity reconstruction, whereas the remaining were not specified. The total arterial coupler anastomosis success rate reported was 92.1% (617/670). Fifty-three (8%) arterial anastomoses were reported to result in either troubleshooting events or intra- or post-operative failures, most being reported in extremity reconstructions.
Conclusions
Arterial coupling is not widespread with predominant use in head and neck and chest reconstructions, and total reported efficacy of 92.1%. Microsurgeons are reluctant to routinely use current widespread coupler devices as a result of inherent arterial characteristics. This study delivered collective recommendations, ‘do's and don'ts’ of microvascular arterial coupling.

Objective
To investigate the methodological quality of published systematic reviews of factors associated with COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
Method
Systematic review with registration protocol in PROSPERO, under the number CRD42020222418. Searches were carried out from October to November 2020 in the databases of the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, Embase and Cochrane Library, in addition to searching the reference list of the selected studies. Systematic review studies with or without meta-analysis and without date and language restrictions were included. Data were extracted in a standardized way and the quality of the studies was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews scale.
Results
Twelve reviews, published between 2020 and 2021, with a predominance of the English language, systematic reviews of observational studies with meta-analysis with a sample ranging from 6 to 83 studies, were included. Regarding financing, most of the study reported did not receive this type of support. Regarding to the assessment of the methodological quality of the studies, 3 were of moderate quality, 5 were classified as low quality and 3 with critically low quality.
Conclusions
The analyzed articles presented a bias in the preparation of reports on their studies, suggesting the need to use mechanisms to improve adherence to the established reporting guidelines and methodological evaluation tools.

AB  - In both the developed and developing world, cyber-violence presents a problem that affects most families and societies. However, there is a lack of diagnostic studies dedicated to this phenomenon, especially its factors and the relevant models. Consequently, the aim of this study was to extract the factors that bear upon cyber-violence by conducting a systematic literature review. This was anticipated to lead to a better understanding of those factors with their models and effects, as explored in previous research. This systematic literature review resulted in a comprehensive and rigorous examination of the relevant literature, which included numerous articles of interest. The findings indicate that most of the past research on cyber-violence has primarily looked at the factors affecting the behavioral intention to engage in the phenomenon, while very few studies have looked at its effects, especially in developing countries. The period from which the primary studies were collected was 2010-2024, using the ScienceDirect, IEEE Explorer, Springer, SAGE, Taylor and Francis, MDPI and Emerald Insight databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, resulting in 91 studies to be systematically reviewed. It emerged from this review that engagement in cyber-violence was predominantly due to a lack of cyber-violence models and a failure to consider the factors that potentially contribute to engagement in cyber-violence. Hence, these factors are identified in this paper, looking at the academic, economic and social impact of cyber-violence. The outcomes of this review could assist future researchers by providing a roadmap of institutional repositories and guidelines for recognizing the models and factors of cyber-violence, together with its effects.

AB  - Context:
An assurance case is a structured hierarchy of claims aiming at demonstrating that a mission-critical system supports specific requirements (e.g., safety, security, privacy). The presence of assurance weakeners (i.e., assurance deficits, logical fallacies) in assurance cases reflects insufficient evidence, knowledge, or gaps in reasoning. These weakeners can undermine confidence in assurance arguments, potentially hindering the verification of mission-critical system capabilities which could result in catastrophic outcomes (e.g., loss of lives). Given the growing interest in employing assurance cases to ensure that systems are developed to meet their requirements, exploring the management of assurance weakeners becomes beneficial.
Objective:
As a stepping stone for future research on assurance weakeners, we aim to initiate the first comprehensive systematic mapping study on this subject.
Methods:
We followed the well-established PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines to conduct our systematic mapping study. We searched for primary studies in five digital libraries and focused on the 2012–2023 publication year range. Our selection criteria focused on studies addressing assurance weakeners from a qualitative standpoint, resulting in the inclusion of 39 primary studies in our systematic review.
Results:
Our systematic mapping study reports a taxonomy (map) that provides a uniform categorization of assurance weakeners and approaches proposed to manage them from a qualitative perspective. The taxonomy classifies weakeners in four categories: aleatory, epistemic, ontological, and argument uncertainty. Additionally, it classifies approaches supporting the management of weakeners in three main categories: representation, identification and mitigation approaches.
Conclusion:
Our study findings suggest that the SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel) – a standard specified by the OMG (Object Management Group) – offers a comprehensive range of capabilities to capture structured arguments and reason about their potential assurance weakeners. Our findings also suggest novel assurance weakener management approaches should be proposed to better assure mission-critical systems.

The result shows that in the class of games we present, only a sparse cooperation structure is needed by the agents to achieve an outcome that is optimal in the sense of the utilitarian social welfare function. We show that neither full cooperation amongst players nor full information from a centralized controller is ever necessary to do so. We precisely characterize Shadow Monopolies, the nonzero-cooperation structures that equilibrate the optimal outcome, and we show that only the sparsest kind of Shadow Monopoly is ever needed.

AB  - Background
The concurrent assessment of weight and affective psychopathology outcomes relevant to the psychopharmacology of major eating disorders (EDs), namely anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), warrants systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov were inquired from inception through August 31st, 2022, for RCTs documenting any psychopharmacological intervention for EDs diagnosed according to validated criteria and reporting weight and psychopathology changes. Adopted keywords were: “anorexia nervosa,” “bulimia nervosa,” “binge eating disorder,” “antidepressant,” “antipsychotic,” and “mood stabilizer.” No language restriction applied.
Results
5122 records were identified, and 203 full-texts were reviewed. Sixty-two studies entered the qualitative synthesis (AN = 22, BN = 23, BED = 17), of which 22 entered the meta-analysis (AN = 9, BN = 10, BED = 3). Concerning BMI increase in AN, olanzapine outperformed placebo (Hedges'g = 0.283, 95%C·I. = 0.051–0.515, I2 = 0 %; p = .017), whereas fluoxetine failed (Hedges'g = 0.351, 95%C.I. = −0.248 to 0.95, I2 = 63.37 %; p = .251). Fluoxetine not significantly changed weight (Hedges'g = 0.147, 95%C.I. = −0.157–0.451, I2 = 0 %; p = .343), reducing binging (Hedges'g = 0.203, 95%C.I. = 0.007–0.399, I2 = 0 %; p = .042), and purging episodes (Hedges'g = 0.328, 95%C.I. = −0.061–0.717, I2 = 58.97 %; p = .099) in BN. Lisdexamfetamine reduced weight (Hedges'g = 0.259, 95%C.I. = 0.071–0.446, I2 = 0 %; p = .007) and binging (Hedges'g = 0.571, 95%C.I. = 0.282–0.860, I2 = 53.84 %; p < .001) in BED.
Limitations
Small sample size, short duration, and lack of reliable operational definitions affect most of the included sponsored RCTs.
Conclusions
The efficacy of different drugs varies across different EDs, warranting additional primary studies recording broad psychopathological and cardiometabolic outcomes besides weight, especially against established psychotherapy interventions.

AB  - Understanding the vegetation phenology offers significant benefits for agricultural management and biodiversity conservation. It also facilitates valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. Researchers can analyze long-term phenological records to assess shifts in plant lifecycle events which may indicate climate-driven alterations. Furthermore, the integration of remote sensing (RS) techniques and geographic information systems (GIS) enhances the ability to monitor and analyze phenological patterns at larger scales, supporting global environmental monitoring and decision-making processes. However, extracting meaningful insights from the massive volumes of satellite data possesses significant challenges and requires the use of strong computational algorithms, such as machine learning (ML) methods. In this chapter, we present a comprehensive overview of existing research through a literature review which encompasses the investigations conducted in the field of vegetation phenology and elucidates the utilization of satellite imaging and ML techniques.

AB  - Global optimization of complex and high-dimensional functions remains a central challenge with broad applications in science and engineering. This study introduces a new optimization approach called quasi-random metaheuristic based on fractal search (QRFS), which harnesses the power of fractal geometry, low discrepancy sequences, and intelligent search space partitioning techniques. The QRFS uses fractals’ inherent self-similarity and intricate structure to guide the solution space exploration. For the proposal, a deterministic but quasi-random element is used in the search process using low discrepancy sequences, such as Sobol, Halton, Hammersley, and Latin Hypercube. This integration allows the algorithm to systematically cover the search space while maintaining the level of diversity necessary for efficient exploration. The QRFS employs a dynamic strategy of partitioning the search space and reducing the population of solutions to optimize the use of function accesses, which causes it to adapt well to the characteristics of the problem. The algorithm intelligently identifies and prioritizes promising regions within the fractal-based representation, allocating computational resources where they are most likely to yield optimal solutions. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark problems demonstrate that QRFS consistently outperforms modern, canonical metaheuristics and variants of algorithms such as differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), covariance matrix adaptive evolution strategy (CMA-ES), regarding solution quality. Besides, the algorithm shows remarkable scalability, which makes it suitable for high-dimensional optimization tasks. Overall, QRFS offers a robust and efficient approach to solving complex optimization problems in various domains, paving the way for improved decision-making in real-world applications.

AB  - Drug binding and interactions with plasma proteins play a crucial role in determining the efficacy of drug delivery, thus significantly impacting the overall pharmacological effect. AGP, the second most abundant plasma protein in blood circulation, has the unique capability to bind drugs and transport various compounds. In our present study, for the first time, we investigated whether AGP, a major component of the acute phase lipocalin in human plasma, can bind with pentamidine derivatives known for their high activity against the fungal pathogen Pneumocystis carinii. This investigation was conducted using integrated spectroscopic techniques and computer-based approaches. According to the results, it was concluded that compounds having heteroatoms (-NCH3) in the aliphatic linker and the addition of a Br atom and a methoxy substituent at the C-2 and C-6 positions on the benzene ring, exhibit strong interactions with the AGP binding site. These compounds are identified as potential candidates for recognition by this protein. MD studies indicated that the tested analogues complexed with AGPs reach an equilibrium state after 60 ns, suggesting the stability of the complexes. This observation was further corroborated by experimental results. Therefore, exploring the interaction mechanism of pentamidine derivatives with plasma proteins holds promise for the development of bis-benzamidine-designed pharmaceutically important drugs.

AB  - Over and above technical skills, software development graduates need to also poses team-based skills, such as, leadership, oral communication and project management by the time they graduate from tertiary institutions. In order to fulfil this requirement, institutions introduced a project-based module, generally referred to as capstone, to be undertaken by students on the their final year. The essence of this module, amongst other things, is to expose students to the real-world professional experience through partnership with industry. Much research has been conducted on students software projects, but very little investigation has gone into understanding how students evaluate the success of their projects. In is in this light that this study was conducted. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed on empirical studies published between 2000 and 2022, to establish criteria used by students in evaluating software project success. The investigation led to the discovery of one (1) paper, which identified three most important success criteria used by students. However, this study identified some short-comings (eg students had to pretend to be employed graduates when evaluating the imaginary projects) with the approach used by the abovementioned research paper in determining the students’ success criteria. Beside the fact that there is only one study that was found that addresses the study’s phenomenon, the identified short-comings on the paper indicate that there is a need for empirical research studies on this matter.

KW  - Systematic Literature Review
AB  - The fast-growing demand for effective Industry 4.0-ready systems from academics and practitioners has required an assessment of the state-of-the-art research and implementations in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). This paper primarily carries out a systematic literature review of the pertinent fields to identify the promising research topics with high potentials for further investigations. In this paper, we adopt a bibliometric and network analysis to create insights that have not been captured before in this domain. It identifies the key institutions, authors and countries that have the highest impact on today’s MES solutions. The trending and pioneering technologies, having high potential to be used in the new generation of MESs, are highlighted for further examinations. We subsequently reviewed the recent surveys related to these technologies and outlined the research limitations, gaps and opportunities that are discussed in the reviewed literature. Inspired by Industry 4.0 maturity steps, five intelligence levels are defined to examine the Industry 4.0 compatibility of the MES models. Besides, this paper briefly reviews the well-known MES solutions and examines their functionalities and intelligence levels. The paper additionally discusses the gaps between the degree of progress in academic and industrial MES solutions and the challenges that impede the adoption of novel MESs by practitioners. Lastly, we propose a conceptual framework, called Intelligent MES (IMES), to illustrate what an industry 4.0-ready MES should contain.

AB  - Background
The surgical safety checklist is widely used to improve the quality of perioperative care. However, clinicians continue to debate the clinical effectiveness of this tool.
Methods
Prospective analysis of data from the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), an international observational study of elective in-patient surgery, accompanied by a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. The exposure was surgical safety checklist use. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. In the ISOS cohort, a multivariable multi-level generalized linear model was used to test associations. To further contextualise these findings, we included the results from the ISOS cohort in a meta-analysis. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.
Results
We included 44 814 patients from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in the ISOS analysis. There were 40 245 (89.8%) patients exposed to the checklist, whilst 7508 (16.8%) sustained ≥1 postoperative complications and 207 (0.5%) died before hospital discharge. Checklist exposure was associated with reduced mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.49 (0.32–0.77); P<0.01], but no difference in complication rates [OR 1.02 (0.88–1.19); P=0.75]. In a systematic review, we screened 3732 records and identified 11 eligible studies of 453 292 patients including the ISOS cohort. Checklist exposure was associated with both reduced postoperative mortality [OR 0.75 (0.62–0.92); P<0.01; I2=87%] and reduced complication rates [OR 0.73 (0.61–0.88); P<0.01; I2=89%).
Conclusions
Patients exposed to a surgical safety checklist experience better postoperative outcomes, but this could simply reflect wider quality of care in hospitals where checklist use is routine.

AB  - Background
With an increasing volume of research exploring the pathways linking greenspace exposure to mental health, there is a need to synthesise the strength of evidence on the mediation mechanisms. Synthesising the strength of evidence on the pathways can help us better understand how greenspace exposure affects mental health and guide future green space interventions to improve mental health.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to synthesise current evidence on the pathways linking objectively-measured greenspace exposure and mental health using a systematic review approach.
Methods
Literature searches were conducted in March 2020 from five common databases (i.e., MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) using search terms of green spaces and mental health. English language and human population were imposed as search limits. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed to synthesise and report results.
Results
The initial systematic searches yielded 16,415 records, of which 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Mixed or non-significant evidence was revealed for the mediating effects of air quality, physical activity, perceived stress, perceived restorativeness, residential noise, social cohesion, and social support on the pathways from greenspace exposure to mental illness. The effect of greenspace exposure on mental well-being was mediated by air quality, perceived stress, and physical activity. In addition, mixed evidence was revealed for the mediating role of social cohesion on the path from greenspace exposure to mental well-being.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlighted the key pathways linking green spaces to mental well-being via harmful mitigation, psychological restoration, and encouragement of health-related behaviours. Evidence for the pathway between greenspace exposure and mental illness is equivocal at present. Future research is recommended to adopt well-designed longitudinal and experimental studies to establish causal inferences on mental health benefits of greenspace exposure.

AB  - This article presents a meta-analysis of 40 studies conducted during the first two decades of the 21st Century that have analyzed the relationship between teacher characteristics and competencies and the academic performance of secondary school students, which contributed a total of 202 effects. The effect sizes were estimated using Fisher's transformation and a random-effects model was proposed to study the summary effect. The results show that teachers’ characteristics and competencies explain 9.2% of the differences in students’ performance. Although the overall effect can be considered as moderate, a closer examination of specific teacher characteristics and competencies revealed some larger effect sizes. This is the case of teachers’ reflective attitude, their professional development, and teaching self-efficacy.

La dispareunia se define como la presencia de dolor persistente o recurrente durante el acto sexual y se considera una de las principales disfunciones sexuales en el posparto. El objetivo de este trabajo es conocer los factores que influyen en la aparición de la dispareunia en el período posparto. En enero de 2018 se llevó a cabo una revisión bibliográfica en las siguientes bases de datos: Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science y Scopus. Se obtuvieron un total de 15 artículos tras aplicar los criterios de inclusión y exclusión. Se encontró que la dispareunia posparto tiene como principales factores de riesgo el tipo de parto (siendo mayor en las cesáreas y los partos instrumentales), el trauma perineal y/o la episiotomía y la lactancia materna. La situación psicosocial también puede repercutir en la aparición de esta dolencia.
Dyspareunia is defined as the presence of persistent or recurrent pain during sexual intercourse and is considered one of the main postpartum sexual dysfunctions. The aim of this study is to determine the factors that influence the appearance of dyspareunia in the postpartum period. A literature review was conducted in the following databases in January 2018: Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Scopus. A total of 15 articles were obtained after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main risk factors in postpartum dyspareunia are the type of delivery (being higher in caesarean sections and instrumental deliveries), perineal trauma and/or episiotomy, and breastfeeding. The psychosocial situation can also affect the appearance of this disorder.

Introducción
Se considera la reserva cognitiva (RC) como la optimización de los recursos cerebrales al emplear redes neuronales y estrategias cognitivas alternativas. Se piensa que la RC es una explicación plausible a un mecanismo potencial que permite al cerebro compensar deficiencias, ya sean causadas por el deterioro cerebral o por el declive funcional.
Objetivo
Analizar la información de la literatura científica acerca de los efectos de la RC sobre variables clínicas y cognitivas en pacientes con diversas enfermedades distintas a las demencias.
Desarrollo
Se realizó una búsqueda sistemática en las bases PubMed/Medline y ScienceDirect de artículos que evaluaran la influencia de la RC sobre variables clínicas y cognitivas en pacientes con enfermedades distintas a las demencias, incluyendo estudios empíricos con diseño longitudinal/transversal y observacional/cuasiexperimental. Se incluyeron 107 artículos.
Resultados
Mayores niveles de RC se relacionan con un menor deterioro cognitivo en una gran variedad de trastornos y con una mejor recuperación en pacientes con enfermedad neurológica, psiquiátrica, infecciosa, cáncer, etc. También hay evidencia sobre el papel de la RC como factor protector para el retraso en el desarrollo de enfermedades neurológicas, neuropsiquiátricas, infecciosas, etc.
Limitaciones
Podría existir más bibliografía, pues solo exploramos 2 bases.
Conclusión
Una aproximación a la RC podría estar constituida por un conjunto de variables (cognitivas, demográficas, físicas, etc.) que parecen influir de manera importante sobre aspectos cognitivos, clínicos y funcionales de diversas enfermedades. Se subraya la necesidad de investigar a profundidad el papel de la RC en el proceso de recuperación y como factor protector en diferentes dolencias.
Introduction
Cognitive reserve (CR) is considered as an optimisation of brain resources by using alternative neural networks and cognitive strategies. It is suggested that CR is a plausible explanation of a potential mechanism that allows the brain to compensate deficiencies caused either by brain damage or functional decline.
Objective
To analyse the information from scientific literature about the effects of CR on clinical and cognitive variables of patients affected by disorders other than dementia.
Development
A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline and ScienceDirect databases. A review was performed on articles that assessed the influence of CR in clinical and cognitive variables associated with disorders other than dementia. Empirical, longitudinal/transactional, and observational/quasi-experimental design studies were considered. The study finally included 107 research papers that fulfilled the established criteria.
Results
Higher CR levels were associated with lower cognitive impairment in a wide variety of disorders, as well as with a better recovery on neurological, psychiatric or infectious conditions. Moreover, there is evidence on the CR role as a protective factor that could delay the development of neurological, neuropsychiatric, or infectious disorders.
Limitations
As only 2 databases were searched, there may be more literature references on CR.
Conclusion
CR proxies constitute a set of variables (cognitive, demographic, physical, etc.) that may have a significant influence on cognitive, clinical and functional aspects of different disorders. The need to conduct more research about the role of CR in the recovery process and as a protective factor in different disorders is highlighted.

AB  - Objective
The objective of this meta-analysis was to study the diagnostic value of lung ultrasound (LUS) for transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN).
Methods
Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched, and the last search date was October 31, 2020. Studies on the diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary ultrasound for transient tachypnea were included. The quality assessment of the included study was assessed using the Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. A meta-analysis was performed using Meta-Disc 1.4. A random-effects model was used and subgroup analysis was carried out to identify possible sources of heterogeneity.
Results
A total of 378 articles were retrieved and nine studies with 3239 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. The overall quality of the included studies was moderate to high. The result of threshold analysis shows that there was no threshold effect. However, there was a significant heterogeneity caused by non-threshold effects in the included studies. A random-effects model was used. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR and NLR were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.51-0.58), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99), 58.30 (95% CI: 14.05-241.88) and 0.28 (95% CI: 0.18-0.43). The pooled DOR and AUC were 689.12 (95% CI: 68.71 to 6911.79) and 0.994. The results of subgroup analysis showed that the LUS diagnostic criteria and gold standard might be responsible for heterogeneity. Choosing "DLP combined with B line" as the diagnostic standard of LUS and choosing CXR as the gold standard could significantly improve the diagnostic performance of LUS.
Conclusion
LUS is a promising method to diagnose TTN. Only DLP is not enough to diagnose TTN, while DLP combined with B-line has good diagnostic performance.

AB  - Accomplishing multifunctional applications in modern concrete infrastructure requires structural components with excellent mechanical, durability, and smart qualities. Nanotechnology has been widely used in cement materials to improve structural qualities and solve the shortcomings of energy consumption, environmental protection, and poor toughness of conventional cement materials to meet these growing needs. Due to its outstanding mechanical characteristics and active functional groups, graphene oxide (GO), a typical sheet-like graphene derivate, has been experimentally demonstrated to significantly increase the strength and durability of concrete when used in very tiny dosages. This review covers the approaches that may be used to analyse the mechanical, durability, and microstructure performance of GO's reinforcement in cement composites. The scientific community may utilize this review to develop multifunctional concrete structures for the future construction industry and get fresh insights into nano-cement composites.

AB  - Virtual power plants (VPPs) have become an important technological means for large-scale distributed energy resources to participate in the operation of power systems and electricity markets. However, the operation of VPPs is challenged by stochastic resource characteristics, complex control features, heterogeneous information structures, and strategic game behaviors among stakeholders. To clarify the key problems and solutions to these challenges, this article describes the resource coordination problems and multidimensional interaction mechanism, and it elaborates the overall decision-making process of VPPs. It also discusses different specific operational stages that VPPs should attach importance to from three separate perspectives: energy, communication and the market. From each perspective, every section first analyzes the motivation of decision-making, then analyzes the complexity of the problem models, and summarizes the different modeling methods and solving techniques, thus completing a comprehensive review of VPP operation. Furthermore, the article adopts an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing a literature review and technical statistics to capture the multifaceted contributions of decision-making to VPP operations. It delves into the evolving trends of decision-making technology, analyzed from the coupling cyber-physical-social perspective. Finally, the future trajectory of research issues is deliberated.

AB  - Background
Cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy share clinical features with spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses. However, the exact immunopathogenesis of cirAEs remains unclear.
Objective
To investigate the inflammation that mediates the most common cirAEs, lichenoid eruption (LE) and eczematous eruption (EE).
Methods
In a prospective cohort study, participants with cancer on ICI therapy with any clinically visible cirAEs were enrolled. T helper-1 (Th1) and Th2 cell responses in cirAEs were compared to spontaneous lichenoid dermatitis (LD) and eczematous dermatitis (ED).
Results
Among 88 cirAE biopsies collected, LE (35.22%) and EE (31.81%) accounted for most cases. In contrast to LD, we found that the CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and Th2/Th1 ratios were increased in ICI-induced LE, similar to EE. Importantly, we identified several cirAEs displaying a combination of LE and EE on pathology.
Limitations
Only the most common types of cirAEs were evaluated, and Th17 cells were not analyzed.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that LE and EE may represent a cirAE spectrum with a common underlying immunologic mechanism. Thus, understanding the immunopathogenesis of cirAEs can aid in their treatment and prevention.

AB  - Summary
Here, we report a high-performance catalyst Cu@Na-Beta, prepared via a unique method to embed 2∼5 nm Cu nanoparticles in crystalline particles of Na-Beta zeolite, for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol as the only organic product in a traditional fixed-bed reactor. The ethanol yield in a single pass can reach ∼14% at 300°C, ∼12,000 mL·gcat−1·h−1, and 2.1 MPa, corresponding to a space-time yield of ∼398 mg·gcat−1·h−1. The key step of the reaction is considered as the rapid bonding of CO2∗ with surface methyl species at step sites of Cu nanoparticles to CH3COO∗ that converts to ethanol in following hydrogenation steps. The points of the catalyst seemed to be that the irregular copper nanoparticles stuck in zeolitic frameworks offer high density of step sites and the intimate surrounding of zeolitic frameworks strongly constrain the CO2 reactions at the copper surface and block by-products, such as methanol, formic acid, and acetyl acid.

AB  - Green innovation (GI) has attracted growing interest in academia, society and business due to its importance for environmental protection, quality of life, environmentally friendly products and economic results, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Consequently, given the vast literature, a bibliometric analysis of GI in SMEs is presented to evaluate their conceptual structure using Scopus and Web of Science databases through performance and bibliometric mapping with VOSviewer and R software. The results show that this topic is a growing area of research, with 496 articles developed by 1373 authors, 218 journals and 63 countries. The structure shows that the main research topics relate to sustainable business development, green business transformation, sustainable business innovation and performance, sustainable production, barriers, drivers and outcomes, eco-innovation and sustainability, and innovation and knowledge management. This work offers updated and exhaustive information on advances in this field that serve as a guide for SMEs to make informed decisions about innovation strategies, as well as more effective practices and lessons learned from other similar companies. In turn, governments can take these results and design policies and programs to support GI. Finally, this article highlights gaps in the literature that suggest possible avenues for follow-up studies.

AB  - Purpose
This paper reviews the field of internal auditing (IA) post-Enron to develop insights into how IA research has developed, offer a critique of the research to date and identify ways that future research can help to advance IA.
Design/methodology/approach
A structured literature review (SLR) was used to analyse 471 papers from 64 journals published between 2005 and 2018 based on a number of criteria, namely author, journal type, journal location, year, theme, theory, nature of research, research setting, regional focus, method and citations.
Findings
The IA literature has not significantly contributed to knowledge of the internal audit function (IAF), and one still knows relatively little about the factors that contribute to making the impact of IA practice effective and measurable. The IA literature is US-dominated (authors and journals), focussed on the American context (publicly listed companies), reliant on positivist analyses and largely makes no explicit reference to theory. Central regions (emerging economies) and key organisational settings (private SMEs and not-for-profit organisations) are largely absent in prior IA research. This paper evaluates and identifies avenues through which future research can help to advance IA in order to address emerging challenges in the field.
Originality/value
This is the first comprehensive review to analyse IA research in the post-Enron period (2005–2018). The findings are relevant to researchers who are looking for appropriate research outlets and emerging scholars who wish to identify their own research directions.

AB  - Across the world, planning and decision-making for urban forests increasingly seeks to include diverse perspectives. Yet, research on people’s perceptions of urban forests and urban trees is fragmented. To integrate and critically analyse this body of research, we conducted a review of empirical studies about people’s perceptions of urban forests and urban trees. We analysed 178 relevant studies with a focus on the diversity of places, methods, people, and perception response, using text analysis algorithms in Leximancer and established epistemological and methodological content assessment frameworks. The mixed-methods-assessment-tool (MMAT) was also used to assess method quality. Findings show current literature inadequately considers diversity of places, methods, people, and perception responses. Although multiple countries are represented, studies are usually limited to a single city and address perceptions of urban trees generally or trees in parks. Convenience sampling dominates, through predetermined, survey- and intercept-based data collection techniques. Few studies have investigated the perceptions of demographically, ethnically, or culturally diverse people. Most studies focused on the positive perceptions people hold (i.e., perceptions of benefits; beliefs about the positive consequences of urban trees), rather than the diversity of perceptions that may exist. The exception is studies that focused on values, which do report more diverse perception responses. Studies often lack conceptual clarity about the specific type of perception response being investigated. Future research must consider what is being perceived, how is it being perceived, and who is perceiving it, with more clarity. There should be more emphasis on incorporating diversity in study design to better inform urban forest sustainability and resilience.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) induce corporates to re-design their innovation process. Due to rapid technological development, synchronization of information systems, and industrialization, corporate managers increasingly adopt AI in innovation. In response, scholars are interested in the idea of creating and mapping the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, which resulted in massive literature during the past decades. To critically analyze the phenomena of AI in corporate innovation, we conducted a hybrid review of published literature (364 articles) for the last 56 years (1996 to July 2022). We present taxonomy, outline AI phases, AI large scope definition, and link with innovation. We identify eight focal fields in the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, such as AI and business models (BM), AI and product innovation, AI and open innovation, AI and innovation process, AI and firm's innovation structure, AI, firm's knowledge and innovation, and AI, innovation and firm market performance, and AI and innovativeness of supply chain management. We outline a framework encompassing the role of AI in corporate innovation. We conclude this study by identifying influential aspects of literature and presenting future research agendas.

AB  - In the last ten years, it was observed that the continuous upgrades in mobile device’s technology have increased and demonstrated their great potential in various learning environments. Besides, it has motivated researchers to apply more innovative computational techniques regarding context-aware and a set of variables that have been used at different virtual learning proposals. This paper presents a Systematic Mapping Review that focuses on context-aware analysis and its approach to learning processes in mobile learning (m-learning) and ubiquitous learning (u-learning). Furthermore, the study identifies variables that have been used in the past decade for context-awareness analytics and that have been applied to those learning processes. Especially at systems’ adaptations to learning styles and student-specific characteristics. A methodological process was applied to address problems through identification, critical evaluation, and integration of the most relevant works, where high-quality individual studies address one or several research questions. Results show that external variables, including location, time, and software, are the most used variables in the context-aware analysis, with 52.25% prevalence in research papers. Internal variables, including personal information, learning styles, and teaching styles, had a prevalence of 33.33%; variables less frequently used in the research included socioeconomic information and emotional content. The remaining 14.41% represents academic activities. These findings provide a basis for future research and development in the field of m-learning.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa has been hailed as a rising star with respect to the adoption of renewable energy technologies, including solar home systems (SHSs). So, how do forms of social difference shape the adoption of SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa? To address this question, this study conducts a systematic review of the academic literature on SHSs in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings indicate that gender intersects with age, geographical location, and other inequalities to shape the adoption of SHSs. The adoption of SHSs may reproduce the structures that determine power and resource allocation at the local level. Because of various factors, including decision-making power, control over resources, gendered division of labour, and gendered domestic space, the uptake of SHSs has implications for how and when women perform household chores. From a Weberian perspective, the adoption of SHSs in several communities in sub-Saharan Africa is also grounded in class-based and status-based explanations. SHSs are powerful forces for the reproduction of power relations as well as vehicles for the reconfiguration of social hierarchies. Culture is a double-edged sword that both fosters the adoption of SHSs and hinders that adoption. Based on our analysis, we suggest opportunities for future research.

AB  - The quest for effective treatments of oxidative stress has concentrated over the years on new nanomaterials with improved antioxidant and antiradical activity, thereby attracting broad research interest. In that regard, research efforts in our lab were launched to pursue such hybrid materials involving a) synthesis of silica gel matrices, b) evaluation of the suitability of atoxic matrices as potential carriers for the controlled release of V(IV)(VOSO4), V(V)(NaVO3) compounds and a newly synthesized heterometallic lithium-vanadium(IV,V) tetranuclear compound containing vanadium-bound hydroxycarboxylic 1,3-diamine-2-propanol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (DPOT), and c) investigation of structural and textural properties of silica nanoparticles (NPs) by different and complementary characterization techniques, inquiring into the nature of the encapsulated vanadium species and their interaction with the siloxane matrix, collectively targeting novel antioxidant and antiradical nanomaterials biotechnology. The physicochemical characterization of the vanadium-loaded SiO2 NPs led to the formulation of optimized material configuration linked to the delivery of the encapsulated antioxidant-antiradical load. Entrapment and drug release studies showed a) the competence of hybrid nanoparticles with respect to encapsulation efficiency of the vanadium compound (concentration dependence), b) congruence with the physicochemical features determined, and c) a well-defined release profile of NP load. Antioxidant properties and the free radical scavenging capacity of the new hybrid materials (containing VOSO4, NaVO3, and V-DPOT) were demonstrated through a) 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, and b) intracellular-extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, through UV–Visible spectroscopy techniques, collectively showing that the hybrid silica NPs (empty-loaded) could serve as an efficient platform for nanodrug formulations counteracting oxidative stress.

AB  - Background
Exposure to seasonal environmental factors during gestation or early in the postnatal period could influence the development of autoimmunity, determining a seasonality in the month of birth (MOB). There are studies evaluating this potential seasonality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), and Addison's disease (ADD), but results have been controversial.
Methods
Systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines, using PubMed, Web of Science and WorldCat databases (2005–2020) of studies that explored the association between the seasonality of the MOB and T1D, AITD and ADD. Information on sex and age, location, methodology and internal quality, seasonal patterns, hypotheses and other factors proposed to explain seasonality were extracted. Differences in season and month of birth were further discussed.
Results
The initial search retrieved 300 articles, and after further screening, 11 articles fulfilled inclusion criteria and were finally selected and reviewed. 73% found a seasonal pattern and 64% showed birth peaks in spring and/or summer. Hashimoto's thyroiditis and women exhibited a higher seasonality. Ultraviolet radiation, Vitamin D levels and viral infections were identified as influencing factors.
Conclusions
The effect of certain seasonal factors during foetal development, reflected by the seasonal differences in the MOB, could contribute to the development of endocrine autoimmune diseases in predisposed patients. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed seasonality.
Resumen
Introducción
La exposición a factores ambientales durante la gestación o el periodo neonatal precoz puede condicionar el desarrollo de autoinmunidad, determinando una estacionalidad en el mes de nacimiento (MDN). Existen estudios que evalúan la potencial estacionalidad en pacientes con diabetes tipo 1 (DM1), enfermedad tiroidea autoinmune (ETAI) y enfermedad de Addison (ADD), con resultados controvertidos.
Material y métodos
Revisión sistemática, siguiendo las directrices PRISMA en los buscadores PubMed, Web of Science y WorldCat (2005-2020), de los estudios que exploran la asociación entre la estacionalidad del MDN y el desarrollo de DM1, ETAI y ADD. Se recogió información relativa al sexo, edad, localización geográfica, metodología, calidad, patrón estacional, hipótesis y otros factores potencialmente asociados.
Resultados
Tras una primera selección de 300 artículos, se incluyeron finalmente 11 que cumplían los criterios de inclusión. En el 73% se encontró un patrón estacional y en el 64% se encontró un pico de nacimientos en primavera y/o verano. La estacionalidad fue más evidente para la tiroiditis de Hashimoto y las mujeres. La radiación ultravioleta, vitamina D y las infecciones virales se identificaron como factores influyentes.
Conclusión
El efecto de algunos factores estacionales durante el desarrollo fetal, reflejo de las diferencias estacionales en el MDN, puede contribuir al desarrollo de enfermedades endocrinas autoinmunes en individuos predispuestos. Se necesitan más estudios para dilucidar los mecanismos subyacentes que expliquen dicha estacionalidad.

AB  - Contemporary manufacturing must prioritise the sustainability of its manufacturing processes and systems. Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) focusses on minimising waste of any kind using data-driven technology, hence enhancing the quality of all manufacturing aspects (product, process, service, etc.). Making things right on the first try is the central tenet of ZDM. In recent years, the application of automation for in-line quality inspection systems has begun to attract the interest of both practitioners and academics because of its capability to detect defects in real-time, and thus adapt the system to disturbances. In this work, we provide a systematic review of the literature on current trends in the application of automation for in-line quality inspection with the ultimate objective of achieving ZDM. Additionally, bibliometric and performance analyses have been performed to gain a complete picture of the field. In this work, we have collected bibliometric data from the most widely referred search engines for academic engineering papers, i.e. Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Explorer, involving a total of 145 academic publications from 2011 to 2021. Uniquely for this study, we used three research attributes for the analysis of the selected articles, that is, the level of automation, the condition for quality inspection, and the contribution to ZDM dimensions. The literature suggests that there is a lack of research on the use of in-line detection data for the prediction of defects or repair. Based on the results and our interpretation of the literature, an adapted framework of ZDM (Psarommatis et al., 2020a) and multi-layer quality inspection (Azamfirei et al., 2021a) is presented.
