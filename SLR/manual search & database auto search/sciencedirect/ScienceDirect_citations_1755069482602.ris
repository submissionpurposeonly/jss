AB  - Cellulose nanomaterials (CNs) are valuable, emerging green materials distinguished by their exceptional properties and a broad spectrum of potential applications in traditional and innovative fields. These nanomaterials exhibit high mechanical strength, a high aspect ratio, transparency, and a highly reactive chemical surface area. Additionally, they are biodegradable and produced from cellulose, an abundant and renewable resource. Such attributes position CNs as promising candidates in the rapidly growing sector of sustainable materials. However, like other nanomaterials in the developmental stage, the production, use, and end-of-life (EoL) management of these materials raise environmental, economic, and social concerns that need addressing. Emphasizing ecodesign and sustainable processes is crucial, particularly because the technologies for producing CNs are predominantly in the early to intermediate stages of technological maturity, as indicated by their low Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). Recognizing these challenges, this tutorial review aims to analyze the life cycle and environmental implications of CNs to enhance their ecodesign, an increasingly critical aspect of these emerging materials. To achieve this, a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed literature on the production processes and life cycle assessments (LCA) of CNs was conducted. This review systematically and thoroughly evaluates the environmental effects associated with various raw materials, processes, and applications from a life cycle perspective. By highlighting how methodological decisions can influence LCA outcomes, the review pinpoints critical impact areas and evaluates the environmental performance of CNs compared to alternative materials. Additionally, the review brings to light the main challenges, and identifies opportunities within LCA studies on CNs. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis was utilized to gather insights into the significance of integrating LCA in CN research for informed decision-making. This analysis has identified research opportunities, particularly in multi-product processes, multiple CN-based products, consequential modeling, and their end-of-life considerations. Future challenges include the need for primary company data, toxicity data for LCA, prospective LCA, and a multidisciplinary team with LCA expertise to address these issues. Drawing from the SWOT analysis, this review suggests a strategic framework to guide future LCA research on CNs, intending to improve their eco-friendly design and support the worldwide bioeconomy.

AB  - Background
Mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC) has a unique origin and structure, responding to biomechanical and molecular cues influenced by functional appliance therapy (FAT), sex, and age. This scoping review aimed to map related biomolecular signatures, with a secondary goal of developing a stage-specific, evidence-based model of MCC growth.
Methods
Literature search was conducted with a predefined search strategy in major databases, references, and hand-search in November 2024. A total of 130 studies related to MCC which met the strict inclusion criteria according to the PRISMA guidelines were finally included in the review. Bioinformatic analysis identified gene-disease associations, functional enrichment, hub genes, and protein-protein interactions based on the included studies.
Results
Studies documented biomarkers in condylar growth, varying with age, sex, and FAT activation. Genes; Sox9, insulin growth factor (IGF)-I/IGF-II, articulated early chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. Early extracellular matrix (ECM) modeling involved some matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and gene expression. Chondrocyte maturation was mediated by Runx2, Osterix genes, while neovascularization and osteogenic differentiation was mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other key regulators. Micro(mi)-RNAs were also involved to promote osteogenic differentiation and chondrocyte differentiation. Bioinformatics identified 20 hub genes, implicating ECM organization, and hormone-mediated signaling, with additional key nodes.
Conclusions
The identification of biomolecular signatures and signaling pathways responsible for MCC growth and remodeling may benefit orthodontists in FAT diagnostics, and temporomandibular joint research.

AB  - Background: MRI is essential for diagnosing and monitoring Multiple Sclerosis. Emerging imaging biomarkers for disease progression often rely on non-conventional MRI sequences and complex post-processing tools, which are not typically available in routine clinical practice. Aim: To provide radiologists and neurologists worldwide with simplified MRI measurements for MS follow-up, obtained from conventional MRI sequences, to assist in predicting disability outcomes in people with MS. Methods: We conducted a scoping review covering five different online databases [PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core collection, Cochrane library CENTRAL and Scopus] resulting in 10916 results. Relevant full-text publications were selected after abstract and full-text reviews. This review followed the PRISMA-Scr guidelines. Data extraction was carried out by the two reviewers using a standardized predefined form. Results: Thirty-nine papers were included, identifying thirty-five manual measurements of brain and six of spinal cord. The third ventricle width (TVW) and corpus callosum area (CCA) were the most studied, with validation against their volumetric counterparts. Conclusions: Simplified MRI measurements, such as TVW and CCA, could be easily captured, enabling radiologists to assess the neurodegenerative component of MS in real-time, without relying on non-conventional imaging techniques or post-processing tools.

AB  - Research on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies in the HRM domain has attracted significant scholarly attention. Yet, few studies have consolidated key trends in adopting AI for HRM, especially on managerial competencies required for adopting AI-based technologies and identifying the key research directions for HR managers, including the development of an AI-focused competency framework for HR managers. A systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliometrics analysis were conducted to identify the current research direction for managers adopting AI in HRM. Several themes of managerial capabilities required for adopting AI in HRM were identified, utilizing the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV). The SLR identified applications of various AI tools and techniques in HR functions, recruitment and selection was one with the broadest use of AI applications. Managerial cognitive capability, managerial human capital, and managerial social capital of DCV were considered the initial coding categories under which various managerial competencies are required for the adoption of AI in HRM. This study utilized SLR, Bibliometric, and directed content analysis as three distinct but interrelated sets of methodologies for extracting novel insights into the adoption of AI for HRM. It highlights the associated managerial capabilities that need mapping for its adoption.

AB  - Objective
This scoping review aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the functions, design, implementation strategies, and evaluation approaches of mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) developed for older adults with cancer, to inform future research and practice.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework, with an updated systematic search of five databases (Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) from January 1, 2008, to February 28, 2025. The review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for scoping reviews.
Results
Thirty studies involving 19 mHealth apps were included. Primary functions encompassed health monitoring, education, symptom reminders, consultation, and personalized interventions. While most apps incorporated user-centered designs, the integration of theoretical frameworks and age-specific evaluation tools was limited. Implementation strategies varied, emphasizing user training, technical support, and family engagement. Social support features were underrepresented. Studies were predominantly conducted in Western countries, highlighting the need for culturally adapted interventions in East Asia.
Conclusions
This scoping review revealed that while mHealth apps for older adults with cancer have advanced in user-centered design and preliminary evaluations, critical gaps remain in theory-driven development, standardized usability assessment, and cultural adaptation. Future work should prioritize co-design, theoretical frameworks, and culturally sensitive strategies to enhance app usability and clinical integration.

AB  - Understanding the balance between structure and flexibility in innovation networks is critical for optimizing collaboration, adaptability, and innovation outcomes in increasingly complex ecosystems. This study conducts an integrative literature review of 136 peer-reviewed articles from Scopus and Web of Science to systematically examine the distinguishing characteristics, challenges, and indicators of formality within formal and informal innovation networks. Formal networks are defined by hierarchical structures, contractual governance, and regulated communication channels, while informal networks thrive on trust-based relationships, spontaneous interactions, and social capital. Despite their differences, both types frequently intersect, shaping innovation performance in complementary ways. Guided by three research questions, this study identifies (RQ1a) the key characteristics, (RQ1b) the management challenges, and (RQ2) a set of measurable indicators of network formality. Findings are synthesized into a conceptual framework that categorizes formality across four dimensions: structural features, interaction patterns, purpose alignment, and control mechanisms. This framework offers both theoretical advancement and practical insights for managing innovation networks, highlighting how different degrees of formality influence knowledge sharing, governance, and adaptability. By addressing critical gaps in the literature—such as the dynamic evolution of networks, the impact of digital technologies, and the emergence of hybrid forms—this study provides a structured foundation for future empirical research and supports organizations in designing balanced innovation strategies that integrate the strengths of both formal and informal networks.

AB  - Technological change presents significant challenges for organizations and society and needs to be understood from a socio-technical perspective. Technology and Innovation Management (TIM) can play a crucial role in understanding disruptive change. Smart farming technologies (SFTs) are used as prime examples for disruption in a traditional industry. This paper shows how scholars can use TIM theories to contribute to a better understanding and subsequent recommendations for action. We review 973 articles using bibliographic coupling to synthesize existing literature. We identify the most prominent research themes and problematize the existing narratives in light of three theoretical approaches to technological change: evolutionary economics, social construction of technology, and actor-network theory. Finally, we present theory-driven questions for future research that indicate new directions for TIM. We comprehensively review and synthesize existing research at the intersection of smart farming technologies and the TIM domain, using bibliographic coupling to identify prominent research themes, highlight blind spots, and generate questions for future research. To counter the common shortcomings of systematic literature reviews in general (Alvesson and Sandberg, 2020) and trending automated literature reviews, we supplement our analysis with an extensive explorative-qualitative discussion of the results, linking our findings back to theory and deriving a comprehensive set of research questions for future research. We build upon Bruun and Hukkinens’ (2003) Integrative Framework for Studying Technological Change to guide our discussion and expand our critical review. Thus, we make three main contributions. First, we give a curated and comprehensive overview of articles on SFT and technological change to identify the theoretical deficiencies that lead to oversimplified assumptions regarding the dissemination of smart farming technologies. Second, we enrich the TIM literature by applying three established theories of technological change in a particular sector, making the connection between a specific domain of technological application (SFT) and established theories in the technology and innovation management field. Third, by detailing the extent to which the three theories help us understand the existing literature and discussing it in its entire complexity, we identify several blind spots of current research and derive research questions for future research in both, the SFT and the TIM field. This approach opposes a technology-deterministic and simplistic view of technological developments. By doing so, we aim to inspire TIM scholars to use theories that sharpen their understanding of the socio-technical system and the complexity of technological change. The article is structured as follows: we present the current state of smart farming adoption and diffusion, introduce the theoretical framework, describe the methodology employed for our bibliographic analysis, present the main results, discuss the identified research themes, and conclude with a summary and questions for future research.

AB  - Grassland degradation presents overwhelming challenges to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the socio-economic sustainability of dependent communities. However, a comprehensive synthesis of global knowledge on the frontiers and key areas of grassland degradation research has not been achieved due to the limitations of traditional scientometrics methods. The present synthesis of information employed BERTopic, an advanced natural language processing tool, to analyze the extensive ecological literature on grassland degradation. We compiled a dataset of 4,504 publications from the Web of Science core collection database and used it to evaluate the geographic distribution and temporal evolution of different grassland types and available knowledge on the subject. Our analysis identified key topics in the global grassland degradation research domain, including the effects of grassland degradation on ecosystem functions, grassland ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation, erosion processes and hydrological models in grasslands, and others. The BERTopic analysis significantly outperforms traditional methods in identifying complex and evolving topics in large datasets of literature. Compared to traditional scientometrics analysis, BERTopic provides a more comprehensive perspective on the research areas, revealing not only popular topics but also emerging research areas that traditional methods may overlook, although scientometrics offers more specificity and detail. Therefore, we argue for the simultaneous use of both approaches to achieve more systematic and comprehensive assessments of specific research areas. This study represents an emerging application of BERTopic algorithms in ecological research, particularly in the critical research focused on global grassland degradation. It also highlights the need for integrating advanced computational methods in ecological research in this era of data explosion. Tools like the BERTopic algorithm are essential for enhancing our understanding of complex environmental problems, and it marks an important stride towards more sophisticated, data-driven analysis in ecology.

AB  - The understanding of building energy consumption and urban microclimates has been integrated into the concept of energy microclimates. Compared to individual simulations, coupled simulations of Building Energy Modeling (BEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offer higher accuracy, making them a focus of current energy microclimate research. However, previous reviews have often focused on coupling from a single perspective, neglecting the user-oriented aspect of coupled models as tools. A more comprehensive framework for coupled BEM and CFD simulations is needed to guide designers, engineers, and researchers in selecting appropriate models from an application perspective. Based on an urban multi-scale perspective, this paper adopts a hybrid review approach to comprehensively reviewed 67 types of BEM and CFD coupled models, data exchange protocols and implementation methods, coupling strategies, types of coupled data exchange based on research problems, and coupling accuracy. The focus was on the three factors influencing the choice of coupled models: the nature of the research problem, available computational time and resources, and the required level of accuracy. Results showed that EnergyPlus and Ansys Fluent were the preferred coupled models due to their versatility, particularly in micro-scale simulations. External coupling strategies were favored for their extensibility, while Quasi-dynamic coupling strategies could balance accuracy and speed. Air temperature, wind speed, and heat transfer coefficients are critical boundary conditions regarding data exchange and validation.

AB  - A/B testing, also referred to as online controlled experimentation or continuous experimentation, is a form of hypothesis testing where two variants of a piece of software are compared in the field from an end user’s point of view. A/B testing is widely used in practice to enable data-driven decision making for software development. While a few studies have explored different facets of research on A/B testing, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the state-of-the-art in A/B testing. Such a study is crucial to provide a systematic overview of the field of A/B testing driving future research forward. To address this gap and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in A/B testing, this paper reports the results of a systematic literature review that analyzed primary studies. The research questions focused on the subject of A/B testing, how A/B tests are designed and executed, what roles stakeholders have in this process, and the open challenges in the area. Analysis of the extracted data shows that the main targets of A/B testing are algorithms, visual elements, and workflow and processes. Single classic A/B tests are the dominating type of tests, primarily based in hypothesis tests. Stakeholders have three main roles in the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup technician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B tests are product/system data, user-centric data, and spatio-temporal data. The dominating use of the test results are feature selection, feature rollout, continued feature development, and subsequent A/B test design. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution: experiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems are related to the enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. From our study we derived three interesting lines for future research: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in A/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation of A/B testing.

AB  - The use of data analytics, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), has significantly transformed decision-making in healthcare. However, academic scholarship has expressed concerns over the misalignment of research priorities and their impact on data usage and choice of analytics. On the one hand, an inadequate understanding of healthcare themes and algorithmic nuances has posed difficulty for healthcare professionals to evaluate AI solutions and understand their generalizability and potential biases. On the other hand, the abundance of analytical tools, their complexity, and a misalignment between data type and analysis methods have presented major challenges for analysts in selecting a suitable method. As a result, healthcare research has mostly developed in silos. We propose a techno-functional framework that combines the perspectives of analysts and healthcare professionals, identifies key research themes (i.e., healthcare delivery, patient engagement, data management, market design, and policy and governance), and presents critical research questions that can guide future studies. We also propose a schema for segmenting analysis techniques based on data type and analytical complexity. This schema may help analysts select a suitable analysis technique and data to solve a specific problem. Our study aims to improve the understanding of healthcare analytics among researchers, analysts, and healthcare professionals and present a roadmap for future research.

AB  - Video gaming has historically been regarded as a pastime with addictive potential and has subsequently been the subject of public scrutiny, in media and academia. In the early 2000s, massively multiplayer online games (MMO) in particular were the locus of addiction-centred debates. However, over time different avenues of research into the outcomes of MMOs have opened up, honing in on social and psychological consequences. The present systematic literature review organises and examines research on the social impact of playing MMOs on their players, analysing a sample of 22 studies leaning on the PRISMA framework. The results indicate that a number of facets adhering to MMO gameplay, such as collective play, game involvement and being part of a community are beneficial to an individual's social capital and related concepts, while gaming time was a significant negative predictor. Offline social capital and leadership research were scarcely present in the collected studies, however the results imply a positive relation between MMO gameplay and these variables. Overall, the results suggest a high potential for transferability of social capital, even so there seems to be diminishing returns. Beyond a certain threshold of gaming time, the relation becomes negative, indicating the importance of balanced engagement.

AB  - Accurate, fast, and non-intrusive Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) estimations of existing buildings are crucial for informed decision-making in retrofit projects. A systematic integrative literature review was conducted following the PRISMA standard (1997–2024). This is the first review with statistical and critical thematic analysis on this topic, synthesizing a theoretical framework for future research directions. The review identified 63 relevant sources. Quantitative analysis reveals exponential growth of publications since 2017 on ML for HTC estimation, with leadership from China, USA and India. Qualitative analysis assessed existing ML methodologies, data collection protocols, and validation frameworks. Indoor and outdoor temperatures emerge as the most frequently used parameters; 45 % of studies use hourly measurement intervals. High-frequency data collection offers superior capture of thermal dynamics but poses challenges in data storage and processing. Neural network-based approaches (particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) dominate to capture non-linear thermal relationships. Key challenges include data quality requirements, computational efficiency, and the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability. A concerning finding shows 25.7 % of studies lack validation against established methods, highlighting a critical gap in standardization. This analysis provides insights into current methodological trends, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions for advancing ML applications in this field. Findings emphasize the need for standardized validation protocols, improved data collection strategies, and integrated approaches connecting component-level and whole-building analyses.

AB  - We present a systematic review of methods used to estimate Dynamic Treatment Regimens (DTR) using observational healthcare data and provide a brief summary of their strengths and weaknesses, evaluation metrics, and suitable research problem settings. We considered all observational studies identified in PubMed or EMBASE between January 1950 until January 2022, including only studies that evaluated medical treatments or interventions as exposure and/or outcome in patients and where DTRs were estimated. 83 studies met our inclusion criteria; 44.6% estimating DTR utilizing reinforcement learning, 18.1% utilizing counterfactual-based models, 12.1% utilizing classification-based methods, and 9.6% utilized g-methods. Among the studies analyzed, 28.9% aimed to replicate human expert DTRs, while 71.1% aimed to refine and improve existing DTRs. Approximately two-thirds of studies (65.1%) reported the assumptions required for their applied methods, such as exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and Markov property. Most of the studies (83.1%) estimated DTRs with more than two treatment options; 50.6% mentioned time-varying confounders, only a few estimated conditional average treatment effects (7.2%). Most (85.5%) validated their methods, with 32.5% using expected outcomes (e.g., survival rates), 26.5% employing simulated data, and 25.3% conducting direct comparisons with observational data.

AB  - Background
Skin injuries like superficial burns and skin graft donor sites are currently managed using various dressings. Frequent challenges include discomfort and trauma during dressing changes, suboptimal healing and significant scarring. Silk dressings show promise by reducing the need for frequent changes, allowing wound evaluation due to its transparency, exerting antibacterial properties, and minimizing scarring. However, silk is not yet widely adopted in clinical settings.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted. A search through 3 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed. Only RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies and case series were included. Appropriate quality tests were performed.
Results
1373 search results were identified. After deduplication, 979 were screened by title and abstract, of which 20 full-text articles remained and ultimately, 9 articles were included. Parameters examined were: healing duration, pain, subjective and objective skin measurements, adverse events, infection rates, transparency and price.
Conclusion
Silk dressings demonstrate comparable efficacy to existing dressings concerning transparency, healing time, pain, erythema, pigmentation, water loss normalization, firmness, visco-elasticity recovery, microcirculation, adverse events and infection rates. They are an economically interesting alternative for managing superficial partial-thickness skin burns and skin graft donor sites. Nonetheless, larger high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) involves estimating the salience of information and creating coherent summaries that include all relevant and important information from the original text. Extensive research has been carried out on ATS since 1958, gradually evolving from simple to advanced techniques, including machine learning-based, neural network-based, and deep learning-based techniques. Progress has been made in both extractive and abstractive methods throughout this development. Despite numerous surveys on ATS, there remains a notable absence of a comprehensive literature review encompassing the latest advancements in deep learning techniques for text summarization. Therefore, this paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of deep learning-based text summarization in both types (extractive and abstractive) between 2014 and 2023. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR that offers a comprehensive overview of extractive and abstractive text summarization techniques based on Deep Learning models. According to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 73 deep learning-based text summarization studies are selected for further investigation. The structure of the review is organized as follows. Firstly, it identifies and examines the deep learning models employed in both extractive and abstractive text summarization. Then, the input text’s representation methods are identified and discussed clearly. Next, training strategies used in supervised extractive summarization techniques are identified. Furthermore, mechanisms that improve the abstractive summarization process are identified. Additionally, the most commonly used datasets and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The most commonly used evaluation metrics are also identified. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions to guide future research in the field are discussed.

AB  - Early weight-bearing (EWB) following intramedullary nailing (IMN) for femur fractures remains a debated topic. This systematic review and meta-analysis, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025639691) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, aimed to evaluate the impact of EWB versus delayed weight-bearing (DWB) on functional recovery, radiographic union, and complications. A literature search across PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus identified three eligible studies comprising 537 adult patients. The analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between EWB and DWB groups in radiographic union rates, nonunion rates, or implant failure. Radiographic union was nearly identical across groups (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.96–1.05), with nonunion (RR = 1.10, 95 % CI: 0.68–1.79) and implant failure (RR = 1.95, 95 % CI: 0.55–6.87) also showing no significant differences. Sensitivity analyses, including exclusion of a moderate-quality study and model comparisons, confirmed the robustness of these findings. Most included studies were of high methodological quality. According to the GRADE framework, evidence certainty was moderate for radiographic union but low to very low for complications. While early mobilization may be safe and beneficial, further high-quality prospective trials are needed to strengthen these conclusions.

AB  - In contemporary industrial applications, predictive models have been pivotal in bolstering production efficiency, product quality, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while promoting sustainability. These predictive models can be constructed solely based on domain-specific knowledge, exclusively on observational data, or by amalgamating both approaches. They are commonly referred to as Full-, Zero-, or Partial-knowledge-based predictive models, respectively. Full-knowledge based models are highly explainable, point-wise accurate, data efficient, computationally demanding in the prediction phase to achieve high accuracy. Zero-knowledge based models are poorly explainable, data hungry, highly accurate on average, computationally demanding in the construction phase but inexpensive the prediction phase. Partial-knowledge based models focus on taking the best of the two worlds. To maintain a focused scope and avoid redundancy with existing literature, our review will primarily delve into the key industrial applications within a narrow context, encompassing sectors such as extraction, chemical processes, manufacturing, transportation, energy, and construction. Our approach entails several steps. Initially, we conducted a meta-review to pinpoint gaps in previously published surveys on Full-, Zero-, and Partial-knowledge-based predictive models for industrial applications. Subsequently, we present a formal analysis of the subject matter, supplemented with illustrative examples to offer valuable insights. The core of our work comprises a review of existing research categorized by specific industrial applications. Finally, we outline the unresolved challenges and future prospects in this burgeoning field of research. We contend that our work serves as a valuable resource, catering to the needs of both young researchers seeking a solid foundation for their studies, industrial practitioners aiming to grasp core concepts and applications, and senior researchers seeking potential real-world applications for their findings.

AB  - Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) possess transformative potential in the educational sector, facilitating digital content creation, ownership, and exchange while fostering advancements in personalized learning, certification, and resource sharing. Despite their promise, the integration of NFTs in education remains in its early stages, with existing research largely concentrating on technical and economic perspectives. This study presents a systematic review of NFTs in education, employing a bibliometric approach combined with a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards, focusing on blockchain-based credentialing, learning innovations, and associated technological and ethical challenges. Key trends, opportunities, and obstacles in NFT adoption within educational frameworks are identified by an analysis of 49 articles published between 2019 and 2023 from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. Prominent applications include blockchain-based credential verification and decentralized learning platforms. Despite NFTs' considerable potential to enhance access to educational resources and secure credential verification, significant challenges such as technological scalability, environmental impact, and regulatory uncertainties persist. Recommendations are offered for adopting energy-efficient blockchain technologies and developing robust regulatory frameworks to mitigate these challenges. Future research should prioritize sustainable technological development and critically examine the long-term implications of NFTs for educational equity in the evolving digital landscape.

AB  - The research objective of this paper is to advance knowledge about the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in complex problem-solving. A problem is complex due to the large number of highly inter-connected variables affecting the problem state. Complex problem-solving situations often change decremental or worsen, forcing a problem solver to act immediately, under considerable time pressure. While research findings support the assumption that (1) affective, (2) (meta-)cognitive, and (3) social processes support complex problem-solving, opportunities of AI for supporting complex problem-solving need to be further investigated. This article presents a scoping review of relevant literature from the last five years. The study included, N = 38 studies for coding and analysis. Our findings show that in addition to the increased number of publications, the current trend suggests increased quality of published work. Human-AI collaboration in complex problem-solving has been explored across a broad variety of AI application domains. However, the four dimensions of complex problem – namely, cognitive, metacognitive, social and affective - have been augmented by AI to a different extent. Although most of the work has been done in the cognitive domain, it is encouraging to see progress across social and affective dimensions as well. Implications for future research and practice are being discussed.

AB  - This study investigated using geopolymers as sustainable catalysts, utilizing both computational and experimental methods to improve the synthesis process. We used tools like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and hierarchical clustering algorithms to find patterns, gaps, and new topics. We also experimented to see how structural and chemical factors affect the catalyst's performance. Adding industrial waste like blast furnace slag and fly ash made catalysts that worked very well and had properties that worked well in both chemical and environmental settings. It was easier for reagents to move through and get to active sites because of the pores and the addition of nanoparticles like TiO₂ and copper ferrites. This made the catalyst work better. Geopolymer catalysts were more than 90 % effective at breaking down pollutants like Rhodamine B and methylene blue, and they stayed stable after being used more than once. Studies also showed that these materials can be used to make biodiesel, with high yields in optimized transesterification made easier by machine learning. Notably, the resulting glycerol byproduct can serve as a precursor for biopolyesters, further enhancing the economic and ecological benefits of this approach. The results consolidate geopolymers as viable and multifunctional alternatives, promoting sustainability and technological innovation. Their versatility meets industrial and environmental demands, positioning them as promising solutions for global challenges, such as pollutant mitigation and energy transition. To make sure that geopolymers can meet the growing need for clean and long-lasting technologies, future research should focus on making them more industrially scalable, stable over time, and able to use a broader range of precursors.

KW  - Systematic literature review
AB  - Background
Smart contracts are revolutionizing the way two or more parties subscribe and apply an agreement. The main reason is that they promise to increase efficiency, transparency, and security. However, their inherent vulnerabilities can lead to automated exploits, resulting in significant resource losses. Among these, reentrancy is one of the most impactful security flaws. Over the past few years, reentrancy vulnerabilities have caused substantial financial damage and threatened the viability of entire blockchain ecosystems. Therefore, investigating whether reentrancy can be effectively mitigated and exploring the methodologies designed to address it is crucial.
Methodology
The present paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts and to assess the theoretical and practical approaches proposed to counter them. By following the PRISMA framework, we conduct a literature review of academic publications to identify, screen, and analyze relevant studies on detection and mitigation techniques.
Results
Our findings indicate that the estimated financial loss due to reentrancy attacks amounted to around 350 million USD by 2023, with increasing frequency and profitability of incidents. Despite advancements in mitigation tools, particularly machine learning, they only partially address vulnerabilities and remain ineffective against zero-day attacks.
Contribution
This paper identifies critical challenges in reentrancy detection, including the lack of standardized benchmarks and data on zero-day vulnerabilities. It emphasizes the need for unified datasets and evaluation frameworks to facilitate fair comparisons, improving detection effectiveness. Additionally, it highlights the need for tools addressing all four reentrancy vulnerability types and reporting performance results.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) plays a complex role in the pathophysiology of chronic Chagas disease (CD), contributing to both host defense and tissue damage. Thus, understanding its clinical implications may support therapeutic strategies. The objective of this scoping review was to map and synthesize the available evidence on the clinical impact of serum NO levels in individuals with chronic CD. A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, in which a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed. The inclusion criteria were studies that quantified NO or its synthetizing enzymes (NOS) in individuals with chronic CD irrespective of the publication year or the language. Studies that did not assess the levels of NO, its metabolites or NOS, in addition to in vivo and in vitro experimental studies, were excluded. The findings from this scoping review showed that individuals with chronic CD have high serum NO levels, suggesting that excessive production of this marker may lead to oxidative stress and play a role in the pathophysiological process associated with cardiac and digestive complications. Combined therapies using antiparasitic drugs with antioxidants have shown a greater reduction in NO levels compared to conventional drug therapy, indicating a potential to reduce oxidative damage and consequently slow disease progression. Nonetheless, additional studies at various disease stages are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

Faced with the human inability to discern truth from falsehood and the limitations of polygraphs, the emergence of facial recognition technologies appears as a promising alternative. Although the use of facial expressions, including micro and macro-expressions, in lie detection is subject to debate, some researchers argue that these nonverbal cues could be revealing. This state-of-the-art review explores facial expression analysis through machine learning for lie detection, questioning the quality of data required to develop effective models.

This study conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize the existing research on change management within project studies and identify areas of contention and under-researched aspects before proposing an agenda for further research. It addresses the following research question: How is the management of change addressed in project studies? The analysis of prior research reveals six key themes: relationship between change management and project management, change process and factors and factors affecting the change process, change management as a success factor, change resistance, interface with permanent organizations, and change in project-based firms and industries/fields. However, this analysis also highlights the fragmented nature of prior research, emphasizing the need for more conceptual and empirical work to understand the integration of change and project management processes. Integrating change management concepts and tools into project management thinking and vice versa offers opportunities to advance both disciplines.

Studies published in English before April 2025 were used in this review, which were obtained from searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, as well as from manual searches.
Study selection
Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies focused on bone quality evaluation and six studies included volumetric assessments using AI models. The performance measures included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and Dice coefficient, and were compared with human expert evaluations. AI models demonstrated high accuracy (76.2%-99.84%), high sensitivity (78.9%-100%), and high specificity (66.2%-99%).
Conclusions
AI models have potential for the evaluation of bone quality and quantity, although standardization and external validation studies are lacking. Future studies should propose multicenter datasets, integration into clinical workflows, and the development of refined models to better reflect real-life conditions.
Clinical significance
AI has the potential to offer clinicians with reliable automated evaluations of bone quality and quantity, with the promise of a fully automated system of implant planning. It may also support preoperative workflows for clinical decision-making based on evidence more efficiently.

AB  - Background
Although physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and well-being, physical inactivity is a worldwide problem. Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategies improves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressed personalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing on persuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventions and corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing.
Objective
First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobile health interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying ML techniques in this field.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA. Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belonged to, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and study details. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given.
Results
In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groups based on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found together with a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasive strategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning to personalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-setting messages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback or educational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommender system. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages.
Conclusions
The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for this interdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additional layers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies.

AB  - Hyporheic zone, due to its constant contact with water flows, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling. Despite global advances in understanding the hyporheic zone, its importance, functions, fauna, and the ecological processes that occur there, there are still areas that require further investigation, both in Brazil and internationally. This study conducted a scientometric analysis of research on nutrients, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus, in the hyporheic zone, focusing on its temporal and geographical evolution. The main journals, authors, countries, and research lines were identified, with a particular focus on Brazil. A total of 483 articles related to nitrogen and 238 to phosphorus were selected and analyzed using the VOSviewer software. The results showed growing interest over the past two decades, with the United States, several European countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, among others), and China being the main contributors to this research, although there are still unexplored biomes and ecosystems. The analysis of graphs and networks revealed the presence of small research groups that are not well connected. Additionally, it was observed that studies on nitrogen are more abundant and multidisciplinary compared to those on phosphorus. In Brazil, most of the few studies were conducted in the last seven years. This work provides a solid foundation for future research on biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges in terms of diagnosis, as existing tests often fail to consistently distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other acute respiratory infections. Although the integration of machine learning (ML) with diagnostic procedures holds promise in addressing this issue, a comprehensive understanding of the current scientific relevance and trends of this approach has not yet been undertaken. In this study, it was conducted a bibliometric analysis to explore the significance of developing ML-based algorithms for triaging COVID-19 patients. By querying the Scopus database and employing the Bibliometrix package in R software, a dataset was obtained and analyzed. VOSviewer software was chosen to construct bibliometric networks. From January 2020 to mid-2022, a total of 1309 articles across 572 journals have been published on ML-assisted COVID-19 diagnosis, treatments, and prognosis. Notably, Scientific Reports and Computers in Biology and Medicine have seen considerable contributions. The analysis involved 6086 institutions across ninety countries, with the United States and China being the most impactful. The Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School emerge as key institutions, while Hao Chen from Westlake University (China) stands out among 10414 authors. Two major research trends were identified: the use of Random Forest ML algorithms with laboratory datasets for COVID-19 mortality prognosis, and the analysis of chest CT and X-ray images for early COVID-19 detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep Learning). In summary, this bibliographic analysis discusses the rationale of selecting Scopus as the primary database, outlines a detailed methodology for evaluating article quality, addresses the limitations of co-citation network analysis, and explores potential variations in the adoption of different ML algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

AB  - Dramatic progress in the use of AI for the design of smart learning systems has undoubtedly enhanced the professional competence of students across the globe. However, the sudden access to unlimited autonomy has posed unprecedented risks to moral and ethical practices in educational standards that far outweigh the rewards. In this research, the authors attempt to present a succinct review on the ethical implications of employing artificial intelligence in classroom education both from the educator and the student’s perspective. Summarizing the loopholes in establishing strong ethical practices by virtue of AI leverage, especially in the realm of education is of utmost importance. The findings of this study revealed two main spheres of educational transformation that need to be addressed in smart academic enterprises: (a) automated review generation based on student and evaluator scores (b)infallible system to ensure adherence to ethical practices during assessments.

AB  - Meat products are prone to lipid oxidation, which affects their quality. Although synthetic antioxidants are effective, plant extracts rich in phenolic compounds offer a promising natural alternative. This study evaluated ethanol extracts and essential oils from sage and ginger for their antioxidant potential. Ethanol extracts with the highest phenolic content—60 % sage and 80 % ginger—were selected alongside the most active essential oils. These were applied to dry fermented sausages to assess antioxidant effects. Ethanol extracts at a 2 % concentration significantly reduced lipid oxidation, with up to 75 % reduction in malondialdehyde levels compared to the control. Essential oils exhibited the strongest in vitro antioxidant activity, while ethanol extracts demonstrated better phenolic content. Substantial moisture loss during storage, indicated by water activity, likely influenced the results and highlighted the importance of controlled ripening. Overall, sage and ginger extracts showed potential as natural antioxidants in meat systems.

AB  - Despite the rapid expansion of in vitro digestion studies on microplastics (MPs), the field remains fragmented due to inconsistent methodologies, varying analytical approaches, and a lack of standardized protocols. These discrepancies hinder cross-study comparisons, complicate risk assessments, and limit the applicability of in vitro models for understanding MP fate and pollutant interactions in the gastrointestinal environment. A comprehensive synthesis is needed to assess progress, identify research gaps, and establish a unified research direction. This review systematically evaluates 85 studies (2020–2024), consolidating key findings and methodological challenges. It examines disparities in digestion protocols, fluid compositions, and exposure conditions, assessing how factors such as pH, enzyme activity, residence time, and temperature shape MPs' behavior and physicochemical transformations. Key findings on bio-corona formation, structural modifications, contaminant bioaccessibility, and interactions with digestive enzymes are synthesized to provide a clearer picture of MP behavior during digestion. With the field remains dominated by studies on polystyrene and polyethylene MPs in human-based models, inconsistencies persist, highlighting the urgent need for standardized methodologies. By addressing these gaps, this review lays a critical foundation for improving reproducibility, advancing standardization efforts, and strengthening exposure assessments, ultimately enhancing our understanding of MP ingestion risks to human health.

AB  - Transforming text into a Semantic Link Network of Words (in short W-SLN) is an approach to extracting the basic semantics from text for supporting natural language processing applications based on basic semantics within text. This paper proposes an approach to extracting W-SLN with a set of reasoning rules on semantic links for deriving implicit semantic links. Different from previous relation extraction approaches, the approach to extracting W-SLN is based on the following techniques: identification of nominal snippets for extracting semantic links, construction of semantic link patterns for extracting various types of relations from nominal snippets, and a general algorithm for automatically discovering reasoning rules with probabilities updated with inputting new texts. The approach achieves comparable performance with other rule-based and semi-supervised relation extraction approaches in terms of extraction recall and precision on the latest benchmark BenchIE. An unsupervised text summarization approach is developed by using W-SLN and a set of heuristic rules on W-SLN. Experiments on summarizing scientific papers, news and legal case reports show that the summarization approach outperforms other summarization baselines and can improve the richness, coherence, diversity and conciseness of the summary. Further, a framework based on W-SLN for question-answering on texts is introduced and verified through comparison with other approaches. The applications in text summarization and question answering applications demonstrate the generalizability of the W-SLN in supporting applications through the basic semantic representation of text.

AB  - Background
The growing availability of big data spontaneously generated by social media platforms allows us to leverage natural language processing (NLP) methods as valuable tools to understand the opioid crisis.
Objective
We aimed to understand how NLP has been applied to Reddit (Reddit Inc) data to study opioid use.
Methods
We systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies and conference abstracts in PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, and Association for Computing Machinery data repositories up to July 19, 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies investigating opioid use, using NLP techniques to analyze the textual corpora, and using Reddit as the social media data source. We were specifically interested in mapping studies’ overarching goals and findings, methodologies and software used, and main limitations.
Results
In total, 30 studies were included, which were classified into 4 nonmutually exclusive overarching goal categories: methodological (n=6, 20% studies), infodemiology (n=22, 73% studies), infoveillance (n=7, 23% studies), and pharmacovigilance (n=3, 10% studies). NLP methods were used to identify content relevant to opioid use among vast quantities of textual data, to establish potential relationships between opioid use patterns or profiles and contextual factors or comorbidities, and to anticipate individuals’ transitions between different opioid-related subreddits, likely revealing progression through opioid use stages. Most studies used an embedding technique (12/30, 40%), prediction or classification approach (12/30, 40%), topic modeling (9/30, 30%), and sentiment analysis (6/30, 20%). The most frequently used programming languages were Python (20/30, 67%) and R (2/30, 7%). Among the studies that reported limitations (20/30, 67%), the most cited was the uncertainty regarding whether redditors participating in these forums were representative of people who use opioids (8/20, 40%). The papers were very recent (28/30, 93%), from 2019 to 2022, with authors from a range of disciplines.
Conclusions
This scoping review identified a wide variety of NLP techniques and applications used to support surveillance and social media interventions addressing the opioid crisis. Despite the clear potential of these methods to enable the identification of opioid-relevant content in Reddit and its analysis, there are limits to the degree of interpretive meaning that they can provide. Moreover, we identified the need for standardized ethical guidelines to govern the use of Reddit data to safeguard the anonymity and privacy of people using these forums.

This integrative scoping review explores the applications of behavioral economics within higher education, particularly, through the lens of nudging (a concept that leverages insights from economics and psychology to guide individuals’ decisions subtly). The primary objective is to provide a broad overview of interventions that use behavioral economics principles and, secondarily, discuss their potential to improve pharmacy education and create a foundation for future research in this area.
Findings
The review analyzed 89 studies that applied behavioral economics principles in higher education settings. Reminders and prompts were the most frequently used principles, with generally positive outcomes, especially in enrollment management. Framing, incentives, and salience also demonstrated effectiveness, depending on the context. Social norms and simplification showed mixed results, whereas priming, loss aversion, feedback, comparison, and commitment had varying degrees of success in influencing behavior.
Summary
Behavioral economics principles offer valuable insights and tools for enhancing various aspects of education. The review highlights the potential for using these principles to improve student engagement, enrollment processes, and health and well-being initiatives. However, it emphasizes the importance of context-specific design and careful implementation when applying these interventions. Future research opportunities exist to further explore the applications of behavioral economics in pharmacy education and beyond.

AB  - This study conducts a meta-analysis to quantify the robust associations between landscape elements and the two main dimensions of soundscape perception—pleasantness and eventfulness—and to explain the sources of heterogeneity in these relationships. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases yielded 14 papers providing 69 independent samples for analysis. The results showed that natural elements and the crowd were generally associated with higher pleasantness, with the strongest positive correlations found for vegetation (Summary r, Sr = 0.59) and the crowd (Sr = 0.56). Anthropogenic elements exhibited a design-dependent duality: those with positive cultural and artistic attributes were positively associated with pleasantness (Sr = 0.42), while functional and traffic-related elements were negatively associated (Sr = -0.64). For eventfulness, the crowd was the strongest positive correlate (Sr = 0.61), followed by positive anthropogenic elements (Sr = 0.52) and the sky (Sr = 0.37). Conversely, functional anthropogenic elements were negatively associated with eventfulness (Sr = -0.53), while water bodies showed no significant overall association. High heterogeneity in many associations was explained through sensitivity and subgroup analyses, revealing that site function (e.g., park vs. commercial area) and element characteristics are key moderating factors. This study moves beyond qualitative descriptions to provide a quantitative, evidence-based foundation for soundscape design, offering actionable insights for creating healthier and more pleasant urban acoustic environments through context-aware landscape interventions.

AB  - The rapid expansion of the metaverse presents significant cybersecurity and privacy challenges, requiring structured, data-driven analysis. This study applies the ADO-TCM framework and BERTopic modeling to examine drivers of cybersecurity risk, theoretical responses, and interdisciplinary research gaps. Using PRISMA guidelines, 86 peer-reviewed studies were analyzed to identify key antecedents—technological vulnerabilities, user behavior, regulatory fragmentation, economic incentives, and cultural factors—shaping decisions in compliance, deployment, and education. These, in turn, influence outcomes like trust, threat mitigation, and scalability. The review identifies five latent themes: secure identity, privacy, trust, governance, and AI’s role in shaping risk. The study maps diverse theoretical lenses—cognitive, behavioral, strategic, and technological—used to interpret immersive threats and decision-making in metaverse contexts. Contributing a novel, empirically grounded synthesis, this research advances the information management literature and proposes a forward-looking agenda focused on adaptive security, ethical AI, interoperability, regulatory convergence, and intelligent, user-centric architecture for immersive ecosystems.

AB  - Voice assistants (VAs) are increasingly integrated into everyday activities and tasks, raising novel challenges for users and researchers. One emergent research direction concerns proactive VAs, who can initiate interaction without direct user input, offering unique benefits including efficiency and natural interaction. Yet, there is a lack of review studies synthesizing the current knowledge on how proactive behavior has been implemented in VAs and under what conditions proactivity has been found more or less suitable. To this end, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. We searched for articles in the ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, and PubMed, and included primary research studies reporting user evaluations of proactive VAs, resulting in 21 studies included for analysis. First, to characterize proactive behavior in VAs we developed a novel conceptual model encompassing context, initiation, and action components: Activity/status emerged as the primary contextual element, direct initiation was more common than indirect initiation, and suggestions were the primary action observed. Second, proactive behavior in VAs was predominantly explored in domestic and in-vehicle contexts, with only safety-critical and emergency situations demonstrating clear benefits for proactivity, compared to mixed findings for other scenarios. The paper concludes with a summary of the prevailing knowledge gaps and potential research avenues.

AB  - Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) constitutes a global commitment that necessitates the development of innovative strategies to integrate research, policy, and practice effectively. In the European Union (EU), multi-stakeholder engagement has become a vital strategy for tackling complex climate and energy research challenges. This approach is crucial to establishing research priorities that effectively address SDGs 7 and 13. Despite its recognized importance, the existing literature offers no comprehensive overview and guidance on effective multi-stakeholder engagement in EU-funded climate and energy research. This study shows that a scoping review, combined with stakeholder co-design workshops, can reveal key gaps and inform guidelines for robust multi-stakeholder engagement. A systematic review of 23 published articles using criteria drawn from the broader stakeholder engagement literature found that engagement terminology is rarely defined and often used interchangeably, indicating a gap between the literature and its real-world application. This study also provides guidelines for conducting effective stakeholder engagement, drawing upon the broader stakeholder engagement literature, the outcomes of the scoping review, and lessons learned during the European Climate and Energy Modelling forum project. Three co-design workshops engaging 85 stakeholders conducted in 2021 and 2022 uncovered 83 research priorities centred on policy, regulation, and using energy and climate models to inform policymaking. These research priorities are provided as an open data set. The findings of the study underscore the need for standardized engagement practices to enhance the impact of EU-funded climate and energy research and guide future policy and research initiatives.

AB  - In the face of rising cybersecurity threats like 'smishing'—SMS-based phishing attacks—this article examines how legislative efforts can effectively address these challenges. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity challenges, focusing on the still growing phenomenon of 'smishing', within the legislative context. In particular, it explores the legal landscape of cybercrime through the lens of Poland's recently enacted Act on Combating Abuses in Electronic Communication, as well as the European Union's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade. The first one serves as a significant case study for examining legislative efforts aimed at mitigating cybersecurity risks in the field of electronic communications. The article describes the multi-layered, collaborative business-state approach of the Polish law, which can provide a solid framework for addressing current and future cyber security threats. The act stands as a promising tool for fortifying national cybersecurity infrastructure and could serve as a useful example for other jurisdictions grappling with similar issues. The law also engages citizens actively in its cybersecurity initiatives, promoting collective responsibility. In the broader European Union context, while the Polish Act undergoes scrutiny, this analysis also seeks to explore its alignment with the objectives outlined in the 2020′s European Union's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade. This examination aims to evaluate the extent to which the Polish legislative framework resonates with the overarching goals set forth by the European Union, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the synergy between national initiatives and the broader European cybersecurity strategy context.

AB  - Due to the fast spread of data through digital media, individuals and societies must assess the reliability of information. Deepfakes are not a novel idea but they are now a widespread phenomenon. The impact of deepfakes and disinformation can range from infuriating individuals to affecting and misleading entire societies and even nations. There are several ways to detect and generate deepfakes online. By conducting a systematic literature analysis, in this study we explore automatic key detection and generation methods, frameworks, algorithms, and tools for identifying deepfakes (audio, images, and videos), and how these approaches can be employed within different situations to counter the spread of deepfakes and the generation of disinformation. Moreover, we explore state-of-the-art frameworks related to deepfakes to understand how emerging machine learning and deep learning approaches affect online disinformation. We also highlight practical challenges and trends in implementing policies to counter deepfakes. Finally, we provide policy recommendations based on analyzing how emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be employed to detect and generate deepfakes online. This study benefits the community and readers by providing a better understanding of recent developments in deepfake detection and generation frameworks. The study also sheds a light on the potential of AI in relation to deepfakes.

AB  - Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are navigating a new landscape due to disruptions in global supply chains and escalating geopolitical tensions in various regions. These challenges arose from a worldwide pandemic, along with the emergence of new digital technologies (e.g., AI, 5G) and the growing importance of data as a key production factor. This research systematically examines the historical causes of anti-globalization and deglobalization through a comprehensive and critical review of relevant literature. Our findings indicate that anti-globalization initially spread among developing countries before appearing in developed countries, while the trend towards deglobalization has consistently intensified. We introduce the ‘EDGES’ framework, which encompasses Economic Systems, Digital Disruptions, Geopolitical Fracture, Environmental Sustainability, and Socio-Cultural Ideology. This framework captures the crucial challenges that MNEs currently face and will face prospectively, assisting in the establishment of a dynamic strategic response mechanism (i.e., from passive compliance for minimizing risks, defensive adaptation for maintaining competitive positioning, to an integrated approach for reshaping the global landscape). This article provides valuable theoretical insights and practical managerial implications for MNEs navigating the complexities of the digital economy era.

AB  - Urban flooding poses significant challenges globally, driven by climate change and rapid urbanization. This bibliometric study reviewed 618 documents published between 2005 and 2024, focusing on rainfall-runoff modelling for urban flood mitigation. Key findings reveal that China (100 publications), the United States (81), and the United Kingdom (55) dominate research output, with emerging contributions from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Traditional models such as the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and the Hydrologic Modelling System (HECHMS) remain widely used, while machine learning (ML), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Low-Impact Development (LID) approaches drive innovation in model precision and adaptability. However, gaps persist in evaluating long-term LID effectiveness and incorporating real-time data to address extreme climate variability. By offering quantitative insights into current research efforts, this analysis highlights the critical need for integrating advanced technologies and sustainable strategies to further enhance resilience in urban flood management frameworks.

AB  - In healthcare buildings, precise thermal-humidity control is vital for infection prevention, but HVAC systems often rely on single-point sensors and uniform assumptions. However, actual indoor environments, such as hospital offices and support zones, often exhibit spatially uneven distributions of temperature and humidity, especially near ceiling regions—affecting thermal comfort, increasing mould risk, and degrading overall indoor air quality. Most existing data-driven models focus on temporal variations while overlooking spatial dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in identifying high-risk areas. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal prediction framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with Transformers to forecast ceiling-level temperature and humidity dynamics in a hospital office environment. The framework employs graph-based methods to combine multi-source sensor data, extract spatial features, and model complex spatiotemporal interactions. In addition to empirical sensor measurements, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to validate the model, particularly in boundary and data-sparse regions. Compared to conventional deep learning models, the proposed GNN-Transformer demonstrates greater generalisability, especially in edge cases. For instance, at Point 1 –an area minimally affected by spatial disturbances—under a supply airflow of 3 m/s, the CNN-Transformer, based on a similar principle, exhibited humidity prediction errors (MSE and MAE) that were 5.0192 and 1.1531 points higher, respectively, than those of the GNN-Transformer. These results underscore the critical role of using GNN expression spatial correlations in indoor microenvironment modelling and offer valuable insights for improving HVAC control strategies and mould prevention in complex healthcare spaces.

AB  - Personalised Environmental Control Systems (PECS) enable occupants to locally adjust environmental parameters without affecting others. Rooted in the fields of thermal and air quality management, this approach is key for enhancing satisfaction and well-being in the built environment by empowering occupants to control their immediate surroundings. Moreover, it offers energy-saving potential by optimizing conditions in targeted areas rather than across the entire environment. Within the framework of the IEA EBC Annex 87, the concept was explored for the first time in the acoustic domain. After defining Acoustic PECS, a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines was conducted to unpack (1) technologies in the literature aligning with this concept; (2) their impact on occupants; and (3) current limitations. The literature search, conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, APA, and PubMed, included field or laboratory studies assessing systems enabling local acoustic control in settings that are relevant for office environments. Review papers, medical device studies, and reports without insights on occupant impact were excluded. Thirty-eight studies were selected, covering active and passive systems, building-attached, furniture-integrated, and wearable devices. The qualitative analysis highlighted potential positive effects in challenging acoustic environments, including reduced annoyance, improved work performance, masking or cancellation of intrusive noises, and enhancements in short-term memory, among other benefits, despite existing technological and methodological limitations. The evidence collected is constrained by the limited number of identified studies and methodological gaps stemming from the relatively wide focus of the studies where such devices were investigated. The definition of Acoustic PECS provides a foundation for future research, guiding the development of these systems and fostering high-quality and consistent evidence of their impacts.

AB  - Almond milk is a popular dairy alternative, but it is low in nutrients. To enhance its nutrient density, unroasted, light, and dark roasted almonds were ground to different particle sizes (flour, butter, paste) and subjected to aqueous (AEP) and enzyme-assisted extraction processes (EAEP). Dark roasting increased oil extractability from flour to 79 %, while reducing particle size to butter and paste further increased oil extractability up to 96 %. Roasting enhanced protein extractability from flour (62 % dark) but reduced it from butter and paste (81 to 71 % for AEP). EAEP increased protein extractability up to 92 % for butter and paste. Microscopy revealed that roasting increased oil body bursting, cellular disruption, and protein aggregation. Butter produced milks with higher nutrient density (1.51–1.91 % protein and 4.61–5.42 % oil), reduced energy requirements, and high in vitro protein digestibility (84–88.1 %). Proteolysis and roasting reduced the α-helix content and increased unordered structures of dark roasted milk proteins. Surface hydrophobicity was reduced for unroasted and light roasted EAEP milks but increased for dark roasted milk. EAEP milk proteins exhibited higher absolute zeta potential values than AEP milk proteins. These findings underscore the potential of AEP and EAEP as alternative methods for producing almond milks with enhanced nutritional content.

AB  - Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, with growing incidence and mortality rates. Regardless of remarkable progress in cancer research, breast cancer remains a major concern due to its complex nature. These factors underscore the necessity of innovative research and diagnostic tools. Attention to gene signatures and biotechnology methods have shown significant performance in the diagnosis and management of breast cancer. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is known as a revolutionary tool to analyze data, identify biomarkers, and enrich diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. Therefore, the integration of breast cancer datasets with artificial intelligence can play a crucial role in the control of breast cancer. This review explores advanced machine learning techniques to analyze transcriptomic data while focusing on breast cancer subtype classification and its potential impact and limitations.
Method
A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, WoS, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. Duplicates were removed, two reviewers screened articles, and two additional reviewers resolved conflicts. Data extraction included details on molecular methods, AI techniques, clinical targets, study populations, and data analysis methods which were used to categorize relevant studies into RNA sequencing and gene expression profiling groups.
Result
In the initial stage, 7287 articles were identified, and 54 were retained following further screening, 24 in RNA sequencing and 30 in gene expression profiling. A review of these studies showed how artificial intelligence is advancing breast cancer research by using RNA sequencing and gene expression profiling. AI algorithms, including Random Forest, CNNs, SVMs, and LASSO, were the most applied techniques that showed significant potential to identify biomarkers, prognostic survival, and optimize drug responses to manage breast cancer.
Conclusion
The methods of artificial intelligence hold very great potential for change in the field of breast cancer. This promising progress can be seen in every aspect including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, it is important to note that we are still in the early stages of progress, and larger-scale studies and interdisciplinary collaborations in this field are needed.

AB  - Summary
Background
Machine learning and deep learning models have been increasingly used to predict long-term disease progression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to summarise the performance of such prognostic models for COPD, compare their relative performances, and identify key research gaps.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the performance of machine learning and deep learning prognostic models and identify pathways for future research. We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from database inception to April 6, 2023, for studies in English using machine learning or deep learning to predict patient outcomes at least 6 months after initial clinical presentation in those with COPD. We included studies comprising human adults aged 18–90 years and allowed for any input modalities. We reported area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% CI for predictions of mortality, exacerbation, and decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). We reported the degree of interstudy heterogeneity using Cochran's Q test (significant heterogeneity was defined as p≤0·10 or I2>50%). Reporting quality was assessed using the TRIPOD checklist and a risk-of-bias assessment was done using the PROBAST checklist. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022323052).
Findings
We identified 3620 studies in the initial search. 18 studies were eligible, and, of these, 12 used conventional machine learning and six used deep learning models. Seven models analysed exacerbation risk, with only six reporting AUC and 95% CI on internal validation datasets (pooled AUC 0·77 [95% CI 0·69–0·85]) and there was significant heterogeneity (I2 97%, p<0·0001). 11 models analysed mortality risk, with only six reporting AUC and 95% CI on internal validation datasets (pooled AUC 0·77 [95% CI 0·74–0·80]) with significant degrees of heterogeneity (I2 60%, p=0·027). Two studies assessed decline in lung function and were unable to be pooled. Machine learning and deep learning models did not show significant improvement over pre-existing disease severity scores in predicting exacerbations (p=0·24). Three studies directly compared machine learning models against pre-existing severity scores for predicting mortality and pooled performance did not differ (p=0·57). Of the five studies that performed external validation, performance was worse than or equal to regression models. Incorrect handling of missing data, not reporting model uncertainty, and use of datasets that were too small relative to the number of predictive features included provided the largest risks of bias.
Interpretation
There is limited evidence that conventional machine learning and deep learning prognostic models demonstrate superior performance to pre-existing disease severity scores. More rigorous adherence to reporting guidelines would reduce the risk of bias in future studies and aid study reproducibility.
Funding
None.

AB  - Tension leg platform (TLP) floating wind turbines (FWTs) represent a promising frontier in the research and development of the offshore wind industry. The recent completion of the first TLP floating wind farm, Provence Grand Large, marks a significant milestone. Compared to other FWT designs, TLP FWTs have advantages in motion dynamics and structural utilization, leading to improved performance and reduced cost. However, their unique physical characteristics require specialized design considerations and innovative solutions for practical implementation. To facilitate the development of next-generation TLP FWTs, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review focused on various design aspects: development, technical challenges, requirements, innovative concepts, and research methods. An overview is provided, detailing key design parameters of existing TLP FWTs, such as weight, displacement, installed capacity, and the natural period of motion. Additionally, the design challenges of TLP FWTs are summarized. Afterwards, the TLP FWT designs are classified and critically reviewed, highlighting the design features and installation methods of innovative concepts while identifying development trends in the field. Then, numerical and experimental methods for design are discussed, along with current research gaps. Finally, this paper presents four key areas for future research on TLP FWTs.

AB  - Since the development of the planetary boundaries (PBs) framework, efforts have been made to operationalise PBs at sub-global scales, from cities to continents. Many of these efforts employ Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (EEIOA), which integrates environmental and material considerations into supply chain analyses. Despite the growing body of research combining PBs and EEIOA, the research is dispersed across various studies and disciplines, necessitating a systematic synthesis to consolidate findings, identify gaps, and guide future research. To address this need, we conducted a systematic literature review focusing on research that integrates the PB framework with EEIOA. Our aim was to answer several key questions, including: What are the most common methodological choices used in studies combining PBs and EEIOA? How has EEIOA informed policy decisions related to living within PBs? Using Scopus and Web of Science, we conducted a comprehensive search covering publications from January 2009 to April 2024. Our review revealed four main methodological frameworks in the literature: “footprint v/s allocated PB”, “exceedance footprint”, “scenario analysis”, and “optimisation modelling”. Climate change emerged as the most extensively studied PB, followed by land-system change, freshwater use, nitrogen flows, and phosphorus flows. Policy guidance was central in 50 % of the studies, with 61 % following a responsibility narrative, 15 % human well-being, and 9 % examining socio-economic implications. This review provides critical insights into the intersection of PB and IOA, highlighting methodological trends and gaps. By synthesizing findings, it advances the integration of these frameworks, supporting their application in sustainable consumption policies and broader environmental strategies.

Yet, despite the extensive engagement with prototyping, vocabulary and conceptualizations of the phenomenon still vary and research remains fragmented, hampering empirical and conceptual development. In this paper, we address this by exploring the concept of prototyping in management research. Through an integrative literature review, the study contributes with an inductively developed definition of prototyping that stresses the representational nature of prototyping. Based on the definition, we organize the diverse, fragmented, and eclectic body of work into seven distinct themes. We then compare and elaborate these themes and organize them into three aggregate dimensions to offer an initial sketch of how prototyping materializes from cognitive externalization to conative interaction an how these interdependent processes creates various organizational outcomes. Finally, we suggest future avenues for examining the integration of the fragmented themes and for exploring research opportunities between and within the them.

AB  - The importance of electric vehicles is steadily increasing in times of climate change. While the focus was initially on private cars, the area of commercial vehicles, especially trucks, becomes increasingly important. Electrically powered trucks offer great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in goods transport. However, the environmental impact of electric vehicle batteries poses a critical challenge, necessitating effective strategies for managing their circular economy. Due to their significant weight and complex storage, supply, and retrieval processes, unique logistical and operational issues arise. Efficient spare parts management is crucial, especially since specialized battery storage facilities are often distant from the points of use. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to enhance circular supply in spare parts management, with a focus on heavy-duty electric trucks. Given the scarcity of research on circular spare parts management in the existing literature, a comprehensive structured literature review was undertaken. Insights from this review guided the creation of the proposed framework, using battery lifecycle management in the trucking sector as a representative example. Furthermore, expert interviews were conducted to validate its practicality. The paper concludes with suggestions for advancing sustainable electric vehicle battery management practices.

AB  - Insurance is a pivotal element in modern society, but insurers face a persistent challenge from fraudulent behaviour performed by policyholders. This behaviour could be detrimental to both insurance companies and their honest customers, but the intricate nature of insurance fraud severely complicates its efficient, automated detection. This study surveys fifty recent publications on automobile insurance fraud detection, published between January 2019 and March 2023, and presents both the most commonly used data sets and methods for resampling and detection, as well as interesting, novel approaches. The study adopts the highly-cited Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology for software engineering research proposed by Kitchenham and Charters and collected studies from four online databases. The findings indicate limited public availability of automobile insurance fraud data sets. In terms of detection methods, the prevailing approach involves supervised machine learning methods that utilise structured, intrinsic features of claims or policies and that lack consideration of an example-dependent cost of misclassification. However, alternative techniques are also explored, including the use of graph-based methods, unstructured textual data, and cost-sensitive classifiers. The most common resampling approach was found to be oversampling. This SLR has identified commonly used methods in recent automobile insurance fraud detection research, and interesting directions for future research. It adds value over a related review by also including studies published from 2021 onward, and by detailing the used methodology. Limitations of this SLR include its restriction to a small number of considered publication years and limited validation of choices made during the process.

AB  - Valorizing biomass by-products and reducing their accumulation are critical current issues. Nevertheless, the large volume of such materials requires continuous and enhanced strategies to mitigate potential environmental problems. The valorization of biomass through the recovery of valuable compounds must be sustainable and optimized, emphasizing the selection of optimal and greener solvents for this purpose. In this context, to reduce experimental efforts, material resources, and energy expenses, predictive in silico tools enable efficient preliminary screening, highlighting the tools based on Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). Considering their widespread application, this review critically analyzes both computational methods, highlighting their main concepts, applications, and limitations. Finally, we propose a simplified guide from solvent selection to the purified (or not) fraction.

AB  - Background
Despite a rise in the number of women in orthopedic surgery over recent decades, their representation in academic and leadership roles remains limited. Authorship in research journals serves as a key indicator of academic involvement. We conducted a retrospective study to assess: (1) the rate of publications by women first and senior authors from 1990 to 2024, and (2) indexed publications and citation impact (3) gender differences in authorship by subspecialty and study type.
Hypothesis
The authorship gender disparity may no longer persist over the past 30 years in a high-impact French orthopedic journal.
Methods
This study analyzed all articles published in Revue de Chirurgie Orthopédique et Réparatrice de l'Appareil Moteur (RCOT) and Orthopaedic and Traumatology Surgery and Research (OTSR) during four periods (1990–1994, 2000–2004, 2010–2014, 2020–2024). The gender of first and senior authors, subspecialties, gender ratios, and their evolution over time were assessed. Indexed publications and citation impact were also reported.
Results
A total of 3,256 articles were included. Over the 30 years, the proportion of women first and senior authors increased significantly from 15/402 (3.7%) in 1990–1994, to 35/502 (7%) in 2000–2004, 120/950 (12.6%) in 2010–2014, and 306/1,402 (21.8%) in 2020–2024 (p < 0.0001). Specifically, the rate of female first authorship rose from 10/392 (2.5%) to 114/1,210 (13.7%) and senior authorship from 5/367 (1.2%) to 114/1,233 (8.1%) (p < 0.0001). Citation impact improved, with 24 articles reaching the top 10% most cited in the latest period, including 4 in the top 1%. Subspecialty analysis showed increased female authorship across all fields, particularly in paediatrics (+48.4%), hand (+32.5%), elbow (+29.2%), and tumor/infection (+35%) from 2020–2024. Significant increases were observed in most subspecialties (p < 0.05), except knee, shoulder, comment, elbow, and infection.
Discussion
This study shows a growing female presence in orthopedic publications, with notable subspecialty preferences. Sustaining this trend requires leaders of all genders to mentor and support future candidates. By fostering an inclusive environment that values gender diversity, the field can continue to progress, ensuring equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, and ultimately enriching the discipline.

AB  - The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twin technology is reshaping maintenance strategies in the era of Industry 4.0. However, gaps persist between academic advancements and industrial adoption and expectation. This study systematically investigates the landscape of AI-enhanced digital twins for maintenance by integrating a systematic literature review (SLR) of related studies with in-depth interviews from industry practitioners. Our analysis reveals that while academia demonstrates robust applications of supervised, deep, and reinforcement learning to optimize digital twin models and prescribe data-driven actions, industrial implementation remains limited by challenges such as high scale dimension, data integration complexities, and insufficient workforce readiness. We identified and articulated three critical gap dimensions, scale, data, and model between academic research and industrial implementation and expectation. To bridge these gaps, we proposed a comprehensive five-layer framework for AI-enhanced digital twins, encompassing physical assets, data transmission, digital twins, AI analytics, and maintenance services. Actionable recommendations are provided, including the adoption of modular architectures, standardized data protocols, hybrid edge-cloud solutions, and targeted workforce upskilling. Our findings not only clarify the current state and challenges of AI-driven digital twins in maintenance but also offer a practical roadmap for accelerating their industrial implementation. This work advances the field by integrating insights from both academic research and industrial practice, offering concrete recommendations to support the practical realization of smart and sustainable maintenance practices.

AB  - The bi-annual international congress on autoimmunity is a huge opportunity for the medical community to discuss the latest updates in the field. During the 14th congress 2024 (AUTO14) in Ljubljana, artificial intelligence (AI) occupied special attention due to its recent and ongoing unequivocal role in various medical fields including autoimmunity. For instance, through a challenging debate between world-experts and the most popular AI bot used (ChatGPT), several clinical cases including a case of vasculitis were discussed in the plenary sessions. ChatGPT agreed with the clinical decisions made by the experts nevertheless, the bot added additional aspects related to the specific case. In this regard, ChatGPT emphasized the need for osteoporosis prophylaxis in a patient planned to be treated with systemic steroids for a long time. Furthermore, AUTO14 included the newest updates on most autoimmune disorders, distributed among tens of sessions. Among others, infection and autoimmunity, the sequalae of the pandemic of COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 vaccines were discussed as well. Due to the high numbers of the works presented, and for ensuring that important updates are not missed; we divided our paper into sections. The subtitles throughout the paper correspond to different sessions of the congress, all presenting new updates in the field. A figure aiding in navigating throughout the paper was also provided.

Psychological safety (PS) is an important factor influencing team well-being and performance, particularly in collaborative and dynamic domains such as software development. Despite its acknowledged significance, research on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the context of software engineering.
Objective:
This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software development process.
Methods:
A systematic literature review was conducted, encompassing studies retrieved from four digital libraries. The extracted data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses.
Results:
The findings indicate a growing academic interest in PS within software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson’s framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team, and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and leadership behaviors. The presence of PS was found to positively impact team dynamics, software quality, technical excellence, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, PS was observed to mediate relationships between constructs such as ethical leadership and innovative behavior.
Conclusion:
PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective strategies for its enhancement. Future research should address these gaps by investigating the practical applications of PS within diverse organizational settings in the software engineering domain.

AB  - In response to the increasing digitalization of asylum procedures, this paper examines the legal challenges surrounding the use of automated tools in refugee status determination (RSD). Focusing on the European Union (EU) context, where interoperable databases and advanced technologies are employed to streamline asylum processes, the paper asks how EU fundamental rights can address the challenges that automation raises. Through a comprehensive analysis of EU law and several real-life cases, the paper focuses on the relationship between procedural fairness and the use of automated tools to provide evidence in RSD. The paper illustrates what standards apply to automated systems based on a legal doctrinal analysis of EU primary and secondary law and emerging case law from national courts and the CJEU. The article contends that the rights to privacy and data protection enhance procedural fairness in asylum procedures and shows how they can be leveraged for increased protection of asylum seekers and refugees. Moreover, the paper also claims that asylum authorities carry a new pivotal responsibility as the medium between the technologies, asylum seekers and their rights.

AB  - Formation of energy-based industrial symbiosis networks (EISNs) is a measure by which industries can address their high energy consumption. EISNs are often designed through mathematical programming (MP) because this method can represent the integration of numerous entities in a compact model while allowing tradeoff analysis of various EISN design objectives. In view thereof, this study presents a systematic review of MP models for EISN optimization. It addresses the research gap on the lack of studies which review the use of MP for optimizing EISNs involving waste heat as the shared resource. The models were analyzed based on five features: the typology of objective functions, the integrated entities in the EISN, the waste heat use options, the effects of considering distance between entities, and the method for modelling parameter uncertainty. This study has uncovered several gaps in EISN modelling. First, there is no consensus about the most relevant environmental and social impacts to include in EISN optimization. Second, novel approaches to simplify nonconvex models are scarce, thereby hindering the incorporation of more pertinent entities into the models due to the concomitant increase in solution time. Third, models analyzing the tradeoff among the various waste heat utilization pathways are limited. Fourth, most models do not include the implications of considering the physical layout of integrated entities in optimizing EISN design. Finally, the best method to incorporate parameter uncertainty in models is still unsettled. By addressing these gaps, more comprehensive MP models can be developed, thereby supporting better-informed decisions about EISN establishment.

Therefore, timely crack detection is crucial for preventing further damage and ensuring the safety of these structures. Traditional manual inspection methods are limited by factors such as time consumption, subjectivity, and labor intensity. To address these challenges, deep learning-based crack detection technologies have emerged as promising solutions, demonstrating satisfactory performance and accuracy. However, the field still lacks comprehensive scientometric analyses and critical surveys of existing works, which are vital for identifying research gaps and guiding future studies. This paper conducts a bibliometric and critical analysis of the collected literature, providing novel insights into current research trends and identifying potential areas for future investigation. Analytical tools, including VOSviewer and CiteSpace, were employed for in-depth analysis and visualization. This study identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions, focusing on advancements in model generalization, computational efficiency, dataset standardization, and the practical application of crack detection methods.

22 studies were included, containing 3473 women and 56 HCPs. No studies were identified for views of birth partners. Women reported they wanted more antenatal and postnatal information about childbirth related perineal trauma, that experiences of perineal repair were affected by health care professional behaviours, and that postnatal care was not always sufficient to meet their needs. Health care professionals highlighted a need for improved education for providing care to women after childbirth related perineal trauma.
Conclusions
Findings from the review can inform the development of care pathways to improve care and associated outcomes for women after childbirth related perineal trauma. Further research is needed to explore the views of birth partners and a wider range of health care professionals involved in caring for women after childbirth related perineal trauma.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.

AB  - Introduction
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common head and neck cancer, linked to tobacco, alcohol, and HPV. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), associated with gastrointestinal cancers, may also play a role in OSCC and oral premalignant disorders (OPMDs). This meta-analysis examines the potential association between H. pylori, OSCC, and its precursor lesions.
Methodology
Following PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched until July 30, 2024. Eligible studies focused on OSCC, OPMDs, and H. pylori. Data on study characteristics and detection methods were extracted. Bias was evaluated using the New Castle Ottawa Scale. Statistical analysis utilized a random-effects model in RevMan, reporting odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with I².
Results
Twenty-three studies were included. Pooled estimates showed significantly more patients with OSCC and oral lichen planus (OLP) tested positive for H. pylori, with estimates of 0.17 [0.03, 0.31] and 0.19 [0.04, 0.34], respectively. Tissue sample studies indicated a significant association between H. pylori and OSCC (5.57 [3.23, 9.60]). However, data from other sample types were insufficient for pooled estimates.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis provides preliminary evidence of H. pylori's role in OSCC and OPMDs, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection. Significant research gaps remain in H. pylori detection across various sample types, emphasizing the need for further studies, especially regarding non-invasive screening methods like saliva analysis.

AB  - This study aimed to identify emerging trends and topics in strategic management and sustainable development research in the context of global disruptions, especially when they combine into polycrises, contributing to a state of uncertainty known as the non-ergodic world. The authors employed the Scopus database to collect and analyse academic literature from 2015 to 2023. Additionally, they reviewed United Nations reports to complement the academic data with a statistical analysis of the progress made in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The results revealed discrepancies in this progress, with advances in poverty eradication, responsible consumption and production and climate action. However, more progress is needed to reduce hunger, preserve life on land and below water, promote peace, establish justice and strengthen institutions. This lack of focus is also mirrored in the most cited academic research on strategic management and sustainable development. The analysed research experienced a 13.0 % annual growth, with an average of 26.9 citations from 84 countries. The bibliometric analysis identified further research areas, including sustainable economic development, business sustainability strategies, leadership, and the impact of global disruptions. Thus, reflecting the challenges of achieving the United Nations Agenda 2030 in the context of global disruptions, this study confirmed the increasing role of integrating sustainable development considerations into strategic management research and highlighted the need for more research and action to meet the SDGs.

In the last decade, it has been also widely used in Precision Agriculture (PA) and Wild Flora Monitoring (WFM) to address a set of problems with a big impact on economy, society and academia, heralding a paradigm shift across the industry and academia. Many applications in those fields involve image processing and computer vision stages. Remote sensing devices are very popular choice for image acquisition in this context, and in particular, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a good tradeoff between cost and area coverage. For these reasons, research literature is rich of works that face problems in Precision Agriculture and Wild Flora Monitoring domains with machine learning/computer vision methods applied to UAV imagery. In this work, we review this literature, with a special focus on algorithms, model sizing, dataset characteristics and innovative technical solutions presented in many domain-specific models, providing the reader with an overview of the research trend in recent years.

AB  - Background
Early-onset hypertension (HT) presents compounded risks for cardiovascular, renal, and other systemic complications. Childhood HT is associated with HT during adulthood and detrimental lifelong cardiovascular disease events. However, most of the cases are not detectable as HT measurement in children is complicated and unstable. The global prevalence of HT among children is rapidly increasing. A previous study (2019) reported that the pooled global HT prevalence is 4.0% and the number is believed to be elevated. However, prevalence estimates of childhood HT have rarely been synthesized globally.
Objective
This study aims to systematically pool all evidence from published articles and synthesize the evidence on the global prevalence of childhood HT and antihypertensive (anti-HT) use among children and its effects.
Methods
This systematic review of observational and experimental studies will investigate the overall prevalence of HT and anti-HT use among children. We will search articles from 4 web-based databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and Scopus using the specific keywords across the databases. During the article search conducted until October 2024, we retrieved 14,575 articles. Articles published in the English language with full text and are peer-reviewed journals included children aged between 0 and 18 years, confirmed with HT or high blood pressure (BP) on at least 3 separate occasions, and stated the definition of HT will be included in this protocol. Study selection and reporting will follow the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines and Cochrane Risk of bias tool (ACROBAT) for experimental studies. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction form using Microsoft Excel software and the studies’ quality will be assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s guideline according to the study design. We will use STATA software (version 17.0; StataCorp LLC) to calculate the global pooled prevalence and RevMan software (version 5.4; StataCorp LLC) to observe the effect of anti-HT use and BP among children. The risk of bias will be assessed using a funnel plot.
Results
We retrieved 14,575 articles from 4 databases in October 2024. We will report the current global overall or pooled prevalence of HT as well as by region, risk factors, anti-HT use, and the anti-HT BP-lowering effect among the general children population. The findings will be presented in summary table findings and forest plot. This review is expected to be completed in the middle of 2025.
Conclusions
This review will provide a comprehensive synthesis of the overall prevalence of HT among children—a public health issue of growing concern with long-term impact. This review will also provide important information to inform practice in developing effective strategies for preventing and managing childhood HT.

AB  - Buildings face threats from various emergencies, with emergency evacuation being a key measure for occupant safety. However, enhancing evacuation efficiency necessitates detailed studies of building characteristics and human behaviors. Despite this, a systematic review of digital twin technologies for emergency evacuation is still lacking. Therefore, by collecting and analyzing literature from 2004 to 2025 using PRISMA methodology, this study first proposes a conceptual digital twin framework that integrates buildings, occupants, and their interactions, encompassing the entire loop of sensing, updating, simulation, and decision-making. The current research has made significant progresses in areas such as basic virtual modeling, one-way data mapping, and preliminary bidirectional interaction. However, studies and applications of digital twins remain in the developmental stage, with most at maturity levels L0-L2, while L4-L5 applications are still relatively scarce. It is suggested that the future development of digital twin-based evacuation systems must rely on multidisciplinary collaboration to achieve breakthroughs, including optimizing underlying mechanisms to enhance data and system integration; improving sensing accuracy and developing adaptive algorithms for simulation, prediction and assessment; integrating emerging artificial intelligence technologies while addressing data ethics; and enhancing computational efficiency to strengthen system robustness.

AB  - SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is highly heterogeneous and metastatic, and the mechanisms driving OSCC development, progression, and metastasis remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 231,442 cells obtained from the tumor core (TC), tumor periphery (TP), adjacent surrounding tissue (ST), and metastatic lymph node (mLN) samples of 10 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative OSCC. TP and TC showed no major immune cell phenotype differences. Interestingly, partial EMT (p-EMT) cells showed significant activation of glycolysis and hypoxia signatures, serving as potential biomarkers for clinical outcomes. Moreover, p-EMT scores of epithelial cells positively correlated with M2 scores of tumor-associated macrophages, while the proportion of p-EMT at TP was negatively associated with that of GZMB+ exhausted CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic potential and TNFRSF9+ mast cells, conferring adverse prognosis. Our study provides insights into understanding the interplay between intratumoral heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment of advanced HPV-negative OSCC.

AB  - The anticipated surge in hydrogen energy adoption underscores the pivotal role of social acceptance in determining the viability of hydrogen technologies (HTs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of acceptance research on HT, evaluating measurement tools and utilized models, identifying influencing factors, and analyzing academic discourse on HT diffusion. Drawing from 39 studies, it highlights key acceptance factors: trust, environmental attitudes, subjective knowledge, and perceived risks. Discourse analysis uncovers perceived barriers like trust deficits, infrastructural challenges, and financial constraints, while strategic considerations such as timing and transparency are identified as drivers. The findings emphasize an individual-centred perspective, heterogeneous operationalizations, and a lack of longitudinal studies. The authors propose increased downstream research, focusing on societal reactions to implemented technologies and considering both psychological and contextual factors. Adoption of multi-level and institutional perspectives is essential.

AB  - Researchers today face significant challenges reshaping the landscape of academic, government, and industry research due to the exponential growth of global research outputs and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). The annual increase in published works has made it difficult for traditional literature review and data analysis methods to keep pace, often rendering reviews outdated by the time of publication. In response, this methods article introduces a suite of new tools designed to automate a number of stages for systematic literature reviews. Designated SPARK (Systematic Processing and Automated Review Kit), the new computational-based approaches presented in this article automate the collection, organisation, and filtering of journal articles, alongside a data extraction scaffolding technique, for use in a systematic literature review on trauma-informed policing. As global research outputs rise, so does the need for automated methods. This paper highlights how these methods can enhance research efficiency and impact.•Hard-coded tools can be utilised to automate research.•Hard-coded tools do not carry the dangers of ‘hallucinations’ that GenAI infused tools may.•Hard-coded automation tools allow researchers to keep up to date with contemporary research outputs while maintaining a high level of control in the research process.

AB  - This study explored how low-threshold, XR-enhanced maker environments can support preservice teachers’ (PSTs) engagement with computational thinking (CT) practices and perceptions. Using a scaffolded, three-week module built around Roblox Studio, non–computer science PSTs engaged in iterative game design activities progressing from paper prototypes to storyboard rule maps and interactive 3D builds. Findings suggest that design tasks encouraged shifts from surface-level CT definitions to more applied reasoning, particularly in decomposition and algorithmic thinking during storyboard development. However, participants encountered new challenges during 3D implementation, including spatial logic demands and limited debugging fluency. Reflections highlighted frequent micro-debug cycles and collaboration as key supports, even when such processes were not fully visible in final artifacts. While many PSTs remained hesitant about coding, most recognized transferable skills—such as perseverance, creativity, and empathy—as relevant to their future teaching. These results highlight the promise and complexity of XR maker spaces as a bridge between conceptual CT understanding and authentic classroom application. Implications include the need for scaffolded supports targeting spatial reasoning, rule-system translation, and reflective design dispositions in CT-focused teacher education.

AB  - Cognitive biases have been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of depression and anxiety, but their utility in predicting future symptoms remains debated. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the overall effect size of their predictive effects and to identify moderators relevant to theory and methodology. The study protocol was pre-registered on PROSPERO (record number: CRD42021232236). Searches of PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, PsyArXiv Preprints, and ProQuest Dissertations yielded 81 studies with 621 contrasts and 17,709 participants through December 2024. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Results from a three-level meta-analysis revealed a small overall effect size (β = 0.04, 95 %-CI [0.02, 0.06], p < .001) and significant between- and within-study variance after removal of outliers. Equivalent effect sizes were found for the predictive utility of cognitive biases in children/adolescents and adults, for increased negative bias and decreased positive bias, and for anxiety and depression outcomes. The magnitude of the overall effect was moderated by the cognitive process, with significant effect sizes for interpretation bias and memory bias but not for attention bias. These findings support the predictive role of cognitive biases in anxiety and depression, with interpretation and memory biases emerging as key markers. These findings have implications for cognitive theories of depression and anxiety and for clinical interventions.

AB  - Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease, exacting high morbidity and mortality worldwide. CAD is detected on coronary artery imaging; coronary artery segmentation (CAS) of the images is essential for coronary lesion characterization. Both CAD detection and CAS require expert input, are labor-intensive, and error-prone.
Objectives
Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved significant success in CAS and CAD detection, with many studies published recently. This study is an up-to-date systematic review of research on automated DL models for CAS and CAD detection in the past decade (2013-2024).
Method
Using PRISMA methodology, an initial literature search of 1,589 publications was conducted, from which 97 high-impact Q1 studies were selected based on pre-defined eligibility criteria. These studies were analyzed in terms of DL techniques employed, datasets, modalities, and performance metrics.
Results
Of the 97 studies, most of which were published after 2016, 47 focused on CAS, 49 on CAD detection, and one on both tasks. CNN-based models were dominant in both domains. For CAS, CCTA was the most frequently used input modality, and U-Net was employed in 38 out of 48 studies, with recent works incorporating attention mechanisms and graph neural networks. ASOCA was the most widely used benchmark dataset. For CAD detection, ECG was the most common modality, with 45 out of 50 studies utilizing CNNs, and 20 of those relying purely on CNN architectures. Hybrid and multimodal models have become more prominent in recent years.
Conclusion
This review identified several challenges, including limited public datasets, variability in performance metrics, and model complexity. Future studies should focus on larger, diverse datasets and lightweight models integrating explainable artificial intelligence and uncertainty quantification to improve clinical applicability.

AB  - The agri-food systems face many global and local challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation, and loss of biodiversity. As the global population continues to rise, the demand for food and other ecosystem services also increases, escalating the pressure on agri-food systems. There is an urgent need to transition agri-food systems’ goals from production efficiency to sustainability to address these challenges. Within agri-food systems, niche marketing has gained prominence in achieving sustainability. Using the PRISMA framework, this study performs a systematic literature review up to November 2024 to gather existing evidence on how niche markets can promote sustainable agri-food systems while also identifying challenges and policy options. To this end, two databases were employed: Web of Sciences and Scopus. Findings from the selected literature (58 articles) indicate that developing niche markets to deliver sustainable agriculture is subject to various challenges related to risk exposure, entry barriers, changing consumer preferences, and institutional context. In general, three main ways through which niche markets can support sustainable agri-food systems were identified. Firstly, niche markets provide financial incentives to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices by increasing the price premiums and limiting competitors' market access. Secondly, niche markets facilitate partnerships and networks that enable sharing know-how and best practices, reducing the high cost of transitioning to sustainable production systems. Thirdly, niche markets promote radical innovations and technologies that enable increased economic efficiency and environmental performance. In terms of policy implications, public initiatives fostering the expansion of niche markets in agri-food production should increase financial support, access to credit, and legal recognition of certifications for environmentally friendly products. Other measures include fostering knowledge transfer and networking between farmers and consumers.

AB  - Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) discusses the act of attacking and defending Machine Learning (ML) Models, an essential building block of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML is applied in many software-intensive products and services and introduces new opportunities and security challenges. AI and ML will gain even more attention from the industry in the future, but threats caused by already-discovered attacks specifically targeting ML models are either overseen, ignored, or mishandled. Current AML research investigates attack and defense scenarios for ML in different industrial settings with a varying degree of maturity with regard to academic rigor and practical relevance. However, to the best of our knowledge, a synthesis of the state of academic rigor and practical relevance is missing. This literature study reviews studies in the area of AML in the context of industry, measuring and analyzing each study’s rigor and relevance scores. Overall, all studies scored a high rigor score and a low relevance score, indicating that the studies are thoroughly designed and documented but miss the opportunity to include touch points relatable for practitioners.

AB  - Technology changes at ever increasing speeds. Therefore, it is crucial for practitioners and academics to understand why users’ intend to continue or discontinue their usage. This paper presents a current and comprehensive systematic literature review on continuance intentions for mobile applications. The review analyzes 119 studies from the Scopus database (January 2019–December 2023) using the PRISMA, SPAR, and TCCM frameworks. It identifies key theoretical models, determinants of mobile app continuance intention, research methods, existing gaps, and future research directions. Findings reveal that several well-recognised theoretical models are frequently applied in the literature on continuance intention. Consequently, the variables derived from these models are among the most commonly measured by researchers. Additionally, the majority of studies in this area employ quantitative methods, with structural equation modelling being most widely used. This review categorises the literature based on mobile application classifications and six distinct sets of factors influencing continuance intention: psychological, technical, social, behavioural, contextual, and barriers. Furthermore, it explores the outcomes associated with continuance intention. The paper identifies two primary areas for future research: the development of a conceptual framework and research design. It also highlights research opportunities related to emerging technologies and the gap between intentions and actual behaviours.

AB  - Within the water-energy-food nexus, desalination and refrigeration cogeneration systems are able to address pressing sustainable development goals. Such systems exploit the synergy between the two processes to yield mutual benefits. This review evaluates existing cogeneration studies to recommend promising research directions for sustainable development applications such as simultaneous freshwater production and cold storage refrigeration. Compared to recent reviews of combined desalination and cooling systems, the novelty of this review is in its focus on refrigeration temperatures suitable for fresh food storage (between 0–15 °C), differentiating hybrid systems as Integrated or Coupled, and highlighting the potential technical and economic synergies between refrigeration and desalination systems for sustainable development applications. The key aspects examined included (1) capacity of desalination and refrigeration, (2) source of water and potential contaminants, (3) system design and synergies, (4) efficiency of energy and material resources, and (5) integration with renewable energy sources. The primary synergy in integrated systems was the simultaneous low-temperature evaporation of water and chilling of a cooling fluid. In coupled systems, the synergy comes from the usage of waste heat from refrigeration systems to drive thermal desalination processes. Regarding performance, the systems with the highest water recovery rates and thermal desalination efficiencies are hybrid multiple effect distillation systems. Promising directions for future research include experimentally validating numerically derived inferences, achieving deeper heat integration to improve system efficiency, and developing passive measures such as indirect evaporative cooling for simultaneous dehumidification, cooling, and water production.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterised by deficits of social communication and social interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns in behaviours, activities and interests. People diagnosed with ASD may need lifetime treatment for social inclusion and control of stereotypical behaviour, on which art therapy has played an important role. Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) has been applied with technology for interventions in social and motor rehabilitation. It has helped people with ASD to integrate in society and develop motor skills, though there are few studies that focus on their artistic expression through the dance and free movements. This review spans the interventions of DMT in technology for people with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, during the last six years, with a query on the technologies and application cases. The purpose of this study is to review more than 50 studies and discuss the most relevant technological aspects classified according to the application theme. Our general contribution is to give an overview of the current state of the art and provide guidelines for future research on DMT applications for people with ASD, orientated in the development of technologies that combine dance and visual arts for therapy uses. This research highlights how technology can enhance DMT by creating immersive and interactive environments that facilitate better engagement and expression for individuals with ASD. The study emphasises the importance of multidisciplinary approaches, involving artists, designers, and therapists, to develop richer, more inclusive therapeutic experiences. The findings suggest that technology does not need to be advanced or expensive to be effective; simplicity and user-friendliness are key to successful interventions.

AB  - Investments, including those allocated for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), need to be appraised before project implementation. Despite scholars' efforts to evaluate DRR investments over the years, a notable gap exists in the literature regarding systematic reviews focused on this topic. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of previous studies assessing the feasibility of DRR investments. The dataset for this review comprised 87 articles sourced from the Scopus database. The findings have been presented according to the research questions of the study, the methods used for appraisal of DRR investments, the types of costs and benefits considered, and the strengths and limitations identified by studies related to the appraisal techniques. Additionally, bibliographic data, the types of hazards considered for DRR investments, and the study contexts were identified. Notably, a significant portion of studies focused on the USA, with investments for flood mitigation representing the majority of investment appraisals. The findings highlighted that cost-benefit analysis was the predominant method used for evaluating DRR investments. Generally, cost estimation was straightforward, which included the initial investment and the maintenance expenses. However, discrepancies exist in the benefits considered by different researchers and the approaches used to quantify them. Based on these findings, the authors suggest future research directions and recommendations aimed at enhancing investment appraisals for DRR.

This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive review of 18 articles out of 81 published between 2019 and 2023, retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using the PRISMA framework. Thematic analysis revealed 12 key themes that capture the complex influence of digital platforms on gig workers, suggesting that platforms offer both opportunities and challenges. Digital platforms provide low barriers to entry, facilitate task allocation, and offer flexible work arrangements. However, gig workers face significant challenges, such as a lack of social protections, algorithmic control, intense competition, and downward pressure on wages. The implications are significant for sustainable economic development in the platform economy, underscoring the importance of collective organizing, re-evaluating platform practices, and strengthening labor regulations. As the gig economy expands globally, researchers, platforms, and policymakers must work together to ensure that the benefits of digital platforms are shared more equitably and that gig workers can thrive in this new world of work. Given the scarcity of papers published about this topic, the study has no specific focus on region and industry. In addition, this study only extracts papers that are published in English.

AB  - Blockchain technologies are increasingly recognized as a transformative force across industries, offering potential solutions for information management, data security, and operational efficiency improvement. However, integration into the healthcare sector faces significant barriers, ranging from technical challenges to organizational resistance. In this study, a methodology is proposed that examines these critical barriers through a comprehensive analysis of 3265 academic papers and derives actionable solutions from 1566 patents published between 2016 and 2023. This approach bridges the gap between identifying challenges and implementing solutions. Using the “Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)”, twelve critical adoption challenges are analyzed, while Top2Vec-based topic modeling identifies innovations that best address the ranked barriers. In addition to this, the proposed ‘healthcare ecosphere’ knowledge map serves as a comprehensive tool to analyze key stakeholders, their interactions, and the alignment of adoption barriers in solution spaces. The findings show that innovations in blockchain technologies are heavily concentrated in areas such as data security and application functionalities, whereas other critical domains—such as consensus mechanisms, governance, and regulatory frameworks—remain underexplored, pointing to opportunities for growth and development. The mapping of barriers to solutions provides practical guidance for healthcare providers, policymakers, and technologists seeking to implement the blockchain technologies effectively.
