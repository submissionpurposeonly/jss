AB  - Context
With the rising complexity and scale of software systems, there is an ever-increasing demand for sophisticated and cost-effective software testing. To meet such a demand, there is a need for a highly-skilled software testing work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address that need, many university educators worldwide have included software-testing education in their software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Many papers have been published in the last three decades (as early as 1992) to share experience from such undertakings.
Objective
Our objective in this paper is to summarize the body of experience and knowledge in the area of software-testing education to benefit the readers (both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing courses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research in this area.
Method
To address the above need, we conducted a systematic literature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what the community of educators have published on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204 papers published between 1992 and 2019.
Results
The topic of software-testing education is becoming more active, as we can see by the increasing number of papers. Many pedagogical approaches (how to best teach testing), course-ware, and specific tools for testing education have been proposed. Many challenges in testing education and insights on how to overcome those challenges have been proposed.
Conclusion
This paper provides educators and researchers with a classification of existing studies within software-testing education. We further synthesize challenges and insights reported when teaching software testing. The paper also provides a reference (“index”) to the vast body of knowledge and experience on teaching software testing. Our mapping study aims to help educators and researchers to identify the best practices in this area to effectively plan and deliver their software testing courses, or to conduct further education-research in this important area.

AB  - Summary
Background
Soil-transmitted helminths and Giardia duodenalis are responsible for a large burden of disease globally. In low-resource settings, household finished floors (eg, concrete floors) might reduce transmission of soil-transmitted helminths and G duodenalis.
Methods
In a prospective cohort of children nested within two randomised trials in rural Bangladesh and Kenya, we estimated associations between household finished flooring and soil-transmitted helminths and G duodenalis prevalence. In 2015–16, we collected stool samples from children aged 2–16 years in rural Bangladesh and Kenya. We detected soil-transmitted helminth infection using quantitative PCR (qPCR; Bangladesh n=2800; Kenya n=3094), and G duodenalis using qPCR in Bangladesh (n=6894) and ELISA in Kenya (n=8899). We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) using log-linear models adjusted for potential confounders.
Findings
7187 (92·2%) of 7795 children in Bangladesh and 9077 (93·7%) of 9686 children in Kenya provided stool specimens that were analysed by qPCR. At enrolment, 691 (10%) households in Bangladesh and 471 (5%) households in Kenya had finished floors. In both countries, household finished flooring was associated with lower Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence (Bangladesh aPR 0·33, 95% CI 0·14–0·78; Kenya 0·62, 0·39–0·98) and any soil-transmitted helminths (Bangladesh 0·73, 0·52–1·01; Kenya 0·57, 0·37–0·88). Household finished floors were also associated with lower Necator americanus prevalence in Bangladesh (0·52, 0·29–0·94) and G duodenalis prevalence in both countries (Bangladesh 0·78, 0·64–0·95; Kenya 0·82, 0·70–0·97).
Interpretation
In low-resource settings, living in households with finished floors over a 2-year period was associated with lower prevalence of G duodenalis and some soil-transmitted helminths in children.

AB  - Context:
Knowledge sharing is essential for collaboration and innovation in software development but is often hindered by barriers such as lack of motivation and information overload. Gamification has been proposed as a strategy to address these challenges by enhancing engagement and fostering collaboration.
Objective:
This study aimed to investigate the role of gamification in fostering knowledge sharing among software developers, focusing on gamification elements and solutions, the contexts and impacts of gamification, and the associated limitations.
Methods:
A Rapid Review methodology was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to ensure transparency and reproducibility. A systematic search of the Scopus database was performed in June 2024, yielding 1180 studies. After applying a six-stage selection process, including duplicate removal, title, and abstract screening, and full-text assessment based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included. Bias and quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), 2018 version. Key information was extracted and organized using the Parsifal tool to address three research questions.
Results:
Gamification significantly enhanced knowledge sharing by motivating participation, improving teamwork, and fostering positive behavioral changes. Common gamification elements included leaderboards, points, badges, and rewards, which were effective in promoting engagement. However, challenges such as superficial engagement, overemphasis on rewards, and difficulties in measuring long-term effectiveness were identified. Sustainable engagement strategies and robust evaluation frameworks were recommended to address these limitations.
Conclusions:
Gamification is a promising approach for overcoming barriers regarding knowledge-sharing in software development. Practitioners and researchers can leverage well-designed gamification mechanisms to create collaborative and innovative environments that enhance knowledge transfer and developer engagement. Future research should focus on sustainable strategies, tailored gamification approaches, and the development of robust metrics for evaluating gamification’s effectiveness. This review was not registered, and no external funding was received.

AB  - In this paper, our objective is to find a balanced trade-off between interpretability and accurate, reliable Issue classification-specifically Bug severity-by creating an ensemble Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodological approach that enhances software maintenance in Agile development environments. Using the TAWOS dataset, we explored the capabilities of state-of-the-art models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), integrated with advanced NLP techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction. Our results demonstrate that CatBoost achieved superior performance, with accuracies of 99. 61 % for ‘high’ labeled severity bugs, 97.73 % for ‘Critical’, and 97.65 % for ‘Blocker’. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis further identified key semantic descriptors, such as “crash” and “timeout,” as critical predictors in these models. Moreover, this research addresses a critical gap in software engineering by improving the precision and efficiency of bug triaging processes, thereby supporting more effective resource allocation and reducing costs in Agile software projects. Finally, the comprehensive preprocessing pipeline we developed, including lemmatization, outlier removal, and non-oversampling techniques, was essential in optimizing model performance, offering a robust framework for enhancing software quality assurance.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated cultural and organisational acceptance of remote working. For a portion of the commuting workforce, working from home (WFH) is now possible. Of great interest is whether increased WFH will diminish actual mobility, and thereby reduce the transport task of cities. To understand this possibility, we must know how much WFH will be sustained into the future. Using a bespoke approach combining scholarly and grey literature, this review develops a tangible record of employee desires and intentions to WFH, in the context of the expectations of employers. Its contribution is a novel and rigorous appraisal of recent practices and sentiments. Results confirm that there is a strong underlying demand to WFH. Many studies, however, estimate unrealistically high rates of WFH which cannot be projected onto the wider working population. Further, we find there is a conflict between employee preferences and their expectations to WFH, with estimations of preferences far greater than estimates of expectations. This finding is confirmed by the analysis of employer sentiments. Employers broadly realise that accommodating WFH reflects a best-practice approach, yet favour predictable routines where specific days of on-site attendance are mandated. We conclude with reflections on the impact of our findings on the transport system. We propose that the impact of WFH on commuter decision-making depends on the degree to which employers mandate on-site attendance. Finally, we emphasise the need to acknowledge the wider political, economic and social milieu in which work is performed as shaping future WFH practice.

KW  - Infection control
KW  - Prolonged drainage duration
AB  - Background
Pyogenic ventriculitis (PV) and intraventricular empyema (IVE) are severe intracranial infections with high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, there is no standardized treatment strategy for these conditions. Existing therapeutic approaches, including neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL), repeated external ventricular drainage (EVD), and long-tunneled EVD (LTEVD), each have their respective limitations.
Objective
Building on the theories of LTEVD, we developed the retroauricular external ventricular drainage (RaEVD) technique. This study aims to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of RaEVD in patients with PV and IVE.
Methods
RaEVD was performed under local anesthesia using a standard 10-Fr (3.3 mm) EVD catheter, with the distal exit positioned in the non-hair-bearing retroauricular region. This retrospective single-center study included seven patients (nine RaEVD procedures). Clinical outcomes, drainage duration, complications, and outcomes, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), were analyzed.
Results
The median drainage duration was 23 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 14-30 days). No catheter-related infections, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, or dislodgement occurred. The median mRS score improved from 4 (IQR, 4-5) preoperatively to 1 (IQR, 0-6) postoperatively. Five patients received ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS). Four patients (57.1%) achieved favorable outcomes (mRS 0-1). Two patients died (mortality rate: 28.6%).
Conclusion
RaEVD appears to be a safe and effective technique for managing PV and IVE, with potential advantages in prolonged drainage duration, catheter patency, and procedural simplicity. Future studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods are needed to further validate its effectiveness.

AB  - Background
The World Health Organization estimated a need for around 6 million nurses by 2030 to meet the healthcare demand. The International Council of Nurses reported that, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, the aging nursing workforce, and the high turnover of nurses were some of the factors that contributed to the anticipated 13 million nursing deficit. Globally, there is a worry about the high turnover with no doubt. The cost of turnover and recruitment incurred by healthcare organizations are huge which requires developing measures and interventions to address the problem. Nurse Residency Programs is a promising educational intervention for improving nurses' retention rates and reducing the impact of the shortage.
PICO question
What effect does successful completion of Nurse Residency Program have on new nurses’ retention rates compared with new nurses who missed the Nurse Residency Program?
Inclusion criteria
The review included articles; published in English, between 2016 and 2023 that addressed nurse retention rates, associated with Nurse Residency Program participation.
Methods
The systematic review followed the PRISMA protocol. An extensive search on the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, and PubMed for studies published between January 2016 and March 2023 in English language. The key words, ‘graduate nurses’, ‘new graduate nurses’, ‘residency’, ‘internships and residency’, ‘NRP’, ‘retention and retention rates’. Utilizing the JBI Sumari, two reviewers screened the citations, reviewed the eligibility criteria, conducted the critical appraisal, and assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non – randomized studies of intervention (ROBINS-I) tool was used to assess risk for bias.
Results
Out of 189 studies, 48 studies removed as duplicate, remaining with 141 article. After screening titles and abstracts, only 48 papers retrieved for full-text evaluation. Out of 48 research only 5 publications were included in the review. The researchers identified the methodological heterogeneity is a major factor to stop the metanalysis and keep the systematic review.
Conclusions
Nurse Residency Programs showed promise as an educational intervention to cultivate well-supported, competent, and confident new nurses. These programs have the potential to improve retention rates during the initial 12 months of employment. To gain a deeper understanding of retention beyond the first year, additional randomized control trials are essential. Furthermore, there is a need to integrate standardized Nurse Residency Programs into organizational policies and clinical practice settings in the UAE.

KW  - A/B test engineering
AB  - A/B testing, also referred to as online controlled experimentation or continuous experimentation, is a form of hypothesis testing where two variants of a piece of software are compared in the field from an end user’s point of view. A/B testing is widely used in practice to enable data-driven decision making for software development. While a few studies have explored different facets of research on A/B testing, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the state-of-the-art in A/B testing. Such a study is crucial to provide a systematic overview of the field of A/B testing driving future research forward. To address this gap and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in A/B testing, this paper reports the results of a systematic literature review that analyzed primary studies. The research questions focused on the subject of A/B testing, how A/B tests are designed and executed, what roles stakeholders have in this process, and the open challenges in the area. Analysis of the extracted data shows that the main targets of A/B testing are algorithms, visual elements, and workflow and processes. Single classic A/B tests are the dominating type of tests, primarily based in hypothesis tests. Stakeholders have three main roles in the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup technician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B tests are product/system data, user-centric data, and spatio-temporal data. The dominating use of the test results are feature selection, feature rollout, continued feature development, and subsequent A/B test design. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution: experiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems are related to the enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. From our study we derived three interesting lines for future research: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in A/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation of A/B testing.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
Primary results from the Optimize PRO study reported transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with cusp overlap technique (COT) resulting in low 30-day permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) rates and no ≥moderate aortic regurgitation (AR).
Objectives
To evaluate outcomes after Evolut FX implantation using the COT and postprocedural computed tomography (CT).
Methods
The Optimize PRO FX Addendum study is a post-market, prospective, multicenter non-randomized study. Patients with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR with Evolut FX using COT protocol. Postprocedurally, we evaluated COT adherence to identify key steps, and compared CT-assessed TAV orientation with fluoroscopically-guided commissural alignment.
Results
There were 151 patients implanted with Evolut FX from September 2022 to October 2023. Median duration of follow was 371 (Q1-Q3: 352-388) days. Compliance with the refined COT was 86.0%. Median length of stay was 1 day. The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or all stroke was 2.7% (95% CI: 1.0-6.9%) at 30 days and 7.5% (95% CI 4.2-13.1%) at 1 year. New PPI rate was 6.7% (95% CI 3.7-12.1%) at 30 days and 8.8% (95% CI 5.2-14.6%) at 1 year. One patient had moderate AR and none had severe AR at 1 year. Commissural alignment was 91.5% (107/117) when assessed by marker positioning on fluoroscopy and 86.9% (113/130) when assessed by CT, indicating good agreement. CT indicated no severe coronary misalignment in >92% of patients.
Conclusions
Evolut FX with a refined COT was associated with low PPI rates and no severe AR at 1 year. Postprocedural CT demonstrated consistent commissural and coronary alignment.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objective
To evaluate the prenatal detection of vasa previa (VP) and perinatal survival in studies that implemented standardized protocols of prospective second-trimester ultrasound screening protocols followed by ultrasound confirmation in the third trimester.
Data Sources
PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Global Health, and Global Index Medicus were searched from inception to February 16, 2024.
Study eligibility
We included cohort studies that implemented standardized second-trimester ultrasound protocols - either universal or targeted - for VP screening, with third-trimester ultrasound confirmation and verification at delivery, over at least one year. Eligible studies reported both the total number of pregnancies screened and the number of confirmed VP cases. Protocols included assessment of placental cord insertion, cervical region imaging, and transvaginal color Doppler in at-risk patients. We excluded first-trimester-only screening, case reports, reviews, conference abstracts, and overlapping populations.
Study appraisal and synthesis methods
Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analyses of sensitivity, specificity, and perinatal survival were conducted using fixed-effects models with inverse-variance weighting using R version 4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2024). Heterogeneity was assessed with chi-square, τ2, and I2 statistics. Sensitivity analyses excluded studies with high risk of bias. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s test.
Results
Of 1,817 publications, 19 met inclusion criteria, encompassing 779,845 pregnancies and 505 VP cases (1 in 1,544). Of these, 494 (97.8%) were diagnosed prenatally. The pooled sensitivity of standardized second-trimester ultrasound screening - with third-trimester confirmation - was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99-1.00; I2 = 0%), and specificity was also 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00-1.00; I2 = 0%), based on 774,937 pregnancies and 11 false positives. Perinatal survival among prenatally diagnosed cases ranged from 87.5% to 100%, with a pooled survival rate of 98.15% (95% CI: 88.30%-100.00%; I2 = 0%). Results remained consistent after excluding studies at high risk of bias. No evidence of publication bias was found.
Conclusions
Standardized screening for VP is associated with a high detection rate and high perinatal survival, with minimal false-positive and false-negative rates. These findings make a strong case for standardized screening for VP.

AB  - Developing modifiable natural products those having antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 is a key research area which is popular in current scenario of COVID pandemic. A diaryl heptanoid curcumin and its derivatives are already presenting promising candidates for anti-viral drug development. We have synthesized single crystals of a dimethylamino derivative of natural curcumin and structural characterization was done by single crystal XRD analysis. Using steady-state absorption and emission spectra and guided by complimentary ab initio calculations, we unraveled the solvent effects on the photophysical properties of the dimethyl amino curcumin derivative. Chemical reactivity of the compound has investigated using frontier molecular orbitals and molecular electrostatic potential surface. High stability of the curcumin derivative in water environment has evaluated by Radial Distributions Functions (RDF) calculated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The inhibitory activity of the title compound was evaluated by in silico methods and the stability of the protein-ligand complexes were studied using Molecular Dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA analysis. With this detailed study, we hope to motivate scientific community to develop new curcumin derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - Background
Treatment with methotrexate (MTX), often with concomitant glucocorticoids, is the cornerstone of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy. However, it may be less effective compared to (expensive) biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as tocilizumab (TCZ). Hitherto, the effectiveness and safety of MTX in combination with glucocorticoids have never been compared to TCZ with or without MTX.
Objectives
To compare effectiveness and safety of initiating TCZ, or TCZ with MTX (TCZ+MTX) to initiation of MTX with 10mg prednisone (MTX+Pred) all in a step-up treat-to-target treatment strategy in early RA patients.
Methods
Individual patient data of the U-Act-Early (n=317) and CAMERA-II (n=236) trials were used. Both were 2-year, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies evaluating step-up tight-control, treat-to-target treatment strategies with the opportunity to taper, in case of sustained remission, TCZ and/or MTX.1,2 Using MTX (n=108+119) as the reference strategy, TCZ+MTX (n=106) and TCZ (n=103) were compared with MTX+Pred (n=117): primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) over time. Secondary outcomes were remission, defined as DAS28<2.6, and the ConRew score (cumulative occurrence of remission and sustainment of remission). To assess the influence of acute phase reactants (APRs) on the results a disease activity outcome without APRs was also analysed (i.e. CDAI, modified due to lack of VAS physician in CAMERA-II). Multiple imputation was used for missing baseline data: HAQ, rheumatoid factor (RF) and smoking status. Multi-level models were used to account for clustering of patients within trials and for repeated measurements within patients over time. All models were corrected for baseline DAS28, HAQ, RF-status and smoking using fixed (and random) effects.
Results
Differences between U-Act-Early and CAMERA-II for RF seropositivity and DAS28 at baseline were observed; respectively 73% vs. 60% (p<0.01) and 5.2 vs. 5.7 (p=0.01). DAS28 was statistically significantly lower over time for TCZ+MTX compared to MTX+Pred (mean difference: -0.62 [95%CI -1.14 to -0.10]), but not for TCZ, Table 1. Remission occurred more often in TCZ+MTX and TCZ compared to MTX+Pred: relative risk 1.11 [95%CI 1.02 to 1.22] and 1.09 [1.00 to 1.20], respectively. ConRew scores were in line but not statistical significant different, Table 1. When using modified-CDAI, TCZ strategies did not show better control of disease activity over time than MTX+Pred (mean difference in log transformed values: TCZ+MTX vs. MTX+Pred: 0.10 [95%CI -0.16 to 0.36]; TCZ vs. MTX+Pred: 0.24 [95%CI -0.04 to 0.52]), Table 1. No differences in safety outcomes could be established, Table 2. 
Conclusion
In early RA patients, TCZ-based strategies resulted in better DAS28 over time compared to MTX+Pred, as well as higher percentage of remission, part of these effects may be due to a specific effect of TCZ on APRs.

AB  - Context
Continuous integration (CI) is a practice that aims to continuously verify quality aspects of a software intensive system both for functional and non-functional requirements (NFRs). Functional requirements are the inputs of development and can be tested in isolation, utilising either manual or automated tests. In contrast, some NFRs are difficult to test without functionality, for NFRs are often aspects of functionality and express quality aspects. Lacking this testability attribute makes NFR testing complicated and, therefore, underrepresented in industrial practice. However, the emergence of CI has radically affected software development and created new avenues for software quality evaluation and quality information acquisition. Research has, consequently, been devoted to the utilisation of this additional information for more efficient and effective NFR verification.
Objective
We aim to identify the state-of-the-art of utilising the CI environment for NFR testing, hereinafter referred to as CI-NFR testing.
Method
Through rigorous selection, from an initial set of 747 papers, we identified 47 papers that describe how NFRs are tested in a CI environment. Evidence-based analysis, through coding, is performed on the identified papers in this SLR.
Results
Firstly, ten CI approaches are described by the papers selected, each describing different tools and nine different NFRs where reported to be tested. Secondly, although possible, CI-NFR testing is associated with eight challenges that adversely affect its adoption. Thirdly, the identified CI-NFR testing processes are tool-driven, but there is a lack of NFR testing tools that can be used in the CI environment. Finally, we proposed a CI framework for NFRs testing.
Conclusion
A synthesised CI framework is proposed for testing various NFRs, and associated CI tools are also mapped. This contribution is valuable as results of the study also show that CI-NFR testing can help improve the quality of NFR testing in practices.

AB  - Version 13 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XtalOpt website, https://xtalopt.github.io. In the new version of the XtalOpt code, a general platform for multi-objective global optimization is implemented. This functionality is designed to facilitate the search for (meta)stable phases of functional materials through minimization of the enthalpy of a crystalline system coupled with the simultaneous optimization of any desired properties that are specified by the user. The code is also able to perform a constrained search by filtering the parent pool of structures based on a user-specified feature, while optimizing multiple objectives. Here, we present the implementation and various technical details, and we provide a brief overview of additional improvements that have been introduced in the new version of XtalOpt.
Program summary
Program Title: XtalOpt CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/jt5pvnnm39.4 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/xtalopt/XtalOpt Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause Programming language: C++. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun. 237 (2019) 274–275. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Reasons for the new version: Implementation of a multi-objective evolutionary search within the XtalOpt program package. Summary of revisions: Implemented a general user-friendly multi-objective search capability, made various improvements to user interface and functionalities, performed bug fixes. Nature of problem: The XtalOpt algorithm is designed to search for (meta)stable crystal structures, optionally with specific functionalities – a grand challenge in computational materials science, chemistry and physics. Solution method: A generalized scalar fitness function, where a set of user-specified objectives contribute to the fitness value for candidate structures, is implemented within XtalOpt. This generalized fitness biases the search towards the discovery of (meta)stable phases with structural motifs that are key for the desired characteristics. As a result, the evolutionary search explores regions of the energy landscape of higher relevance in terms of target properties.

AB  - Context
To reduce manual effort of extracting test cases from natural-language requirements, many approaches based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been proposed in the literature. Given the large amount of approaches in this area, and since many practitioners are eager to utilize such techniques, it is important to synthesize and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in this area.
Objective
Our objective is to summarize the state-of-the-art in NLP-assisted software testing which could benefit practitioners to potentially utilize those NLP-based techniques. Moreover, this can benefit researchers in providing an overview of the research landscape.
Method
To address the above need, we conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification). After compiling an initial pool of 95 papers, we conducted a systematic voting, and our final pool included 67 technical papers.
Results
This review paper provides an overview of the contribution types presented in the papers, types of NLP approaches used to assist software testing, types of required input requirements, and a review of tool support in this area. Some key results we have detected are: (1) only four of the 38 tools (11%) presented in the papers are available for download; (2) a larger ratio of the papers (30 of 67) provided a shallow exposure to the NLP aspects (almost no details).
Conclusion
This paper would benefit both practitioners and researchers by serving as an “index” to the body of knowledge in this area. The results could help practitioners utilizing the existing NLP-based techniques; this in turn reduces the cost of test-case design and decreases the amount of human resources spent on test activities. After sharing this review with some of our industrial collaborators, initial insights show that this review can indeed be useful and beneficial to practitioners.

AB  - Background
Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to offer solutions for automating many of the manual tasks involved in scientific reviews, including data extraction, literature screening, summarization, and quality assessment.
Objectives
This study aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the task of title and abstract screening and full-text data extraction of a scoping review study, by identifying their effectiveness, efficiency, and potential integration into human-based and manual tasks.
Materials and Method
The following key three steps of a scientific scoping review were automated: 1) Title and Abstract Screening, 2) Full-Text Screening, and 3) Data Extraction based on nine study dimensions. The four most recent lightweight open-source LLMs −Mistral, Vicuna, and Llama 3.2 with 1B and 3B parameters- were applied and evaluated through the steps.
Results
Llama 3.2-3B demonstrated the best performance in the title and abstract screening, achieving an accuracy of 66 %, excelling in the exclusion of papers. For full-text screening, it maintained the highest overall accuracy of 65 %, effectively identifying excluded papers. In data extraction, the Mistral model outperformed others across most dimensions, though Llama 3.2-3B excelled in extracting objectives and study implications.
Discussion and conclusion
The present study underscores both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating scoping reviews. Automating the entire scoping review without human intervention is sub-optimal. Using a more controlled approach balances the strengths of LLMs with the need for human judgment, supporting not only the replication of scientific reviews but also their continuous refinement and follow-up over time.

Paid sick leave (PSL) laws mandate employers give workers paid time off when they are sick or injured. This current study aims to examine whether access to PSL is associated with healthcare utilization and health outcomes and to summarize the types of utilization and outcomes which have been reported to be associated with PSL.
Methods
We conducted a rapid evidence review. Our search of seven databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, and JSTOR, on September 21, 2020, identified 757 studies, 30 of which were retained.
Results
Previous evidence is mostly provided by cross-sectional studies with survey data. In this study, evidence suggests that PSL is significantly associated with some types of healthcare utilization and health outcomes. In terms of healthcare utilization, findings indicate PSL is associated with an increase in the use of some preventive services and a decrease in the use of emergency care; while findings are mixed regarding associations of PSL with health provider visits and the use of mammograms and pap smears. As for health outcomes, findings suggest PSL is associated with improved mental and self-rated health, decreased incidence of influenza-like illness, and lower occupational injuries and mortality rates.
Conclusion
PSL may be an effective tool in improving some healthcare utilization and health outcomes. Future research could help identify mechanisms through which PSL access works and identify what policy components lead to better outcomes.

AB  - Software testing research has provided metrics on efficiency, error rates, and insights into the effectiveness of testing methodologies and tools. However, these tell only a part of the story. The qualitative dimension, which studies experiences, perceptions, and decision-making processes is crucial, but less prevalent in literature. This study aims to systematically map qualitative research in software testing to consolidate and categorize the methodologies used in qualitative testing research, highlight their importance, and identify patterns, gaps, and future directions. We conducted a systematic mapping study, identifying and analyzing 102 primary studies from 2003 to 2023. We categorized the studies according to research strategies, data collection, and data analysis methods. We identified case studies and grounded theory as the most prevalent research strategies. Researchers primarily used semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis to understand how practitioners work and gather stakeholder perspectives. The subject areas most covered by qualitative studies included software testing processes and risks, and test automation. Areas such as test oracles, and machine learning were underrepresented. We also assessed the quality of reporting and the methodological rigor, emphasizing the challenges and limitations identified during the process. Through this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of qualitative research practices in software testing, revealing trends, gaps, and methodological insights.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread all over the world, directly affecting the dentistry practice. This study aimed to perform a literature review about the current evidences on biosafety practices and clinical recommendations regarding the return to the elective dental care in the practice of Pediatric dentistry. An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Grey literature databases using the terms “Pediatric dentistry” and “COVID-19”. Initially, 38 studies were retrieved. After title and abstract were read, it was identified that 22 studies referred specifically to children's dental practice. A total of 19 studies were included in this study. The COVID-19 pandemic will imply significant changes in the reorientation of dental practices, from biosafety issues to technical procedures. Greater rigor in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) may cause strangeness for children. Consequently, an improvement in the management of patient's behavior before and during the treatment and new approaches to perform the procedures will be demanded. Non-aerosol techniques and minimally invasive procedures will be preferable whenever possible. Professionals will need to be constantly updated based on what the scientific literature recommends. The moment is suitable for the use of preventive practice and minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - Context:
Crowdsourced Software Engineering (CSE) offers outsourcing work to software practitioners by leveraging a global online workforce. However, these software practitioners struggle to identify suitable tasks due to the variety of options available. Hence, there have been a growing number of studies on introducing recommendation systems to recommend CSE tasks to software practitioners.
Objective:
The goal of this study is to analyze the existing CSE task recommendation systems, investigating their extracted data, recommendation methods, key advantages and limitations, recommended task types, the use of human factors in recommendations, popular platforms, and features used to make recommendations.
Methods:
This SLR was conducted according to the Kitchenham and Charters’ guidelines. We used manual and automatic search strategies without putting any time limitation for searching the relevant papers.
Results:
We selected 65 primary studies for data extraction, analysis, and synthesis based on our predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our data analysis results, we classified the extracted information into four categories according to the data acquisition sources: Software Practitioner’s Profile, Task or Project, Previous Contributions, and Direct Data Collection. We also organized the proposed recommendation systems into a taxonomy and identified key advantages, such as increased performance, accuracy, and optimized solutions. In addition, we identified the limitations of these systems, such as inadequate or biased recommendations and lack of generalizability. Our results revealed that human factors play a major role in CSE task recommendation. Further, we identified five popular task types recommended, popular platforms, and their features used in task recommendation. We also provided recommendations for future research directions.
Conclusion:
This SLR provides insights into current trends, gaps, and future research directions in CSE task recommendation systems such as the need for comprehensive evaluation, standardized evaluation metrics, and benchmarking in future studies, transferring knowledge from other platforms to address cold start problem.

AB  - Simulation models are a crucial enabling technology for decision support in the ongoing industrial digitalization hype. Within Industry 4.0, simulations are extensively utilized, providing insights into industrial behavior and responses. As we progress towards Industry 5.0, simulation models continue to play a pivotal role in achieving sustainable, resilient, and human-oriented industrial systems. However, a persistent challenge within Industry 4.0/5.0 is the substantial dynamism of industrial environments. This dynamic and complex landscape necessitates the development of adaptive solutions capable of swiftly responding to the volatile process requirements of modern industrial systems. To this end, Automatic Simulation Model Generation (ASMG) offers an innovative methodological framework to address this practical challenge in the development of industrial simulation models. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, this research systematically reviews the current state-of-the-art in ASMG. Complemented by a bibliometric and content analysis of 61 articles spanning more than two decades (from 2000 to 2023), the paper evaluates ASMG’s progression and application in manufacturing through four research questions focusing on ASMG development strategies, objectives, essential data, and developing environments. Ultimately, this article provides valuable insights into ASMG perspective for industrial simulation specialists and offers guidelines for future developments in the era of Industry 5.0.

AB  - High tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) levels in triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer are associated with better survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as prognostic biomarkers. Radiotherapy can also trigger immune cell infiltration. This systematic review evaluates the prognostic value of TILs in radiotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. A literature search (in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) was performed up to April 5, 2024 (PROSPERO registration CRD42024401741). Two independent reviewers screened articles according to predefined criteria, resolving discrepancies through consensus. The collected outcomes were prognostic value of TILs for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), any recurrence, distant metastasis (DM), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Of 10,927 records, 11 studies (3899 patients) were included. Patients underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy, with or without postoperative radiotherapy. Three studies examined neoadjuvant partial breast irradiation. The stroma threshold for high vs. low TILs ranged from 5 to 50%, with most patients (73%) having low TILs. Low TILs patients significantly benefited from radiotherapy in reducing IBTR and any recurrence. In luminal B, triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes, high TILs were associated with better outcomes in DM, OS and DFS. For radiotherapy-treated luminal A breast cancer, low TILs were associated with improved OS. For DCIS patients, low TILs correlated with reduced IBTR. TILs could be a prognostic biomarker for radiotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. However, study heterogeneity complicates comparisons. To refine personalized treatment, further prospective studies are necessary to investigate TILs levels and the impact of neoadjuvant radiotherapy on oncological outcomes across different breast cancer subtypes.

AB  - Background
Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are a serious complication after total joint arthroplasty. Our study aimed to analyze the characteristics and research highlights of the top 100 most cited studies on PJI from an orthopaedic standpoint. Moreover, we sought to assess whether there has been a change in the level of evidence (LOE) throughout time.
Methods
We conducted a search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify the top 100 studies primarily focusing on PJI. Study characteristics assessed included publication year, LOE, journal of publication, and type of study. Research highlights of the included studies were classified into 6 sections. Linear regression was employed to assess correlation between LOE and publication year.
Results
The aggregated citation count of all studies was 19,558 and the median citation number was 129.5. While cohort studies were the most prevalent, articles focusing on analysis of costs associated with PJI care or PJI definition garnered the highest yearly citation counts. The bulk of included studies were concentrated in 3 orthopaedic journals and published in the 2010s. The majority of studies had a LOE II (30%) or III (34%). On regression analysis, LOE was not correlated with publication year (Pearson’s r = 0.013, P = .61).
Conclusions
The most cited PJI articles assessed the definition of PJI and PJI cost. Despite growing interest in PJI, the majority of studies had LOE II or III, highlighting the difficulty of conducting prospective randomized controlled trials in PJI patients.

AB  - Household appliances account for a large proportion of the e-waste generated worldwide each year. Up to 75 % of this waste is currently incinerated or landfilled. The recycling industry focuses on harvesting valuable parts, like metals; however, household appliances are not only made of metals, but also recyclable plastics. This article reviews how the recycling of these plastics has developed since 2014 and which new approaches, such as ecodesign, currently are being pursued to promote the recycling of (plastic parts in) household appliances in the future. The findings of the present review paper show that the consideration of recycling is extending to the life cycle of products over time; however, a holistic approach is still lacking, and although problems such as the recycling of plastics containing flame retardants are known, the latter are still not being considered in the product development phase. Other challenges, which already existed 10 years ago, such as those posed by the illegal sector, are still in focus today. Conversely, there are many ideas, like material tracking, incentive systems or microfactory treatment, on how the recycling of (plastic from) household appliances can be improved in the future, which necessitate further research.

AB  - Background
A large language model is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that opens up great possibilities for health care practice, research, and education, although scholars have emphasized the need to proactively address the issue of unvalidated and inaccurate information regarding its use. One of the best-known large language models is ChatGPT (OpenAI). It is believed to be of great help to medical research, as it facilitates more efficient data set analysis, code generation, and literature review, allowing researchers to focus on experimental design as well as drug discovery and development.
Objective
This study aims to explore the potential of ChatGPT as a real-time literature search tool for systematic reviews and clinical decision support systems, to enhance their efficiency and accuracy in health care settings.
Methods
The search results of a published systematic review by human experts on the treatment of Peyronie disease were selected as a benchmark, and the literature search formula of the study was applied to ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing AI as a comparison to human researchers. Peyronie disease typically presents with discomfort, curvature, or deformity of the penis in association with palpable plaques and erectile dysfunction. To evaluate the quality of individual studies derived from AI answers, we created a structured rating system based on bibliographic information related to the publications. We classified its answers into 4 grades if the title existed: A, B, C, and F. No grade was given for a fake title or no answer.
Results
From ChatGPT, 7 (0.5%) out of 1287 identified studies were directly relevant, whereas Bing AI resulted in 19 (40%) relevant studies out of 48, compared to the human benchmark of 24 studies. In the qualitative evaluation, ChatGPT had 7 grade A, 18 grade B, 167 grade C, and 211 grade F studies, and Bing AI had 19 grade A and 28 grade C studies.
Conclusions
This is the first study to compare AI and conventional human systematic review methods as a real-time literature collection tool for evidence-based medicine. The results suggest that the use of ChatGPT as a tool for real-time evidence generation is not yet accurate and feasible. Therefore, researchers should be cautious about using such AI. The limitations of this study using the generative pre-trained transformer model are that the search for research topics was not diverse and that it did not prevent the hallucination of generative AI. However, this study will serve as a standard for future studies by providing an index to verify the reliability and consistency of generative AI from a user’s point of view. If the reliability and consistency of AI literature search services are verified, then the use of these technologies will help medical research greatly.

The evidence for the prevalence of test smells at the unit testing level has relied on the accuracy of detection tools, which have seen intense research in the last two decades. The Eager Test smell, one of the most prevalent, is often identified using simplified detection rules that practitioners find inadequate.
Objective:
We aim to improve the rules for detecting the Eager Test smell.
Methods:
We reviewed the literature on test smells to analyze the definitions and detection rules of the Eager Test smell. We proposed a novel, unambiguous definition of the test smell and a heuristic to address the limitations of the existing rules. We evaluated our heuristic against existing detection rules by manually applying it to 300 unit test cases in Java.
Results:
Our review identified 56 relevant studies. We found that inadequate interpretations of original definitions of the Eager Test smell led to imprecise detection rules, resulting in a high level of disagreement in detection outcomes. Also, our heuristic detected patterns of eager and non-eager tests that existing rules missed.
Conclusion:
Our heuristic captures the essence of the Eager Test smell more precisely; hence, it may address practitioners’ concerns regarding the adequacy of existing detection rules.

AB  - In a global environment that continues to challenge organizations' responsiveness, agile teams have proliferated in diverse sectors of practice and streams of research. However, scholars also indicate that agile teams, their way of working, and how they achieve effectiveness seem to be an undertheorized phenomenon. To better account for and understand how agile teams reach effectiveness, we aim to compile, organize, and synthesize the agile team literature using the IMOI model as a theoretical anchoring point. We systematically reviewed 74 studies on agile teams and identified their key input, mediating, and outcome factors. This effort has, consequently, allowed us to identify crucial theoretical and methodological gaps in the understanding of how agile teams manage uncertainty and what is needed to close these gaps. Furthermore, we identified three themes relevant to all teams dealing with the management of uncertainty.

AB  - Context
Software testability is the degree to which a software system or a unit under test supports its own testing. To predict and improve software testability, a large number of techniques and metrics have been proposed by both practitioners and researchers in the last several decades. Reviewing and getting an overview of the entire state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in this area is often challenging for a practitioner or a new researcher.
Objective
Our objective is to summarize the body of knowledge in this area and to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) in preparing, measuring and improving software testability.
Method
To address the above need, the authors conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification) to find out what we as a community know about this topic. After compiling an initial pool of 303 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 208 papers (published between 1982 and 2017).
Results
The area of software testability has been comprehensively studied by researchers and practitioners. Approaches for measurement of testability and improvement of testability are the most-frequently addressed in the papers. The two most often mentioned factors affecting testability are observability and controllability. Common ways to improve testability are testability transformation, improving observability, adding assertions, and improving controllability.
Conclusion
This paper serves for both researchers and practitioners as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in the area of testability. The results could help practitioners measure and improve software testability in their projects. To assess potential benefits of this review paper, we shared its draft version with two of our industrial collaborators. They stated that they found the review useful and beneficial in their testing activities. Our results can also benefit researchers in observing the trends in this area and identify the topics that require further investigation.

AB  - Model Driven Architecture (MDA) has earned a prominent place in Software Engineering. However, while the application of MDA in software industry has grown, its impact in industry is not being as fast and broad as predicted. Moreover, the emerging use of agile methods have had an effect on the interest of industry and academics on developing software using metamodels. As a result, it is difficult to establish the true interest of practicioners about code generation using model driven architectures. This study investigates the scientific evidence of model driven architecture by conducting a systematic mapping of MDA literature in software engineering between 2008 and 2018. The search strategy resulted in 2.145 studies, of which 50 were identified as primary articles relevant to this study. We have verified that there is a considerable number of research articles that make use of MDA, published in a variety of journals, congresses and workshops, referred to very varied fields of application, and this number of publications seems to be increasing. The study also shows that, while there are few relevant publications that specifically deal with code generation using MDA, most of them show how this technology can be applied successfully to enhance software development.

KW  - Case study
AB  - Context
Specification mining techniques are typically used to extract the specification of a software in the absence of (up-to-date) specification documents. This is useful for program comprehension, testing, and anomaly detection. However, specification mining can also potentially be used for debugging, where a faulty behavior is abstracted to give developers a context about the bug and help them locating it.
Objective
In this project, we investigate this idea in an industrial setting. We propose a very basic semi-automated specification mining approach for debugging and apply that on real reported issues from an AutoPilot software system from our industry partner, MicroPilot Inc. The objective is to assess the feasibility and usefulness of the approach in a real-world setting.
Method
The approach is developed as a prototype tool, working on C code, which accept a set of relevant state fields and functions, per issue, and generates an extended finite state machine that represents the faulty behavior, abstracted with respect to the relevant context (the selected fields and functions).
Results
We qualitatively evaluate the approach by a set of interviews (including observational studies) with the company’s developers on their real-world reported bugs. The results show that (a) our approach is feasible, (b) it can be automated to some extent, and (c) brings advantages over only using their code-level debugging tools. We also compared this approach with traditional fully automated state-merging algorithms and reported several issues when applying those techniques on a real-world debugging context.
Conclusion
The main conclusion of this study is that the idea of an “interactive” specification mining rather than a fully automated mining tool is NOT impractical and indeed is useful for the debugging use case.

AB  - Context: The popular agile practices of continuous integration and delivery have become an essential part of the software development process in many companies, yet effective methods and tools to support design, description and communication of continuous integration and delivery systems are lacking. Objective: The work reported on in this paper addresses that lack by presenting Cinders — an architecture framework designed specifically to meet the needs of such systems, influenced both by prominent enterprise and software architecture frameworks as well as experiences from continuous integration and delivery modeling in industry. Method: The state of the art for systematic design and description of continuous integration and delivery systems is established through review of literature, whereupon a proposal for an architecture framework addressing requirements derived from continuous integration and delivery modeling experiences is proposed. This framework is subsequently evaluated through interviews and workshops with engineers in varying roles in three independent companies. Results: Cinders, an architecture framework designed specifically for the purpose of describing continuous integration and delivery systems is proposed and confirmed to constitute an improvement over previous methods. This work presents software professionals with a demonstrably effective method for describing their continuous integration and delivery systems from multiple points of view and supporting multiple use-cases, including system design, communication and documentation. Conclusion: It is concluded that an architecture framework for the continuous integration and delivery domain has value; at the same time potential for further improvement is identified, particularly in the area of tool support for data collection as well as for manual modeling.

AB  - Context:
Machine learning software defect prediction is a promising field of software engineering, attracting a great deal of attention from the research community; however, its industry application tents to lag behind academic achievements.
Objective:
This study is part of a larger project focused on improving the quality and minimising the cost of software testing of the 5G system at Nokia, and aims to evaluate the business applicability of machine learning software defect prediction and gather lessons learnt.
Methods:
The systematic literature review was conducted on journal and conference papers published between 2015 and 2022 in popular online databases (ACM, IEEE, Springer, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). A quasi-gold standard procedure was used to validate the search, and SEGRESS guidelines were used for transparency, reporting, and replicability.
Results:
We have selected and analysed 32 publications out of 397 found by our automatic search (and seven by snowballing). We have identified highly relevant evidence of methods, features, frameworks, and datasets used. However, we found a minimal emphasis on practical lessons learnt and cost consciousness — both vital from a business perspective.
Conclusion:
Even though the number of machine learning software defect prediction studies validated in the industry is increasing (and we were able to identify several excellent papers on studies performed in vivo), there is still not enough practical focus on the business aspects of the effort that would help bridge the gap between the needs of the industry and academic research.

AB  - Initially, smart home technology gained traction for its aesthetic appeal, functionality, and allure to early tech enthusiasts. Today, it plays a crucial role in enhancing security, healthcare, and energy management. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, smart homes offer increased convenience and automation. Yet, concerns over privacy, data security, and ethical use have grown. This study leverages social media analytics to analyze a longitudinal dataset of over 150,000 tweets from Australia between 2016 and 2023, using quantitative, sentiment, and content analysis. The goal is to investigate the evolving public discourse around smart home technologies, focusing on user key concerns. A novel insight from the study reveals a rising awareness and demand for responsible practices in the development and deployment of smart home technologies, which may influence user adoption intentions and behaviors. This suggests a potential shift in user priorities from seeking functionality and convenience to becoming more concerned with ethical standards and responsible use. The study makes a novel contribution as it identifies a new trend in public discourse that extends beyond the traditional drivers of smart home technology adoption. By capturing these dynamics, this paper provides critical insights for stakeholders—particularly in the smart home industry and regulatory sectors—to inform the development of more responsible, user-centered products and policies.

AB  - Asset securitization is an important financial derivative involving complicated asset transfer operations. Therefore, digitizing traditional asset securitization contracts will improve efficiency and facilitate reliability verification. Furthermore, accurate and verifiable requirement description is essential for collaborative development between financial professionals and software engineers. A domain specific language for writing asset securitization contract has been proposed. This solves the problem of difficulty for financial professionals to directly write smart contract by simplifying writing rules. However, due to existing design of the language focused on some simple scenarios, it is insufficient and informal to describe various detailed scenarios. What is more, there are still many reliability issues, such as verifying the correctness of the logical properties of the contract and ensuring the consistency between the contract text and the contract code, within the language in the generation and execution of smart contracts. To overcome the challenges stated above, we extend, simplify and innovate the syntax subset of the domain specific language and name it AS-SC (Asset Securitization – Smart Contract), which can be used by financial professionals to accurately describe requirements. Besides, because formal methods are math-based techniques that describe system properties and can generate programs in a more formal and reliable manner, we propose a semantic consistent code conversion method, named AS2EB, for converting from AS-SC to Event-B, a common and useful formal language. AS2EB method can be used by software engineers to verify requirements. The combination of AS-SC and AS2EB ensures consistency and reliability of the requirements, and reduces the cost of repeated communications and later testing. Taking the credit asset securitization contract as case study, the feasibility and rationality of AS-SC and AS2EB are validated. In addition, by carrying out experiments on three randomly selected real cases in different classic scenarios, we show high-efficiency and reliability of AS2EB method.

AB  - Agent-based models (ABMs) offer promise for realistically simulating human behaviours and interactions during emergency evacuations. This review aims to systematically assess the state of the art in ABM-based evacuation modelling with respect to methodologies, validation practices, and the associated challenges over the past decade. The review critically examines 134 studies from 2013 to 2023 that have applied ABMs for pedestrian evacuation simulation to synthesise current capabilities, limitations, and advancement pathways. Findings identify persistent challenges related to modeller bias, computational complexity, data scarcity for calibration and validation, and the predominance of simplistic rule-based decision-making models, while promise exists with the adoption of flexible behavioural frameworks, high-performance computing architectures, machine learning techniques for adaptive agent behaviours and surrogate modelling, and evolutionary computation methods for transparent rule generation. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among behavioural scientists, modellers, and emergency planners to enhance the realism and reliability of ABMs. By providing a critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art and proposing future research directions, this review aims to accelerate the development and application of ABMs that can meaningfully enhance the safety and resilience of communities facing emergencies.

AB  - Software development is a complex phenomenon that requires software teams to integrate diverse knowledge and expertise to provide innovative solutions. A critical success factor for software teams is their integrative learning capability which is driven by multiple factors. We systematically review and synthesize extant literature to identify critical antecedents of integrative learning in software teams and uncover knowledge gaps to inform future research. Searching multiple databases, 447 papers were identified, of which 32 were selected for the final analysis after a rigorous data extraction process. We performed open and axial coding and affinity diagramming to thematically analyze each study for antecedents associated with integrative learning. We also triangulated our results by content analyzing the studies using a software-based text analysis tool. The findings indicate five crucial drivers of integrative learning in software teams: social harmony, process agility, team design, technological maturity, and project environment. The study also highlights the value of recognizing the inter-team and intra-team contexts in team learning. Based on the study findings, we propose a model of integrative learning in software teams, discuss future research agendas, and offer practical insights and recommendations to software professionals.

AB  - Background
Digital self-help interventions (including online or computerized programs and apps) for common mental health issues have been shown to be appealing, engaging, and efficacious in randomized controlled trials. They show potential for improving access to therapy and improving population mental health. However, their use in the real world, ie, as implemented (disseminated) outside of research settings, may differ from that reported in trials, and implementation data are seldom reported.
Objective
This study aimed to review peer-reviewed articles reporting user uptake and/or ongoing use, retention, or completion data (hereafter usage data or, for brevity, engagement) from implemented pure self-help (unguided) digital interventions for depression, anxiety, or the enhancement of mood.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search of the Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases for studies reporting user uptake and/or usage data from implemented digital self-help interventions for the treatment or prevention of depression or anxiety, or the enhancement of mood, from 2002 to 2017. Additionally, we screened the reference lists of included articles, citations of these articles, and the titles of articles published in Internet Interventions, Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), and JMIR Mental Health since their inception. We extracted data indicating the number of registrations or downloads and usage of interventions.
Results
After the removal of duplicates, 970 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Hand searching identified 1 additional article. The included articles reported on 7 publicly available interventions. There was little consistency in the measures reported. The number of registrants or downloads ranged widely, from 8 to over 40,000 per month. From 21% to 88% of users engaged in at least minimal use (eg, used the intervention at least once or completed one module or assessment), whereas 7-42% engaged in moderate use (completing between 40% and 60% of modular fixed-length programs or continuing to use apps after 4 weeks). Indications of completion or sustained use (completion of all modules or the last assessment or continuing to use apps after six weeks or more) varied from 0.5% to 28.6%.
Conclusions
Available data suggest that uptake and engagement vary widely among the handful of implemented digital self-help apps and programs that have reported this, and that usage may vary from that reported in trials. Implementation data should be routinely gathered and reported to facilitate improved uptake and engagement, arguably among the major challenges in digital health.

AB  - Tension leg platform (TLP) floating wind turbines (FWTs) represent a promising frontier in the research and development of the offshore wind industry. The recent completion of the first TLP floating wind farm, Provence Grand Large, marks a significant milestone. Compared to other FWT designs, TLP FWTs have advantages in motion dynamics and structural utilization, leading to improved performance and reduced cost. However, their unique physical characteristics require specialized design considerations and innovative solutions for practical implementation. To facilitate the development of next-generation TLP FWTs, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review focused on various design aspects: development, technical challenges, requirements, innovative concepts, and research methods. An overview is provided, detailing key design parameters of existing TLP FWTs, such as weight, displacement, installed capacity, and the natural period of motion. Additionally, the design challenges of TLP FWTs are summarized. Afterwards, the TLP FWT designs are classified and critically reviewed, highlighting the design features and installation methods of innovative concepts while identifying development trends in the field. Then, numerical and experimental methods for design are discussed, along with current research gaps. Finally, this paper presents four key areas for future research on TLP FWTs.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
The direct link between poor palatability and non-adherence is well-documented. It is essential to assess which medicines are known to be poorly tolerated due to taste, find alternatives that may be more palatable, and highlight home taste-masking interventions to mitigate poor palatability.
Objective
To increase awareness about medicine palatability, we created the Ew Meds ListTM - a comprehensive list of bad-tasting oral liquid medicines and evidence-based recommendations to mask poor palatability.
Methods
EMBASE searches were conducted using the terms child, bitter, flavor, masking, and adherence. Articles containing scored medicine taste perception were used to rank medicines to assess eligibility for the Ew Meds List TM. All scales were aligned to a 5-point Likert scale with 1 being “dislike it very much” and 5 being “like it very much”. Medicines scoring less than 2.5 were added to Ew MedsTM. Medicines scoring 2.5 and above were added to “Better Tasting Meds”. Studies with taste-masking evidence related to specific medicines were used to create evidence-based taste-masking recommendations. Pharmaceutics literature provided flavoring recommendations to mask basic taste properties, like bitter or sour.
Results
Twenty articles contained ranked taste perceptions for 32 medicines. Of those, 18 met criteria as Ew MedsTM, and 14 for better-tasting meds. Eleven medicines had evidence-based masking recommendations. Additional sections were created to address common taste masking recommendations and food science flavor masking techniques.
Conclusion
Pharmacists can make medicines more manageable for children by using the guidance provided in the Ew Meds ListTM to improve the palatability of oral liquid medicines, recommend taste masking, or use better-tasting medicines when available. Research is needed to expand this list and document the efficacy of common taste masking practices.

AB  - Approaches to Automatic Text Summarization try to extract key information from one or more input texts and generate summaries whilst preserving content meaning. These strategies are separated into two groups, Extractive and Abstractive, which differ in their work. The extractive summarization extracts sentences from the document text directly, whereas the abstractive summarization creates a summary by interpreting the text and rewriting sentences, often with new words. It is important to assess and confirm how similar a summary is to the original text independently of the particular TS algorithm adopted. The literature proposes various metrics and scores for evaluating text summarization results, and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation) is the most used. In this study, our main objective is to evaluate how the ROUGE metric performs when applied to both Extractive and Abstractive summarization algorithms. We aim to understand its effectiveness and reliability as an independent and unbiased metric in assessing the quality of summaries generated by these different approaches. We conducted a first experiment to compare the metric efficiency (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L) for evaluating Abstractive (word2vec, doc2vec, and glove) versus Extractive Text Summarization algorithms (textRank, lsa, luhn, lexRank), and a second one to compare the obtained score for two different summary approaches: a simple execution of a summarization algorithm versus a multiple execution of different algorithms on the same text. Based on our study, evaluating the ROUGE metric for Abstractive and Extractive algorithms revealed that it reaches similar results for the Abstractive and Extractive algorithms. Moreover, our findings indicate that multiple executions, based on the running of two text summarization algorithms sequentially on the same text, generally outperform single executions of a single text summarization algorithm.

AB  - As Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows are becoming very relevant for the different stages of the project’s lifecycle, more data is produced and managed across it. The information and data accumulated in BIM-based projects present an opportunity for analysis and extraction of project knowledge from the inception to the operation phase. In other industries, Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to automate processes and extract useful insights from different types and sources of data. The rapid development of ML applications, the growing generation of BIM-related data in projects, and the different needs for use of this data present serious challenges to adopt and effectively apply ML techniques to BIM-based projects in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry. While research on the use of BIM data through ML has increased in the past decade, it is still in a nascent stage. In order to asses where the industry stands today, this paper carries out a systematic literature review (SLR) identifying and summarizing common emerging areas of application and utilization of ML within the context of BIM-generated data. Moreover, the paper identifies research gaps and trends. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on information architecture and data, applications scalability, and human information interactions.

AB  - General discussion around artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be mostly concerned about potential benefits or hazards. While AI excels in automating basic and simple repetitive tasks, this is not a synonym for creativity, nor ethically sustainable unless the role is simple. Machine learning, deep learning and AI are trendy phenomena. However, the ethicality and credibility of the usage of AI in Technology-assisted literature reviews are raising questions. A systematic literature review was conducted to the SCOPUS database and Google Search. The PRISMA framework was used for the literature review. It was explored how AI is used to conduct -or assist in literature reviews. The results indicate that different scientific fields discuss issues relating to biases in AI technology and there is no consensus about what keywords and definitions should be to describe the same issue. AI has its place in the methodology of literature reviews, and this methodology continues to develop, but there are unsolved issues that how to create a tool with minimal bias and understand the current limitations of the technology of artificial intelligence. The empirical observation is that there are no specified keywords for the articles which relate to artificial intelligence-assisted literature reviews, which creates limitations for the generalisability of the results of this systematic literature review. Thus, this study has made several basic discoveries during this systematic literature review and their results are discussed. AI still poses bias risk and AI assisted literature reviews cannot be reliable without human supervision and there is no consensus on how AI assisted literature reviews should be classified in keywords and titles. It remains an open question whether there are any more hidden qualitative hypotheses in the development of reliability and validity of AI technology, which are waiting for discovery.

AB  - Intense competition in the mobile apps market means it is important to maintain high levels of app reliability to avoid losing users. Yet despite its importance, app reliability is underexplored in the research literature. To address this need, we identify, analyse, and classify the state-of-the-art in the field of mobile apps’ reliability through a systematic mapping study. From the results of such a study, researchers in the field can identify pressing research gaps, and developers can gain knowledge about existing solutions, to potentially leverage them in practice. We found 87 relevant papers which were then analysed and classified based on their research focus, research type, contribution, research method, study settings, data, quality attributes and metrics used. Results indicate that there is a lack of research on understanding reliability with regard to context-awareness, self-healing, ageing and rejuvenation, and runtime event handling. These aspects have rarely been studied, or if studied, there is limited evaluation. We also identified several other research gaps including the need to conduct more research in real-world industrial projects. Furthermore, little attention has been paid towards quality standards while conducting research. Outcomes here show numerous opportunities for greater research depth and breadth on mobile app reliability.

AB  - Autonomous and cooperative elements of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) rely on the interconnection of digital and physical components to enable intelligent and profitable production processes. However, this interconnectedness increases system complexity, heterogeneity, and unpredictability. To address these interactions, decrease complexity, and enhance resilience within such systems, identifying the appropriate Design Parameters (DPs) is crucial. DPs are solutions that fulfill higher-level Functional Requirements (FRs) in the design of CPPSs. Despite numerous literature on CPPSs, less attention has been given to exploring resilience-related FRs and corresponding DPs. This paper presents a comprehensive review to identify and categorize the DPs discussed in the scientific literature that enhance CPPSs resilience. The identified DPs are classified into physical and digital solutions and an integration of both. The findings indicate that the Industrial Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twins are the most implemented DPs to fulfill FRs, thereby providing resilience capabilities in CPPSs.

AB  - Background
Running is practiced worldwide, but more than 50 % of runners suffer some form of musculoskeletal injury each year. Biomechanics of running is an important aspect of sports medicine and gait analysis is central in the study of running mechanics for prevention of injuries and enhancing performance.
Objectives
The purpose of this systematic literature review is to Saragiotto et al. (2014 Apr 4) 1 assess the methods employed in conducting gait analysis studies from 2020 to 2024, 2 discuss spatiotemporal characteristics, bilateral asymmetry, and RRI, (Lenhart et al., 2014 Mar) 3 present wearable technology, and (Willson et al., 2014) 4 provide recommendations for future research and application based on the findings.
Methods
The study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database under the number CRD42024572642. The systematic search of articles was performed in the Scopus database, considering the articles written in English and published in journals between 2004 and 2024, which are focused on the analysis of running gait. Data were collected, pre-processed, and processed according to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results
Of 2175 articles, only 43 studies were included. The studies were mainly concerned with spatiotemporal features (Patino and Ferreira, 2018) ,16 gait asymmetry and injuries (Crowther et al., 2007 Jun 1) ,9 biomechanics (Mason et al., 2023 Sep 1) ,8 and gait measurement tools (Schubert et al., 2014 May 1) .10 IMUs, accelerometers, and pressure sensors were established as wearable technologies that can be used to monitor gait in the sports setting.
Conclusion
In this review, we discuss the latest developments in wearable technology for gait analysis, which can be considered a viable alternative to laboratory-based methods. However, the need to use standard methods and validation procedures has not lost its importance as it is crucial for the practical application of these technologies.

KW  - Viral community-acquired pneumonia
KW  - Southeast Asia
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, including in Southeast Asia (SEA). While bacterial causes are well studied, viral etiologies are less characterized. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significance of viral pneumonia, alongside ongoing concerns from zoonotic influenza, human metapneumovirus, and other outbreaks. This review identified 16 studies from SEA, encompassing 8421 CAP patients (2012-2023), describing the viral etiology of CAP. Influenza virus (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV/EV) were the most frequently tested viral pathogens in 16, 13, and 12 studies, respectively. The pooled positivity rates were 9.02% (hRV/EV), 7.28% (IV), and 5.17% (RSV). While viral etiologies of CAP in SEA align with global trends, data remain limited. Enhancing microbiology capacity in SEA is essential to strengthen CAP surveillance, optimize treatment strategies, inform vaccination policies, and improve pandemic preparedness.

KW  - Explainable AI
KW  - Machine learning
AB  - Context:
Software defect prediction is crucial for prioritising quality assurance tasks, however, there are still limitations to the use of defect models. For example, the outputs often do not provide the defect type, severity, or the cause of the defect. Current models are also often complex in implementation (they use low transparency classifiers such as random forest or support vector machines) and primarily output binary predictions. They lack directly actionable outputs, that is, outputs that provide additional information (e.g., defect severity or defect type) to aid in fixing the defect. One approach is to utilise tools of explainable AI.
Objective:
In order to improve current models and plan the direction for explainability in software defect prediction, we need to understand how explainable current models are.
Methods:
Starting from 861 papers from multiple databases, we investigated a sample of 132 papers in a systematic literature review. We extracted the following information to answer our research questions: (i) information about the outputs (e.g., how informative they were) and explainability methods used, (ii) how explainability and performance is measured and (iii) explainability in future research. Our results were summarised by manually labelling the data so that trends could be analysed across selected papers, along with a thematic analysis.
Results:
We found that 71% of current models used binary outputs, while 68% of models were not yet utilising any explainability techniques. Only 7% of studies considered explainability in their future research suggestions.
Conclusion:
There is still a lack of awareness among researchers for the need for explainability and motivation to invest further research into more explainable and more informative software defect prediction models.

AB  - Maritime industry plays a critical role in global trade and is currently faced with the urgent need for decarbonization to address climate change and environmental degradation. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in ship emission estimation studies, particularly focusing on academic literature with automatic identification system (AIS) data as the major data source. Our comprehensive review covers 78 academic publications from 2009 to 2024. The research data status, ship emission estimation and validation methods, analysis of emission outcomes, potential impacts, and feasible countermeasures of these studies are extensively summarized and discussed. We find significant gaps in research data availability, especially the detailed engine and emissions records. Methodological issues arise from the oversimplification of maritime operations in current studies driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and inadequate models for in-port emissions estimation and fuel switching dynamics. We also discuss evaluation challenges, including the lack of real ship emission data and the difficulties in differentiating between maritime and urban emissions in coastal areas. To improve current data condition, we recommend improving data collection procedure with enhanced monitoring technologies and adapting new multi-source data fusion techniques like transfer learning. AI-driven methodologies should be enhanced with domain knowledge to adapt varying maritime contexts. We also propose a generic structure of open-source maritime database and encourage building collaborative data-sharing system to promote partnerships across various sectors for emission tracking, analysis, and mitigation.

KW  - Disease modifying treatments
AB  - Background
The Coronavirus 19 pandemic has raised new relevant questions regarding the management of patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) treated with different immunosuppressive and immunomodulant drugs. In most COVID-19 outcomes analyses, due to the small available sample size, patients treated with cladribine were grouped with patients treated with other treatments.
Methods
Three major databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) and the most recent MS congress libraries were searched for extracting original articles on COVID-19 and multiple sclerosis. The key inclusion criteria were the presence of data on pwMS treated with cladribine and with documented positivity for COVID-19. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using a modified version of the Dutch Cochrane center critical review checklist proposed by MOOSE. A common-effect meta-analysis was used for estimating the pooled proportion of patients with severe events (hospitalizations, pneumonia, ICU admissions and deaths) and heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 statistic.
Results
13 articles were included in the analysis and the median quality of the articles reached a level of 4. The selected studies included 5138 patients with COVID-19, of whom 107 (2.1%) were treated with cladribine. Pooled estimates of hospitalization and death were 9.36% and 0% for patients treated with cladribine, 14.98% and 2.66% for pwMS under other treatments.
Conclusion
These results indicate that pwMS treated with cladribine are not at a greater risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19.
Registration
The protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022329464),

AB  - Background
Systematic reviews (SRs) worldwide suffer from methodological deficiencies, potentially biasing intervention decisions, and Peruvian SRs are no exception. Evaluating SRs led by Peruvian researchers is a crucial step to enhance quality and transparency in decision-making and to identify topics where SRs are either scarce or prioritized for research.
Objective
To describe the characteristics and assess the methodological quality of SRs with Peruvian first authors.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review within the Scopus database on January 5, 2023. We aimed to identify published SRs of interventions in which the first author had a Peruvian affiliation, published between 2013 and 2022. We evaluated the methodological quality of these SRs using the AMSTAR 2 tool. We assessed the factors associated with the AMSTAR 2 score using adjusted mean differences (aMD), including their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI).
Results
We identified 95 eligible SRs, with a clear upward trend. SRs were primarily published in Q1 (43.2 %) and Q2 (23.2 %) journals, predominantly affiliated with institutions in Lima (90.5 %). Areas like infectious diseases (20.0 %) and dentistry (18.9 %) were most frequent. AMSTAR 2 assessments highlighted deficiencies, with few SRs reporting prior protocols (37.9 %), comprehensive search strategies (23.2 %), explanations for excluded studies (20.0 %), adequate descriptions of included studies (38.3 %), or funding sources (19.1 %). Notably, SRs in Q4 journals (aMD: −19.7, 95 % CI: −33.8 to −5.5) and those on surgical interventions (aMD: −22.6, 95 % CI: −34.7 to −10.4) had lower AMSTAR 2 scores.
Conclusions
Although Peruvian-led SRs are increasingly being published, critical deficiencies are common, especially in reporting protocols, search strategies, study descriptions, and funding sources. Addressing these gaps is pivotal for enhancing the credibility and utility of these SRs in informing decision-making.

AB  - Context:
The aim of statistical causal inference (SCI) methods is to estimate causal effects from observational data (i.e., when randomized controlled trials are not possible). In this context, Pearl’s framework based on causal graphical models is an approach that has recently gained popularity and allows for explicit reasoning about issues related to spurious correlations.
Objective:
Our primary goal is to understand to which extend and how Pearl’s graphical framework is applied in software engineering (SE).
Methods:
We performed a systematic mapping study and analysed a total of 25 papers published between 2010 and 2022.
Results:
Our results show that the application of Pearl’s SCI framework in SE is relatively recent and that the corresponding research community is fragmented. Most of the selected papers focus on software quality analysis. There is no clear and widespread community of practice (yet) on how to implement and evaluate SCI in SE.
Conclusions:
To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a mapping study is done. We believe that SE practitioners might benefit from such a work, as it both provides an overview of the work and people involved in the application of causal inference methods, but also outlines the potential and limitations of such approaches.

Objective
In this paper, we aim to provide an extensive review of current research on ISSD and to establish a research agenda on this domain.
Method
The review is primarily performed using a systematic literature review protocol.
Results
We identified, critically evaluated and integrated the findings of 37 primary studies, describing 25 empirical research papers, 10 frameworks/methods, models and tools to support the implementation of inner source, as well as a set of benefits and challenges associated with ISSD.
Conclusion
This study presents four main contributions. First, the study provides an in-depth review of ISSD to date, i.e. the evolution of research across inner source, contributions of existing research developments, and theories, models and frameworks used to study inner source. Second, our review applies the OSSD approach framework as the lens to analyse ISSD. Third, the review updates the key challenges associated with ISSD from a management perspective. The final contribution is the establishment of a research agenda to advance knowledge on ISSD.

AB  - Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a high risk of GATA1-associated myeloid leukemia (ML-DS) before age 4. Somatic N-terminal GATA1 mutations (GATA1s) are necessary, but not sufficient, for ML-DS, but their significance at birth for individual babies and whether mutations occur after birth is unclear. To address these questions, we performed a prospective study of DS newborns using next-generation sequencing-based GATA1 mutation analysis with detailed hematologic and clinical evaluation and follow-up for the window of ML-DS risk. Of 450 DS neonates, 113 (25%) had GATA1s mutations of which 20/113 (17.7%) were multiple and 59 (52%) were clinically silent. Variant allele frequency (VAF) varied from 0.3-89%. VAF positively correlated (p<0.0001) with % blasts, leukocytes, dyserythro- and dysmegakaryopoiesis scores and clinical disease and negatively with hemoglobin, although only 4/113 were anemic. GATA1s mutations were detected from 28 weeks(w) gestation; the highest frequency (45%) was at 34-35w while mutation frequency in early fetal samples (<20w) was <4% (2/57). GATA1s clones (VAF, % blasts) fell rapidly post-natally becoming undetectable by 6 months (6m) except in neonates who developed ML-DS. 7/110 surviving neonates (6.4%) developed ML-DS at a median age of 17.5m. GATA1s clone size at birth was the only predictor of subsequent ML-DS. No neonates lacking GATA1s mutations acquired mutations after birth or developed ML-DS. Taken together, the fetal environment is essential for GATA1s mutation selection and expansion of GATA1s clones. Rates of leukemic transformation of GATA1s clones detected at birth are low but clones that persist beyond 6 months transformed.

AB  - The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twin technology is reshaping maintenance strategies in the era of Industry 4.0. However, gaps persist between academic advancements and industrial adoption and expectation. This study systematically investigates the landscape of AI-enhanced digital twins for maintenance by integrating a systematic literature review (SLR) of related studies with in-depth interviews from industry practitioners. Our analysis reveals that while academia demonstrates robust applications of supervised, deep, and reinforcement learning to optimize digital twin models and prescribe data-driven actions, industrial implementation remains limited by challenges such as high scale dimension, data integration complexities, and insufficient workforce readiness. We identified and articulated three critical gap dimensions, scale, data, and model between academic research and industrial implementation and expectation. To bridge these gaps, we proposed a comprehensive five-layer framework for AI-enhanced digital twins, encompassing physical assets, data transmission, digital twins, AI analytics, and maintenance services. Actionable recommendations are provided, including the adoption of modular architectures, standardized data protocols, hybrid edge-cloud solutions, and targeted workforce upskilling. Our findings not only clarify the current state and challenges of AI-driven digital twins in maintenance but also offer a practical roadmap for accelerating their industrial implementation. This work advances the field by integrating insights from both academic research and industrial practice, offering concrete recommendations to support the practical realization of smart and sustainable maintenance practices.

AB  - Mosquitoes can carry and spread many diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. All these mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) represent a significant global burden of infectious diseases, including morbidity and mortality. This systematic review delves into the multifaceted factors contributing to the spread of MBD in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Following PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed peer-reviewed English-language observational and experimental studies published between May 1990 and January 2023, focusing on the interaction between population, environmental, disease, and mosquito factors in MBD. The review includes 32 studies (30 articles) that revealed a complex relationship between various risk factors and the presence of MBD. The review distinguishes between seroprevalence studies, which assess exposure to infection in asymptomatic populations, and overt disease studies, which focus on symptomatic cases and the host-specific factors that affect disease severity. It identifies key risk factors such as age, geography, gender, professional occupation, and socio-economic status, noting their varying impacts on disease transmission and progression across different MBDs. Environmental factors such as climate, mosquito breeding habitats, and urbanization are also reported as significant drivers of vector distribution and human-vector interactions. The review emphasizes the need for tailored, region-specific interventions to control MBD in the MENA region and highlights the importance of integrated vector control, improved sanitation, surveillance programmes, and public health education. The review also stresses the growing influence of climate change on disease patterns and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to MBD control. While focusing on the MENA region, the findings suggest the need for further research and region-specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

AB  - Context:
Psychological safety (PS) is an important factor influencing team well-being and performance, particularly in collaborative and dynamic domains such as software development. Despite its acknowledged significance, research on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the context of software engineering.
Objective:
This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software development process.
Methods:
A systematic literature review was conducted, encompassing studies retrieved from four digital libraries. The extracted data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses.
Results:
The findings indicate a growing academic interest in PS within software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson’s framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team, and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and leadership behaviors. The presence of PS was found to positively impact team dynamics, software quality, technical excellence, and job satisfaction. Furthermore, PS was observed to mediate relationships between constructs such as ethical leadership and innovative behavior.
Conclusion:
PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective strategies for its enhancement. Future research should address these gaps by investigating the practical applications of PS within diverse organizational settings in the software engineering domain.

AB  - In this work, we introduce an open-source Julia project, express, an extensible, lightweight, high-throughput, high-level workflow framework that aims to automate ab initio calculations for the materials science community. express is shipped with well-tested workflow templates, including structure optimization, equation of state (EOS) fitting, phonon spectrum (lattice dynamics) calculation, and thermodynamic property calculation in the framework of the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). It is designed to be highly modularized so that its components can be reused across various occasions, and customized workflows can be built on top of that. Users can also track the status of workflows in real-time, and rerun failed jobs thanks to the data lineage feature express provides. Two working examples, i.e., all workflows applied to lime and akimotoite, are also presented in the code and this paper.
Program summary
Program Title: express CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/bbzzrxsm4b.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/MineralsCloud/Express.jl Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License v3.0 Programming language: Julia Nature of problem: High-performance ab initio calculation is gaining more and more popularity when investigating the physical and chemical properties of materials in the scientific community. There are several ab initio programs in the market, but they are often not user-friendly to new users because of their intrinsic complexity. Even for familiar users, dealing with daily preparation and post-analysis could be trivial and fallible. Therefore, plenty of workflow frameworks have been developed to solve this problem. However, most of them cannot meet our expectations for several reasons. They are either too complex to read and modify, or too heavy for simple tasks. Plus, they put little focus on addressing the real pain points of everyday calculations, such as data preparation and output parsing. Solution method: We developed a workflow framework that can simplify this process, i.e., most of the mundane work can be replaced by writing a few lines of configurations. We also automated the three most-used work procedures into configurable workflows: equations of state fitting (structural optimization), phonon spectrum calculation, and thermodynamics calculation.

KW  - Anomaly detection
AB  - Background:
Understanding dependencies within microservices is essential for maintaining and evolving scalable and efficient software architectures. Dependencies influence how changes in one microservice might propagate to other microservices. With the decentralized nature of microservices, these dependencies might not be explicit to developers and lead to unique challenges in modern software development environments.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to synthesize existing literature on microservice dependencies, identify the types of dependencies, and examine the strategies employed to manage and analyze these relationships. This effort aims to elucidate how dependencies affect microservice systems and to provide a comprehensive overview of dependency management within microservices.
Method:
We conducted a multivocal literature review, starting with an initial dataset of 1,733 papers from academic literature (white literature). This corpus was narrowed down through a rigorous filtering process to 45 key publications that address the identification, management, and impacts of dependencies in microservices. Additionally, we incorporated 926 articles from grey literature sources such as Google, Stack Overflow, and Stack Exchange, expanding the scope beyond traditional academic research. After the filtration process, 45 articles were fully synthesized to integrate practical insights and professional experiences into our review.
Results:
The review identifies several types of dependencies in microservice systems and synthesizes this information into a unified dependency taxonomy. This review highlights a range of approaches to dependency management, revealing a significant gap in systematic catering approaches to generate taxonomies for dependencies and the need for integrated management tools. The findings underscore the fragmented nature of existing dependency management practices and the potential for more holistic approaches.
Conclusion:
This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, outlining effective strategies and pointing out areas needing improvement in dependency management. By offering a structured overview of the topic, the study serves as a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the robustness and maintainability of microservices.

AB  - Background
Narrative operative reports (NOR) are important for cancer management but often lack key information. This review investigated the efficacy of synoptic operative reports (SORs) for cancer operations compared to NORs.
Methods
A database search included published studies up to October 31, 2021. Overall report completeness and reporting frequencies of cancer elements were descriptively compared between NORs and SORs.
Results
Among 4353 studies, 32 were included. 47% of studies compared NORs to SORs. Overall completeness favored SORs (80 ± 19%) over NORs (47 ± 18%, p < 0.001). Essential cancer operative report elements including tumor location (NOR: 51 ± 28%, SOR: 89 ± 11%, p < 0.001), presence of metastases (NOR: 36 ± 33%, SOR: 96 ± 5%, p < 0.001), and final resection margins (NOR: 39 ± 30%, SOR: 87 ± 17%, p < 0.001) demonstrated higher mean reporting frequencies in SORs.
Conclusion
Overall completeness and reporting of cancer elements were superior in SORs. Although standardization of SORs requires further research, transition from NORs to SORs may improve the quality of postoperative cancer care.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized tasks that previously required significant human effort, which has attracted considerable interest from industry stakeholders. This growing interest has accelerated the integration of AI models into various industrial applications. However, the model integration introduces challenges to product quality, as conventional quality measuring methods may fail to assess GenAI systems. Consequently, evaluation techniques for GenAI systems need to be adapted and refined. Examining the current state and applicability of evaluation techniques for the GenAI system outputs is essential.
Objective
This study aims to explore the current metrics, methods, and processes for assessing the outputs of GenAI systems and the potential of risky outputs.
Method
We performed a snowballing literature review to identify metrics, evaluation methods, and evaluation processes from 43 selected papers.
Results
We identified 28 metrics and mapped these metrics to four quality characteristics defined by the ISO/IEC 25023 standard for software systems. Additionally, we discovered three types of evaluation methods to measure the quality of system outputs and a three-step process to assess faulty system outputs. Based on these insights, we suggested a five-step framework for measuring system quality while utilizing GenAI models.
Conclusion
Our findings present a mapping that visualizes candidate metrics to be selected for measuring quality characteristics of GenAI systems, accompanied by step-by-step processes to assist practitioners in conducting quality assessments.

AB  - A major challenge for the European electronic industry is to enhance productivity by ensuring quality of development, integration and maintenance while reducing the associated costs. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) principles and techniques have already shown promising capabilities, but they still need to scale up to support real-world scenarios implied by the full deployment and use of complex electronic components and systems. Moreover, maintaining efficient traceability, integration, and communication between two fundamental system life cycle phases (design time and runtime) is another challenge requiring the scalability of MDE. This paper presents an overview of the ECSEL 11http://www.ecsel-ju.eu/web/index.php. project entitled “MegaModelling at runtime – Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems” (MegaM@Rt2), whose aim is to address the above mentioned challenges facing MDE. Driven by both large and small industrial enterprises, with the support of research partners and technology providers, MegaM@Rt2 aims to deliver a framework of tools and methods for: 1) system engineering/design and continuous development, 2) related runtime analysis and 3) global models and traceability management. Diverse industrial use cases (covering strategic domains such as aeronautics, railway, construction and telecommunications) will integrate and demonstrate the validity of the MegaM@Rt2 solution. This paper provides an overview of the MegaM@Rt2 project with respect to its approach, mission, objectives as well as to its implementation details. It further introduces the consortium as well as describes the work packages and few already produced deliverables.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are extensively reported in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) but the nature of this association is, to date, unclear. This study uses a scientometric methodology to explore the role of two key biological factors, namely melatonin and cortisol, including its precursor adrenocorticotropic hormone on sleep. Six hundred and thirty-four papers were retrieved from Scopus. A co-citation analysis was carried out, from which ten thematic clusters were identified and discussed chronologically, these were: “Epilepsy” (average year of publication = 1998), “Biology of sleep” (average year of publication = 2001), “Paediatric sleep” (average year of publication = 2001), “Sleep in ASD” (average year of publication = 2003), “Co-occurring conditions” (average year of publication = 2007), “Psychopharmacology, ASD and sleep” (average year of publication = 2007), “HPA-axis dysregulation” (average year of publication = 2009), “Use of melatonin for sleep disturbances in ASD” (average year of publication = 2013), “Safety of melatonin medications for sleep in ASD” (average year of publication = 2015), “Disturbed sleep in children, a symptom in a bigger picture” (average year of publication = 2016). Detailed analysis of each cluster indicated that the association between ASD and sleep is complex and multifactorial. As such, two main areas for future research were identified: (a) the need for larger studies that allow stratification of the population to uncouple confounding factors (e.g. concomitant use of medications) and (b) the need for longer, longitudinal studies assessing melatonin and cortisol in ASD across development.

AB  - The rise in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) introduced by OEMs has increased the demand for modern vehicle sophistication. This sophistication involves a variety of software capabilities and functionalities embedded in over 100 ECUs in a vehicle. This has led to the need for over-the-air (OTA) updates. OTA updates can be delivered wirelessly, eliminating the need to bring vehicles to the garage for updates. This is more convenient for owners, reduces costs for OEMs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. There exist different OTA update considerations that are adopted by automotive OEMs, such as the Uptane framework, Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA-DM) standard, and the general ISO 24089 standard, including subvariance of Uptane and OMA-DM. However, the systematic implementation of security-by-design applying ISO 21434 in OTA systems is less employed, and there remains a gap in this practice of security-by-design that the automotive industry can adapt to ensure a systematic approach to secure OTA update technology. OTA update security hinges on identifying vulnerability pathways for potential malicious attacks. Therefore, identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities throughout the OTA update process is critical for robust security. This paper proposes an adaptable security-by-design approach to OTA update, built and extended from our work Iyieke et al. (2023). The adaptable security-by-design approach is then applied to a developed prototype OTA update system based on the Uptane framework as implemented by Toradex. Security-by-design is a well-established concept in enterprise systems, but is still developing in the cyber–physical system of automotive cybersecurity. Our proposed approach covers the security engineering lifecycle, the logical security layered concept, and the security architecture. A threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) is performed based on the international automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434. The highest threats identified from the TARA are formalized, and corresponding mitigation actions are defined according to UNECE WP29. Penetration testing is conducted to verify the approach’s capability to reinforce the security of the OTA update systems against some of the identified risks and threats. Our proposed approach provides a systematic and adaptable security-by-design approach to ensure secure OTA updates in modern vehicles; OEMs and other stakeholders can use it to develop secure OTA systems regardless of the OTA update technology used.

AB  - Background
Electronic cigarettes, introduced as a safer tobacco alternative, have unintentionally exposed millions of youths to nicotine and harmful chemicals. Adolescence, a key period for forming lifelong habits, has seen rising e-cigarette use, particularly in developing regions like Latin America, warranting thorough investigation.
Objective
To describe the prevalence and factors associated with e-cigarette use among adolescents in Latin America.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, covering studies published between 2003 and May 2024. Database searches included PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Scielo, and LILACS. A total of 582 studies were identified, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Study data were synthesized and assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Joanna Briggs Institute checklist.
Results
The prevalence of e-cigarette among adolescents in six Latin American countries ranged from 2.6 % to 64.2 %, with a pooled mean prevalence of 18.9 %, and lifetime use higher than current use. Key associated factors included male sex, concurrent use of tobacco and other substances, social influences, and exposure to online advertising. A widespread lack of knowledge regarding e-cigarette risks, coupled with limited regulatory oversight, may be contributing to higher usage rates.
Conclusion
This review underscores critical gaps in data on adolescent e-cigarette use in Latin America and highlights the need for expanded research and targeted public health interventions. Nearly one-fifth of adolescents reported using e-cigarettes. Comprehensive prevention programs addressing factors associated with adolescent e-cigarette use in Latin America, involving diverse stakeholders and integrating education, school-based policies, social media campaigns, and policy restrictions, are strongly recommended.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between machine learning and smart contract vulnerabilities on the Ethereum blockchain. Introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum stands as a prominent blockchain network, necessitating innovative approaches to secure smart contracts against vulnerabilities and potential attacks. This research follows PRISMA guidelines, posing three fundamental questions and conducting a meticulous literature review. The study categorises machine learning applications into seven distinct groups, analysing their taxonomy, feature types, and engineering methods. The findings indicate a dynamic landscape characterised by a noticeable trend towards increased complexity. This complexity is evident not only in the integration of machine learning frameworks that combine different architectures of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), but also in the incorporation of various types of data related to smart contracts (SCs). The discussion dissects the advantages, limitations, and future directions in securing smart contracts using machine learning. The paper concludes by emphasising the evolving role of machine learning in strengthening the Ethereum blockchain, fostering trust, and enhancing security in decentralised systems.

AB  - Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and automation are transforming catalyst discovery and design from traditional trial-and-error manual mode into intelligent, high-throughput digital methodologies. This transformation is driven by four key components, including high-throughput information extraction, automated robotic experimentation, real-time feedback for iterative optimization, and interpretable machine learning for generating new knowledge. These innovations have given rise to the development of self-driving labs and significantly accelerated materials research. Over the past two years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has added a new dimension to this field, providing unprecedented flexibility in information integration, decision-making, and interacting with human researchers. This review explores how LLMs are reshaping catalyst design, heralding a revolutionary change in the fields.

AB  - Background: Concurrent software testing is a costly and difficult task, especially due to the exponential increase in the test sequences caused by non-determinism. Such an issue has motivated researchers to develop testing techniques that select a subset of the input domain that has a high probability of revealing faults. Academics and industrial practitioners rarely use most concurrent software testing techniques because of the lack of data about their applicability. Empirical evidence can provide an important scientific basis for the strengths and weaknesses of each technique to help researchers and practitioners choose concurrent testing techniques appropriate for their environments. Aim: This paper gathers and synthesizes empirical research on concurrent software testing to characterize the field and the types of empirical studies performed. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze empirical research on concurrent software testing techniques. We provide a detailed analysis of the studies and their design choices. Results: The primary findings are: (1) there is a general lack of empirical validation of concurrent software testing techniques, (2) the type of evaluation method varies with the type of technique, (3) there are some key challenges to empirical study design in concurrent software testing, and (4) there is a dearth of controlled experiments in concurrent software testing. Conclusions: There is little empirical evidence available about some specific concurrent testing techniques like model-based testing and formal testing. Overall, researchers need to perform more empirical work, especially real-world case studies and controlled experiments, to validate properties of concurrent software testing techniques. In addition, researchers need to perform more analyses and synthesis of the existing evidence. This paper is a first step in that direction.

AB  - Pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (ALL/LL) and obesity are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The PREVAPIX-ALL trial was an open-label randomized controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of apixaban for VTE prevention in pediatric patients with ALL/LL. An a priori subgroup analysis of obese patients in PREVAPIX-ALL was planned due to increased VTE risk in this group. Obese patients, ages ≥ 2 to < 18 years, with a central venous catheter, and chemotherapy containing asparaginase were randomized to apixaban (prophylactic dose) versus standard of care (SOC-no anticoagulation) during induction chemotherapy (29 days). The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of non-fatal symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE and VTE-related-death. The primary and secondary safety outcomes were major bleeding and a composite of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, respectively. Eighty-two PREVAPIX-ALL participants presented with obesity, of which 42 were randomized to apixaban. For the primary efficacy endpoint, a significant decrease in VTE events was present in the apixaban arm (1/42 [2.4%]) as compared to the SOC arm (10/40 [25%]), (Relative Risk (RR) 0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01-0.97; P=0.007). There was a statistically significant treatment obesity interaction, P=0.03. No statistically significant difference was observed for the primary efficacy endpoint among the non-obese group (RR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.37; P=0.50). No significant difference was observed in major or CRNM bleeding among subgroups. Apixaban prophylaxis in obese ALL/LL patients resulted in a statistically significant VTE risk reduction with no increase in bleeding events. (NCT02369653).

AB  - Background
Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide affecting an estimated 300 million people. Pharmacists can play key roles to support optimal health outcomes for patients with asthma. Goffman's Dramaturgical Theory was used in this review to critically examine the literature describing the role of pharmacists in asthma services.
Objectives
The aim of this review is to identify factors that influence the role of pharmacists in asthma care services.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted of seven electronic databases including: CINAHL, Midline (Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, Embase and PsycInfo.). The search was not restricted by language or date of publication. Studies were screened according to inclusion criteria which included much relate to pharmacists, asthma services and include qualitative findings. Data was extracted and thematically synthesised to create demographic, descriptive and analytical findings.
Results
Eighteen studies were included. The majority of studies were conducted in high income countries, with most of the studies conducted in Australia (n = 10). Semi-structured interview was used as a method for data collection in most studies (n = 11). Evidence indicated pharmacists engaged in asthma services positively and wanted to expand their roles in patient care. However, literature reported patients' attitudes and health-system factors such as remuneration, as well as inter-professional collaboration and expected low levels of knowledge and skills of pharmacists were barriers to implementation of pharmacy-led asthma care. Analytical findings suggest that pharmacists' involvement in asthma care services were influenced by patients' and healthcare professionals' expectations which were juxtaposed with pharmacists' own self-perceived identity.
Conclusions
This review demonstrates pharmacists self-identified as being capable and equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills, however the expectations of patients and other healthcare professionals prohibited their involvement in delivering asthma care services.

AB  - Video understanding technology has become increasingly important in various disciplines, yet current approaches have primarily focused on lower comprehension level of video content, posing challenges for providing comprehensive and professional insights at a higher comprehension level. Video analysis plays a crucial role in athlete training and strategy development in racket sports. This study aims to demonstrate an innovative and higher-level video comprehension framework (ChatMatch), which integrates computer vision technologies with the cutting-edge large language models (LLM) to enable intelligent analysis and inference of racket sports videos. To examine the feasibility of this framework, we deployed a prototype of ChatMatch in the badminton in this study. A vision-based encoder was first proposed to extract the meta-features included the locations, actions, gestures, and action results of players in each frame of racket match videos, followed by a rule-based decoding method to transform the extracted information in both structured knowledge and unstructured knowledge. A set of LLM-based agents included namely task identifier, coach agent, statistician agent, and video manager, was developed through a prompt engineering and driven by an automated mechanism. The automatic collaborative interaction among the agents enabled the provision of a comprehensive response to professional inquiries from users. The validation findings showed that our vision models had excellent performances in meta-feature extraction, achieving a location identification accuracy of 0.991, an action recognition accuracy of 0.902, and a gesture recognition accuracy of 0.950. Additionally, a total of 100 questions were gathered from four proficient badminton players and one coach to evaluate the performance of the LLM-based agents, and the outcomes obtained from ChatMatch exhibited commendable results across general inquiries, statistical queries, and video retrieval tasks. These findings highlight the potential of using this approach that can offer valuable insights for athletes and coaches while significantly improve the efficiency of sports video analysis.

AB  - Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize health care by enhancing both clinical outcomes and operational efficiency. However, its clinical adoption has been slower than anticipated, largely due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Existing frameworks remain insufficient and tend to emphasize technical metrics such as accuracy and validation, while overlooking critical real-world factors such as clinical impact, integration, and economic sustainability. This narrow focus prevents AI tools from being effectively implemented, limiting their broader impact and long-term viability in clinical practice.
Objective
This study aimed to create a framework for assessing AI in health care, extending beyond technical metrics to incorporate social and organizational dimensions. The framework was developed by systematically reviewing, analyzing, and synthesizing the evaluation criteria necessary for successful implementation, focusing on the long-term real-world impact of AI in clinical practice.
Methods
A search was performed in July 2024 across the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify relevant studies published in English between January 2019 and mid-July 2024, yielding 3528 results, among which 44 studies met the inclusion criteria. The systematic review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Data were analyzed using NVivo through thematic analysis and narrative synthesis to identify key emergent themes in the studies.
Results
By synthesizing the included studies, we developed a framework that goes beyond the traditional focus on technical metrics or study-level methodologies. It integrates clinical context and real-world implementation factors, offering a more comprehensive approach to evaluating AI tools. With our focus on assessing the long-term real-world impact of AI technologies in health care, we named the framework AI for IMPACTS. The criteria are organized into seven key clusters, each corresponding to a letter in the acronym: (1) I—integration, interoperability, and workflow; (2) M—monitoring, governance, and accountability; (3) P—performance and quality metrics; (4) A—acceptability, trust, and training; (5) C—cost and economic evaluation; (6) T—technological safety and transparency; and (7) S—scalability and impact. These are further broken down into 28 specific subcriteria.
Conclusions
The AI for IMPACTS framework offers a holistic approach to evaluate the long-term real-world impact of AI tools in the heterogeneous and challenging health care context and lays the groundwork for further validation through expert consensus and testing of the framework in real-world health care settings. It is important to emphasize that multidisciplinary expertise is essential for assessment, yet many assessors lack the necessary training. In addition, traditional evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with AI’s rapid development. To ensure successful AI integration, flexible, fast-tracked assessment processes and proper assessor training are needed to maintain rigorous standards while adapting to AI’s dynamic evolution.

AB  - Environmental sensing is crucial for the effective operation of mobile robots, particularly on construction sites where conditions can change rapidly. While some studies have implemented different sensing technologies independently for autonomous mobile robot navigation, comprehensive studies on applicable sensors and technologies for dynamic construction environments, particularly for enhancing productivity and safety, are lacking. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of environmental sensing technologies for mobile construction robots, assessing their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability in the dynamic construction environment. Utilizing a combination of scientometric analysis and a critical review, three themes—vision-based sensing, localization and mapping, and autonomous navigation and path planning, which form the main sensing systems for the operation of autonomous mobile robots—were identified and analyzed. The review also identified and evaluated the different sensor technologies that facilitate environmental sensing. This paper also highlights significant research gaps and provides recommendations for future research studies.

AB  - Cannabis use represents the most commonly illicit drug intake worldwide. m-Health interventions have the potential to play a key role in the fight against cannabis intake issues. A steadily increasing number of m-Health apps are currently available on commercial app stores to support psychoactive substance users. This study aims at exploring technical and functional characteristics of available m-Health-apps intended for non-medical Cannabis Use and Dependence (CUD). We carried out a scoping review following guidance from Arksey & O’Malley. We searched in Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases end of March 2021. Only five papers fitted our inclusion criteria out of 113 studies. Four out of five included studies reported a decrease of cannabis use and adequate feasibility and acceptability of m-Health apps. Most of these studies used self-reported questionnaires. More studies are need to rigourously assess the usability and effective of m-Health apps for CUD.

AB  - Background and Aims
Incidence of post-procedural cholecystitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using a covered self-expandable metal stent (CSEMS) for distal malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) has been gradually reported. Without sufficient data, the recommendation for stent placement favors CSEMS over uncovered self-expandable metal stent (USEMS), with the tip should be placed below the cystic duct orifice. This study assessed the safety of CSEMS versus USEMS in the management of distal MBO.
Methods
All studies published up to December 2024 comparing adverse events after CSEMS and USEMS placement for biliary drainage were identified using PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, and The Cochrane Library. Outcomes of interest were post-procedural cholecystitis, pancreatitis, stent migration, and tumor ingrowth. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effect model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on study design and the presence of a gallbladder in situ.
Results
21 studies (5,753 patients) met inclusion criteria. The CSEMS group showed higher post-ERCP acute cholecystitis rates (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.12 – 2.62), lower tumor ingrowth rates (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.25) and higher rates of stent migration (RR 7.53, 95% CI 4.60 - 12.32). The difference was also demonstrated in subgroup analysis based on the presence of a gallbladder in situ.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated higher rates of post-procedural cholecystitis following ERCP with CSEMS placement compared to USEMS. These findings highlight the importance of careful stent selection, particularly in patients with gallbladder in-situ, to optimize patient care, reduce adverse events and prevent delays in oncologic management.

AB  - Introduction: In COPD patients, mucus plugs are associated with lower lung function, worse quality of life, higher all-cause mortality, and a higher rate of exacerbations. The aim of the study was to determine whether subjects with COPD with a higher cumulative smoking history, such as current smokers, have a higher mucus plug score compared to former and never smokers with COPD. Material and Methods: We have carried out a systematic review of the literature (SRL) and a meta-analysis (MA). Results: Nine articles were finally included in the SRL, and 6 of them were part of the MA. We found that subjects who had never smoked had a lower rate of mucus plugs when compared to active and ex-smokers (OR 0.08 [CI 95% 0.06, 0.12]). When comparing subjects with and without mucus plugs between current smokers vs. ex-smokers, we found that ex-smokers had a higher rate of mucus plugs than current smokers (OR 1.12 [CI 95% 1.02,1.24]). When comparing subjects without mucus plugs or with a low mucus plug score (0-2) with a high mucus plug score (>3) between current smokers vs. ex-smokers, we found that ex-smokers had a higher mucus plug score than current smokers (OR 1.19 [CI 95% 1.08, 1.32]) Conclusions: We found that subjects who have never smoked have a lower rate of mucus plugs than those who have smoked and that ex-smokers with COPD have a higher rate of mucus plugs than current smokers with COPD. Quitting smoking is the most significant modifiable risk factor for COPD.
Resumen
Introducción: En pacientes con EPOC, los tapones mucosos se asocian con una función pulmonar más baja, peor calidad de vida, mayor mortalidad por cualquier causa y una mayor tasa de exacerbaciones. El objetivo del estudio fue determinar si los sujetos con EPOC con un mayor historial de tabaquismo acumulado, como los fumadores actuales, presentan una mayor puntuación de tapón mucoso en comparación con los exfumadores y los nunca fumadores con EPOC. Material y Métodos: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de la literatura (SRL) y un metaanálisis (MA). Resultados: Nueve artículos se incluyeron finalmente en la SRL, y 6 de ellos formaron parte del MA. Se observó que los sujetos que nunca habían fumado presentaron una menor tasa de tapones mucosos en comparación con los fumadores activos y exfumadores (OR: 0,08 [IC 95%: 0,06; 0,12]). Al comparar sujetos con y sin tapones mucosos entre fumadores actuales y exfumadores, se observó que los exfumadores presentaron una mayor tasa de tapones mucosos que los fumadores actuales (OR: 1,12 [IC del 95%: 1,02; 1,24]). Al comparar sujetos sin tapones mucosos o con una puntuación baja de tapón mucoso (0-2) con una puntuación alta de tapón mucoso (>3) entre fumadores actuales y exfumadores, se observó que los exfumadores presentaron una puntuación de tapón mucoso mayor que los fumadores actuales (OR: 1,19 [IC del 95%: 1,08; 1,32]). Conclusiones: Se observó que los sujetos que nunca han fumado presentan una menor tasa de tapones mucosos que los que han fumado, y que los exfumadores con EPOC presentan una mayor tasa de tapones mucosos que los fumadores actuales con EPOC. Dejar de fumar es el factor de riesgo modificable más significativo para la EPOC.

AB  - Introduction
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pulp survival rate of cracked teeth with normal pulp or reversible pulpitis managed using external splinting.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to January 31, 2025. Clinical studies evaluating pulp survival in permanent mature cracked teeth diagnosed with normal pulp or reversible pulpitis, with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months, were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, while the quality of evidence (QoE) was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Publication bias was analyzed through funnel plots and Begg's test. A random-effects model was utilized to estimate the pooled pulp survival rates.
Results
A total of 10 studies comprising 711 cracked teeth with varying management protocols met the inclusion criteria. The weighted pooled pulp survival rate at 12 months was 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79%–91%), with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 82.6%). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability of these findings. Funnel plot analysis revealed no publication bias. Subgroup analysis indicated that teeth managed without interim orthodontic banding exhibited a higher pulp survival rate (89%, 95% CI: 83%–95%) than with orthodontic banding (79%, 95% CI: 67%–90%). Survival was also greater with the direct approach [89% (95% CI, 82%–97%)] than the stepwise approach [81% (95% CI, 72%–90%)]. The overall risk of bias was moderate, and the QoE was categorized as very low.
Conclusions
For cracked teeth with reversible pulpitis, external splinting has demonstrated favorable pulpal survival rate at 1 year, albeit with considerable variation in treatment protocols. However, given the substantial heterogeneity and overall low QoE, there remains a need for rigorous, high-quality comparative studies to establish a standardized treatment approach.

AB  - The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.

AB  - Recent software development methodologies emphasize iterative and incremental evolution to align with stakeholders’ needs. This perpetual and rapid software evolution demands ongoing research into verification practices and technologies that ensure swift responsiveness and effective management of software delta increments. Strategies such as code review have been widely adopted for development and verification, ensuring readability and consistency in the delta increments of software projects. However, the integration of techniques to detect and visually report delta changes within the Graphical User Interface (GUI) software applications remains an underutilized process. In this paper, we set out to achieve two objectives. First, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies concerning GUI change detection in desktop, web, and mobile applications to recognize common practices. Second, we introduce a novel change detection tool capable of highlighting delta GUI changes for this diverse range of applications. To accomplish our first objective, we performed a systematic mapping of the literature using the Scopus database. To address the second objective, we designed and developed a GUI change detection tool. This tool simultaneously transits and compares state models inferred by a scriptless testing tool, enabling the detection and highlighting of GUI changes to detect the widgets or functionalities that have been added, removed, or modified. Our study reveals the existence of a multitude of techniques for change detection in specific GUI systems with different objectives. However, there is no widely adopted technique suitable for the diverse range of existing desktop, web, and mobile applications. Our tool and findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using inferred state models to highlight between 8 and 20 GUI changes in software delta increments containing a large number of changes over months and between 4 and 6 GUI changes in delta increments of small iterations performed over multiple weeks. Moreover, some of these changes were recognized by the software developers as GUI failures that required a fix. Finally, we expose the motivation for using this technique to help developers and testers analyze GUI changes to validate delta increments and detect potential GUI failures, thereby fostering knowledge dissemination and paving the way to standard practices.

AB  - TP53-Y220C is a recurrent hotspot mutation in cancers and leukemias. It is observed predominantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndromes among hematological malignancies and is associated with poor outcome. The mutation creates a structural pocket in the p53 protein. PC14586 (rezatapopt) is a small molecule designed to bind to this pocket and thus restore a p53-wild type (p53-WT) conformation. We demonstrate that PC14586 converts p53-Y220C into a p53-WT conformation and activates p53 transcriptional targets, but surprisingly induces limited/no apoptosis in TP53-Y220C AML. Mechanistically, MDM2 induced by PC14586-activated conformational p53-WT and the nuclear exporter XPO1 reduce the transcriptional activities of p53, which are fully restored by inhibition of MDM2 and/or XPO1. Importantly, p53-WT protein can bind to BCL-2, competing with BAX in the BH3 binding pocket of BCL-2 and also binds to BCL-xL and MCL-1. However, such binding by PC14586-activated conformational p53-WT is not detected. Pharmacological inhibition of the BCL-2/BAX interaction with venetoclax fully compensates for this deficiency, induces massive cell death in AML cells and stem/progenitor cells in vitro and prolongs survival of TP53-Y220C AML xenografts in vivo. Collectively, we identified transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms that limit the apoptogenic activities of reactivated conformational p53-WT and suggest approaches to optimize apoptosis induction in TP53-mutant leukemia. A clinical trial of PC14586 in TP53-Y220C AML/myelodysplastic syndromes has recently been initiated (NCT06616636).

AB  - Offshore wind energy leverages the high intensity and consistency of oceanic winds, playing a key role in the transition to renewable energy. As energy demands grow, larger turbines are required to optimize power generation and reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE), which represents the average cost of electricity over a project’s lifetime. However, upscaling turbines introduces engineering challenges, particularly in the design of supporting structures, especially towers. These towers must support increased loads while maintaining structural integrity, cost-efficiency, and transportability, making them essential to offshore wind projects’ success. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design optimization of Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) structures, with a focus on towers. It provides an in-depth background on key areas such as design types, load types, analysis methods, design processes, monitoring systems, Digital Twin (DT) technology, software, standards, reference turbines, economic factors, and optimization techniques. Additionally, it includes a state-of-the-art review of optimization studies related to tower design optimization, presenting a detailed examination of turbines, software, loads, optimization methods, design variables and constraints, analysis, and findings, motivating future research to refine design approaches for effective turbine upscaling and improved efficiency. Lastly, the paper explores future directions where AI can revolutionize tower design optimization, enabling the development of efficient, scalable, and sustainable structures. By addressing the upscaling challenges and supporting the growth of renewable energy, this work contributes to shaping the future of offshore wind turbine towers and other supporting structures.

AB  - Background
Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of Vascular Surgery Educational Courses (VSEC) provided by academic institutions, regional and national vascular surgical societies, as well as industry partners. Each course has its own curriculum and how these curricula align with the modern needs of vascular surgery trainees are unclear. As such, there is a lack of unified content, syllabus, and trainee evaluations/feedback of these courses. The Education Committee for the Association for Program directors in Vascular Surgery (APDVS) was tasked to survey vascular surgery Program directors (PDs) and Associate Program directors (APDs) across the country to investigate the educational value, utility, and feedback provided from these VSEC.
Methods
A comprehensive list of vascular surgery educational courses across the country was generated. A 21-question survey was constructed and forwarded to all members of APDVS. The survey was directed at obtaining data from the vascular surgery program director/associate program directors about their understanding of the VSEC and what they valued as critical for their trainees. In addition, we sought to gauge the feedback provided by these courses to the vascular surgery trainees, and their PD/APDs.
Results
The survey was sent to 170 active members of APDVS with an overall response rate of 41%. The majority of the respondents 57 (81%) were PDs. Of all the PD/APDs, 5 (7%) reported that they knew of less than 5 such programs, 26 (37%) reported knowledge of 6–10 courses, 20 (29%) reported 11–20 courses, and 19 (27%) reported knowing more than 20 such programs. 49 (70%) of those surveyed reported that their trainees benefit from these courses. Statisticallysignificant factors impacting the decision to make adjustments to the individual training program included PGY-5 residents attending the educational courses, feedback from VSEC, and positive feedback from trainees attending the courses (all P < 0.05). When asked about their wants of VSEC, 35% desired mock oral exams, and 31% looked for cadaver dissections. Of the 24 PD/APD's who made adjustments to their program based on the feedback from the educational programs, those who held the title for 5–10 years were the most willing to make any changes 13 (54%), and those with more than ten years of experience 2 (8%), were the least willing to make any changes (P < 0.05). The majority of the PD/APDs 32 (46%) felt that the regional societal meetings are the best place to hold educational courses. 38 (55%) of PD/APD's received no feedback from the VSEC course directors. 41 (59%) of the programs provide some financial support for their trainees to attend these courses and 65 (92%) of the PD/APDs suggest that industry partners should provide the financial support for attending VSEC.
Conclusions
This unique survey explores the attitude of vascular surgery educators about outside vascular surgery educational courses offered by various groups and industry. It is important to create standardized curricula for vascular surgery educational courses with collaborative oversight by educational/simulation key opinion leaders, PD/APD's, course directors and industry partners. Exploring benchmarks for standardization of the curricula offered by these outside educational opportunities would streamline the needs of our vascular surgery trainees and minimize time away from home institutions. Feedback identifying vascular trainees’ strengths and areas for improvement to PD/APDs would be of great educational value and is currently a missed opportunity.

AB  - Managers play a critical role in considering their organization’s needs, goals, and objectives when making decisions. However, most written material is produced before or after the issue it addresses, requiring managers to have prior knowledge to apply it correctly. We contend that fundamental business process analysis and straightforward reengineering can be used to the procedures outlined in the documentation to improve decision-making processes. This approach is illustrated through a study focusing on trauma planning. Process models were created from the trauma planning documentation to assess the effectiveness of the time process. Procedures were then redesigned, increasing efficiency while maintaining the time for partial activities. By using this approach, managers can ensure that their organization’s objectives are met while improving efficiency and productivity. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the effectiveness of existing procedures and reengineering them where necessary.

AB  - Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), holds significant promise for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR). However, standardized reporting guidance for LLM-assisted research is lacking. This article introduces the ELEVATE-GenAI framework and checklist—reporting guidelines specifically designed for HEOR studies involving LLMs.
Methods
The framework was developed through a targeted literature review of existing reporting guidelines, AI evaluation frameworks, and expert input from the ISPOR Working Group on Generative AI. It comprises ten domains—including model characteristics, accuracy, reproducibility, and fairness and bias. The accompanying checklist translates the framework into actionable reporting items. To illustrate its use, the framework was applied to two published HEOR studies: one focused on a systematic literature review tasks and the other on economic modeling.
Results
The ELEVATE-GenAI framework offers a comprehensive structure for reporting LLM-assisted HEOR research, while the checklist facilitates practical implementation. Its application to the two case studies demonstrates its relevance and usability across different HEOR contexts.
Limitations
Although the framework provides robust reporting guidance, further empirical testing is needed to assess its validity, completeness, usability as well as its generalizability across diverse HEOR use cases.
Conclusion
The ELEVATE-GenAI framework and checklist address a critical gap by offering structured guidance for transparent, accurate, and reproducible reporting of LLM-assisted HEOR research. Future work will focus on extensive testing and validation to support broader adoption and refinement.

AB  - Background
The diffused and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 transmission lead to high levels of hospitalization. During this period, the focus of sanitary structures was to contain COVID-19 mortality and this may have reduced the application of health associated infection (HAI) and multidrug resistant microorganism (MDRO) prevention programs.
Methods
A search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases to identify clinical observational studies that reported the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence or incidence on HAIs and/or MDROs from December 2019 to August 2024 in Italy. Studies were included if they reported a comparison with pre-pandemic period and had a full-text available. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias and quality with NHI Quality Assessment Tool by two researchers independently. Data were represented in tables and a narrative synthesis was made in the text.
Results
Selected studies included 4 studies reporting data on HAI (1497 total patients) and 11 studies reporting data on MDRO (80388 total patients). The majority of the studies reported an increase in HAI prevalence (9–11.1 % range) and MDRO, in particular, gram negative MDRO had an increase range of 0.8 %-45.6 % and gram positive MDRO an increase range of 0.5 %-81.8 % from pre- to post-COVID-19 period in the different studies considered
Conclusion
These findings underscore the critical need for active surveillance in hospital wards, the implementation of antibiotic stewardship and prescribing programs to mitigate the impact of such crises on healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, permanent training of healthcare personnel is necessary.

AB  - Objective
To investigate whether published studies that identified a causal relationship between psychological stress and seizure worsening in patients with epilepsy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic considered the temporality of Hill’s criteria.
Method
A systematic review approach was used to comprehensively search MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for relevant studies. Studies that reported an association between psychological stress and seizure worsening in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic were included accordingly. The quality of assessments in each study was evaluated and an assessment for considering temporality in the causal relationship between the two events in each study was carried out.
Results
Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. Most (14/17) were cross-sectional studies and only four out of these 17 studies (23.5%) considered temporality in the causality. Further, these four studies did not consider temporality in the study design, they only described it as a limitation.
Conclusion
We found that many articles reported a causal relationship between psychological stress and seizure worsening without considering temporality. As both researchers and readers, we need to consider temporality when interpreting the causal relationship between increased psychological stress and seizure worsening in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DCA++ implements the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA+ extension with a continuous self-energy. The algorithms capture nonlocal correlations in strongly correlated electron systems, thereby giving insight into high-Tc superconductivity. The code’s scalability allows efficient usage of systems at all scales, from workstations to leadership computers. With regard to the increasing heterogeneity of modern computing machines, DCA++ provides portable performance on conventional and emerging new architectures, such as hybrid CPU–GPU, sustaining multiple petaflops on ORNL’s Titan and CSCS’ Piz Daint supercomputers. Moreover, we show how sustainable and scalable development of the code base has been achieved by adopting standard techniques of the software industry. These include employing a distributed version control system, applying test-driven development and following continuous integration.

AB  - People with sickle cell disease (SCD) may be transfused with red cell units that are near the end of their storage life, exposing them to components of the red cell storage lesion. The current study evaluated the clinical impact of storage age and red cell distress markers on chronically transfused adults with SCD. This randomized prospective clinical trial recruited 26 chronically transfused adults (>16-years-old) with SCD; 13 subjects were randomized to each study arm, i.e. targeted to receive only ≥ 30 day or ≤ 10 day stored red cell units for 3 consecutive outpatient transfusion events. The red cell units were evaluated via quantification of surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Differences in key clinical variables were also evaluated. We show that subjects receiving units with higher surface-exposed PS and PE, regardless of storage age, had a reduced hemoglobin increment at 2 weeks (PS-PE high: 0.59g/dL; PS-PE-low: 1.04g/dL, p=0.04), increased pain crises (IRR= 7.44; 95%CI: 1.53-36.25), and had higher odds of reported illness (OR=1.94; 95%CI: 1.06-3.54). Further, post-transfusion serum iron predicted subsequent subjective symptoms of illness (ROC-AUC=0.76) and correlated with smaller increases in HbA% post-transfusion (r=-0.36, p=0.04). These data suggest that, in addition to chronological storage age, the physiological state of transfused red cells as defined by PS and PE and subject serum iron may deleteriously affect patient outcomes. Future studies focusing on identifying and then avoiding lower quality red cell units in high-risk patients with SCD could enhance patient safety (NCT03704922).

AB  - Pathogen removal in wastewater offers a chance to recover water and nutrients for crop production, reducing environmental contamination and public health risks. However, the risk of pathogens regrowing in treated effluents can endanger public health if reused in agriculture, attracting stringent reuse standards. While advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) promise to reduce pathogens, eliminating regrowth potential in AOP-treated effluents requires further scrutiny. This review aimed to summarize the available evidence on understanding pathogen reduction and regrowth potential in AOP-treated effluents, following best practices for scoping reviews like the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). It covers recent pathogen studies under AOPs, current AOP investigations, the impact of AOP dosage and retention time on pathogen control, and challenges in reusing AOP-treated effluents for crop production. Additionally, it identifies areas needing improvement or complementary treatments for pathogen-free effluents with no regrowth potential. The review concludes by summarizing key findings and suggesting research areas for further exploration.
