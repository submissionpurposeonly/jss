AB  - Background
Population studies show that musculoskeletal conditions are a leading contributor to the total burden of healthy life lost, second only to cancer and with a similar burden to cardiovascular disease. Prioritizing the delivery of effective treatments is necessary, and with the ubiquity of consumer smart devices, the use of digital health interventions is increasing. Messaging is popular and easy to use and has been studied for a range of health-related uses, including health promotion, encouragement of behavior change, and monitoring of disease progression. It may have a useful role to play in the management and self-management of musculoskeletal conditions.
Objective
Previous reviews on the use of messaging for people with musculoskeletal conditions have focused on synthesizing evidence of effectiveness from randomized controlled trials. In this review, our objective was to map the musculoskeletal messaging literature more broadly to identify information that may inform the design of future messaging interventions and summarize the current evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, and economics.
Methods
Following a prepublished protocol developed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis, we conducted a comprehensive scoping review of the literature (2010-2022; sources: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO) related to SMS text messaging and app-based messaging for people with musculoskeletal conditions. We described our findings using tables, plots, and a narrative summary.
Results
We identified a total of 8328 papers for screening, of which 50 (0.6%) were included in this review (3/50, 6% previous reviews and 47/50, 94% papers describing 40 primary studies). Rheumatic diseases accounted for the largest proportion of the included primary studies (19/40, 48%), followed by studies on multiple musculoskeletal conditions or pain sites (10/40, 25%), back pain (9/40, 23%), neck pain (1/40, 3%), and “other” (1/40, 3%). Most studies (33/40, 83%) described interventions intended to promote positive behavior change, typically by encouraging increased physical activity and exercise. The studies evaluated a range of outcomes, including pain, function, quality of life, and medication adherence. Overall, the results either favored messaging interventions or had equivocal outcomes. While the theoretical underpinnings of the interventions were generally well described, only 4% (2/47) of the papers provided comprehensive descriptions of the messaging intervention design and development process. We found no relevant economic evaluations.
Conclusions
Messaging has been used for the care and self-management of a range of musculoskeletal conditions with generally favorable outcomes reported. However, with few exceptions, design considerations are poorly described in the literature. Further work is needed to understand and disseminate information about messaging content and message delivery characteristics, such as timing and frequency specifically for people with musculoskeletal conditions. Similarly, further work is needed to understand the economic effects of messaging and practical considerations related to implementation and sustainability.

Therefore, this humble research is a glance through the problems - the bias and discrimination of AI based Administrative Decision Making and Support systems. At first, I determined the bias and discrimination, their blur boundary between two definitions from the legal perspective, then went into the details of the causes of bias in each stage of AI system development, mainly as the results of bias data sources and human decisions in the past, society and political contexts, and the developers’ ethics. In the same chapter, I presented the non-discrimination legal framework, including their application and convergence with the administration laws in regard to the automated decision making and support systems, as well as the involvement of ethics and regulations on personal data protection. In the next chapter, I tried to outline new proposals for potential solutions from both legal and technical perspectives. In respect to the former, my focus was fairness definitions and other current options for the developers, for example, the toolkits, benchmark datasets, debiased data, etc. For the latter, I reported the strategies and new proposals governing the datasets and AI systems development, implementation in the near future.

AB  - Apparel mills strive to perform better but need the right strategy that would allow them to remain cost-efficient and responsive at the same time to scale according to retail and market demands. Besides the right strategy, the apparel mills require the right resources and capabilities to increase their operational and export performance. A theoretical resource and leagile strategy model is developed to empirically assess the association between resources, capabilities, generic strategy, leagile strategy, and performance under present uncertainties in the apparel supply chain to understand an apparel mill’s complexities. The research data is collected through a survey in the apparel and textile industry in the export sector comprising 348 responses. SmartPLS 4.0 has been used to test relations, mediation of leagile strategy, and moderation of uncertainty. The study outcomes validate that supply chain manager, integration, customer focus, cost leadership, and leagile strategy positively impact apparel mill performance. In moderation testing, demand uncertainty moderates the relation between leagile strategy and apparel mill performance, and in mediation analysis, leagile mediates between resources and performance. The resource and leagile strategy (RLS) model is an essential measure that could assist practitioners and researchers in understanding leagile strategy for increasing firm performance.

AB  - An ever-increasing demand for products and their consumption has put pressure on industrial output and their supply chains, and that demand has resulted in negative impacts on the environment and society. Increasing rates of pollution and environmental calamities caused by industrial production have urged several researchers and industry experts to work on Sustainable Production and Consumption issues within the context of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). This paper comprehensively covers the exponential growth of the topic through an evolutionary lens. This article attempts to understand the evolution of sustainability issues by analysing trends across industries, economies, and through the use of various methodologies. A comprehensive thematic analysis was performed on 1068 filtered articles from 2000 to 2015, highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge. The study proposes a conceptual framework to classify various factors along the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability issues in the context of supply chains. An in-depth study is conducted on 190 articles covering all pillars of sustainability (as per the proposed conceptual framework) on SSCM. We observe that studies focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability are comparatively scarce. More focus on industry-specific studies is required because problems addressing industries that are serious polluters, especially those in emerging economies, remains largely unaddressed. It is observed that the studies addressing social issues are scarce, and more focus is required on the measurement of social impacts along the supply chain. Finally, we propose future avenues to extend research on the SSCM domain while keeping in mind the need to address industry specific and economy specific problems from the triple bottom line perspective.

AB  - Modern automotive software systems consist of hundreds of heterogeneous software applications, belonging to separated function domains and often developed within distributed automotive ecosystems consisting of original equipment manufactures, tier-1 and tier-2 companies. Hence, the development of modern automotive software systems is a formidable challenge. A well-known instrument for coping with the tremendous heterogeneity and complexity of modern automotive software systems is the use of architectural languages as a way of enabling different and specific views over these systems. However, the use of different architectural languages might come with the cost of reduced interoperability and automation as different languages might have weak to no integration. In this article, we tackle the challenge of integrating two architectural languages heavily used in the automotive domain for the design and timing analysis of automotive software systems: AMALTHEA and Rubus Component Model. The main contributions of this paper are (i) a mapping scheme for the translation of an AMALTHEA architecture into a Rubus Component Model architecture where high-precision timing analysis can be run, and the back annotation of the analysis results on the starting AMALTHEA architecture; (ii) the implementation of the proposed scheme, which uses the concept of model transformations for enabling a full-fledged automated integration; (iii) the application of such automation on three industrial automotive systems being the brake-by-wire, the full blown engine management system and the engine management system. We discuss and evaluate the proposed contributions using an online, experts survey and the above-mentioned use cases. Based on the evaluation results, we conclude that the proposed automation mechanism is correct and applicable in industrial contexts. Besides, we observe that the performance of the automation mechanism does not degrade when translating large models with several thousands of elements. Eventually, we conclude that experts in this field find the proposed contribution industrially relevant.

AB  - This paper investigates possibilities to visually support the collaborative design process of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs for Business Application Systems. Starting with a description of the concept of the Social Network of Business Objects (SoNBO), we show how the SoNBO Visualiser supports the visualisation of a company-specific ontology and the resulting knowledge graph. Our previous research showed that existing visualisation tools from the Semantic Web are unsuited for the human involvement that is required in the design of an ontology for a SoNBO. In order to address the lack of a tool, the SoNBO Visualiser was developed using a Design Science Research approach. This paper aims to provide a methodological as well as a technical contribution: The method provides support for the visualisation of the ontology (on two levels) and facilitates the involvement of domain experts (employees) without technical knowledge in the design process. The complementary technical solution connects heterogeneous source systems in a simple configuration process and allows to visualise the ontology and the resulting knowledge graph.

AB  - Scientific knowledge on autonomous-driving technology is expanding at a faster-than-ever pace. As a result, the likelihood of incurring information overload is particularly notable for researchers, who can struggle to overcome the gap between information processing requirements and information processing capacity. We address this issue by adopting a multi-granulation approach to latent knowledge discovery and synthesis in large-scale research domains. The proposed methodology combines citation-based community detection methods and topic modelling techniques to give a concise but comprehensive overview of how the autonomous vehicle (AV) research field is conceptually structured. Thirteen core thematic areas are extracted and presented by mining the large data-rich environments resulting from 50 years of AV research. The analysis demonstrates that this research field is strongly oriented towards examining the technological developments needed to enable the widespread rollout of AVs, whereas it largely overlooks the wide-ranging sustainability implications of this sociotechnical transition. On account of these findings, we call for a broader engagement of AV researchers with the sustainability concept and we invite them to increase their commitment to conducting systematic investigations into the sustainability of AV deployment. Sustainability research is urgently required to produce an evidence-based understanding of what new sociotechnical arrangements are needed to ensure that the systemic technological change introduced by AV-based transport systems can fulfill societal functions while meeting the urgent need for more sustainable transport solutions.

We examine leadership within the dominant areas of OM research in Asia and chart the patterns of growth in research from Asia over the years 2001–2015. The results show that the Asian countries/regions of China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, and South Korea account for a major portion of the papers having authorship from Asia. We find a number of authors and institutions from these leading Asian countries/regions ranking high on various network centrality measures and serving as hubs of connectivity and productivity in research. Asian OM research is found to be focused most on the areas of supply chain management, quality management, and manufacturing. Our examination reveals a trend of rapid increase in the number of papers with Asian authorship appearing in these journals and countries/regions of the Asia Pacific gaining prominence in the global OM research domain. We identify and discuss country and regional focus in OM research from Asia, emerging trends, and future research opportunities.

AB  - The nanotechnology revolution offers many expectations for the improvement of medicine treatments. At present, nanomedicine (NM) development is hampered by methodological barriers for a better characterization and a wider understanding of their in vivo behavior. While regulatory agencies setup guidelines to support NM translation from bench to bedside, the gap is still hardly overcome by main nanomedicines. One lever for filling this gap is a better characterization, thus increasing the global knowledge about the NM itself but also validate the confidence in terms of batch to batch reproducibility of such complex nano-objects. Here, we review the current methodologies routinely used for clinical release of nanomedicine batches in compliance with official guidelines. We confront them to the extreme sharpness of biological systems and finally discuss future possible orientations for a better characterization of NMs, needed to bridge the gap between physicochemical properties and biological fate.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for classifying operations management-related issues for returnable transport items (RTI). RTI closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) issues are classified into three categories. Our proposal is based on a global literature review in the field of CLSC and reverse logistics (RL), with a specific focus on transport items reuse. We also derive our work from observations made in the automotive industry. The motivation for dealing with this topic is that more and more companies are adopting RTIs in their supply chain, and despite the growing attention that CLSC and RL research have gained during the last years, the focus is still more oriented toward remanufacturing issues. The objectives of this paper are twofold. Firstly, to provide practitioners with a clear vision on different issues that arise when implementing a RTI system from an operations management point of view, and secondly, to give suggestions to researchers regarding existing gaps that still need to be filled in this field.

AB  - Purpose
While high-quality information is critical in decision-making for environmental issues and assessing the impact of natural disasters, there is a significant lack of research on how environmental information systems (EISs) can be integrated through service-oriented architecture (SOA). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the EISs in South Korea and to propose an SOA to improve the quality of EISs.
Design/methodology/approach
This study follows the design science research methodology proposed by Peffers et al. (2007). A pilot test was conducted with Environmental Impact Assessment Support System (EIASS) end users based on the modified DeLone and McLean’s IS success model to discern the moderating effect of SOA readiness.
Findings
This study proposed a new SOA for the South Korea EIASS; the work processes among EIASS, nationwide EISs and local EISs are also analyzed. Conceptual and hardware SOA for the EIASS were presented. The finding shows that SOA readiness has a significant moderating effect for EIASS end user benefits.
Practical implications
Supply chain managers can exploit GIS-based environmental information, which can be provided by the new EIASS architecture, to estimate the risk of a natural disaster within the geographical region of their supply chain.
Originality/value
This is one of the few studies in the EIS literature that propose an SOA to improve the quality of EIS. In addition, the study remodeled DeLone and McLean’s IS success model to assess the proposed SOA for EAISS and found that the new SOA would be useful for end users.

AB  - An integral application of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 in the job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) must contemplate the automation and autonomy of the involved decision-making processes as a goal, which is the main purpose of the smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS) paradigm. In a real production context, uncertainty acts as a barrier that hinders this goal being met and, therefore, any SMS model should integrate uncertainty generators in one way or another. This paper proposes an ontological framework that identifies and structures the entities shaping the joint domain formed by the job-shop scheduling process in its itinerary toward the SMS paradigm, the sources of uncertainty that it faces, and the interrelationship type that link these entities. This ontological framework will serve in future research as a conceptual basis to design new quantitative models that, from a holistic perspective, will address the stochasticity of manufacturing environments and incorporate the management of disturbances into the realtime resolution of automatic and autonomous job-shop scheduling.

AB  - Wildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses. These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs — topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.

AB  - Context
The current studies on IoT in healthcare have reviewed the uses of this technology in a combination of healthcare domains, including nursing, rehabilitation sciences, ambient assisted living (AAL), medicine, etc. However, no review study has scrutinized IoT advances exclusively in medicine irrespective of other healthcare domains.
Objectives
The purpose of the current study was to identify and map the current IoT developments in medicine through providing graphical/tabular classifications on the current experimental and practical IoT information in medicine, the involved medical sub-fields, the locations of IoT use in medicine, and the bibliometric information about IoT research articles.
Methods
In this systematic mapping study, the studies published between 2000 and 2018 in major online scientific databases, including IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed were screened. A total of 3679 papers were found from which 89 papers were finally selected based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results
While the majority of medical IoT studies were experimental and prototyping in nature, they generally reported that home was the most popular place for medical IoT applications. It was also found that neurology, cardiology, and psychiatry/psychology were the medical sub-fields receiving the most IoT attention. Bibliometric analysis showed that IEEE Internet of Things Journal has published the most influential IoT articles. India, China and the United States were found to be the most involved countries in medical IoT research.
Conclusions
Although IoT has not yet been employed in some medical sub-fields, recent substantial surge in the number of medical IoT studies will most likely lead to the engagement of more medical sub-fields in the years to come. IoT literature also shows that the ambiguity of assigning a variety of terms to IoT, namely system, platform, device, tool, etc., and the interchangeable uses of these terms require a taxonomy study to investigate the precise definition of these terms. Other areas of research have also been mentioned at the end of this article.

AB  - The management of uncertainty in decision-making problems remains a very challenging and timely research issue despite many proposals. An interesting topic in this area in recent years has been Granular Computing. In this paper, we present a coherent framework for various models of information granules, using hierarchies of information for dealing with knowledge acquired and processed at different levels of abstraction. Granular Computing, a paradigm for handling higher types of uncertainty in decision analysis, is considered a new conceptual and algorithmic asset of decision-making studies and, in particular, data-driven decision-making. Most relevant studies have focused on categories of information granules, namely intervals, fuzzy sets, rough sets, and shadowed sets. To better understand this promising area, this study provides a comprehensive overview of Granular Computing for decision-making through literature analysis, enhancing a variety of extensions, applications, and challenges.

AB  - The arrival of different renewable energy and storage technologies with lower costs is helping smaller communities to gain access to affordable electricity resources through energy systems fed from heterogeneous generation resources. With the growing popularity of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES), a novel kind of end-user software tool has also emerged to help planners optimize such energy installations. At the same time, there is an increase in the number of research articles that warn about the need for considering social indicators such as job creation and social acceptance when designing HRESs in addition to the usual considerations of economical, technical, and environmental criteria. Consequently, the design of HRESs could also be optimized by adding such new social parameters. Mainly, this article presents a complete review of the most popular tools for designing HRESs, and the main conclusion of this survey is that these tools do not consider social factors which is a real opportunity to boost the capabilities of such software packages. Also, this research provides valuable information for the developers of HRES optimization tools, providing them, on the one hand, with insights about the advantages of including social parameters during technology assessment and, on the other hand, with a guide to help them with selecting the most pertinent tool at each case, allowing designers to make the most of the socio-demographic structures and obtain more advantages from local renewable resources.

AB  - Context: Software Product Lines (SPL) evolve when there are changes in the requirements, product structure or the technology being used. Different approaches have been proposed for managing SPL assets and some also address how evolution affects these assets. Existing mapping studies have focused on specific aspects of SPL evolution, but there is no cohesive body of work that gives an overview of the area as a whole. Objective: The goals of this work are to review the characteristics of the approaches reported as supporting SPL evolution, and to synthesize the evidence provided by primary studies about the nature of their processes, as well as how they are reported and validated. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review, considering six research questions formulated to evaluate evolution approaches for SPL. We considered journal, conference and workshop papers published up until March 2017 in leading digital libraries for computer science. Results: After a thorough analysis of the papers retrieved from the digital libraries, we ended up with a set of 60 primary studies. Feature models are widely used to represent SPLs, so feature evolution is frequently addressed. Other assets are less frequently addressed. The area has matured over time: papers presenting more rigorous work are becoming more common. The processes used to support SPL evolution are systematic, but with a low level of automation. Conclusions: Our research shows that there is no consensus about SPL formalization, what assets can evolve, nor how and when these evolve. Case studies are quite popular, but few industrial-sized case studies are publicly available. Also, few of the proposed techniques offer tool support. We believe that the SPL community needs to work together to improve the state of the art, creating methods and tools that support SPL evolution in a more comparable manner.

This study examined the published works related to healthcare robotics for older people using the attributes of health, nursing, and the human-computer interaction framework.
Design
An integrative literature review.
Methods
A search strategy captured 55 eligible articles from databases (CINAHL, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed) and hand-searching approaches. Bibliometric and content analyses grounded on the health and nursing attributes and human-computer interaction framework were performed using MAXQDA. Finally, results were verified using critical friend feedback by a second reviewer.
Results
Most articles were from multiple authorship, published in non-nursing journals, and originating from developed economies. They primarily focused on applying healthcare robots in practice settings, physical health, and communication tasks. Using the human-computer interaction framework, it was found that older adults frequently served as the primary users while nurses, healthcare providers, and researchers functioned as secondary users and operators. Research articles focused on the usability, functionality, and acceptability of robotic systems. At the same time, theoretical papers explored the frameworks and the value of empathy and emotion in robots, human-computer interaction and nursing models and theories supporting healthcare practice, and gerontechnology. Current robotic systems are less anthropomorphic, operated through real-time direct and supervisory inputs, and mainly equipped with visual and auditory sensors and actuators with limited capability in performing health assessments.
Conclusion
Results communicate the need for technological competency among nurses, advancements in increasing healthcare robot humanness, and the importance of conscientious efforts from an interdisciplinary research team in improving robotic system usability and utility for the care of older adults.

AB  - The increasing worldwide demand for freshwater production requires new and sustainable processes to overcome the shortage of clean water. Reverse osmosis (RO) is regarded as the most efficient type of desalination technology and proper knowledge of mathematical modeling of the RO system can help in developing advanced RO systems. Currently, with high computational capability, it is possible to predict how a system will behave in specific conditions without testing experimentally. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of current developments in the RO modeling. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper published so far which has covered the modeling in overall RO processes. The study includes basic theories for RO processes and different models based on the membrane configurations like spiral wound, hollow fiber, and tubular. The paper also discusses different mathematical models of RO concerning the solvent flux, solute flux, membrane fouling, energy consumption, nanomaterial incorporation in membrane, hybrid technologies with RO, and zero liquid discharge to enhance the performance of RO system. It is observed that these models could assist in optimizing the design as well as the operation of the systems to increase efficiency, decrease the consumption of energy and enhance the quality of water obtained. Further, predictive models could be developed for forecasting the performance of systems and contribute early warning of possible problems like scaling, fouling, and membrane degradation.

AB  - Traceability has emerged as a prime requirement for a multi-tier and multi-site production. It enables visibility and caters to the consumer requirements of transparency and quality assurance. Textile and clothing industry is one such example that requires traceability implementation to address prevailing problems of information asymmetry and low visibility. Customers find it difficult to access product data that can facilitate ethical buying practices or assure product authenticity. Besides, it is challenging for stakeholders to share crucial information in an insecure environment with risk of data manipulations and fear of losing information advantage. In this context, this study investigates and proposes a blockchain-based traceability framework for traceability in multi-tier textile and clothing supply chain. It conceptualizes the interaction of supply chain partners, and related network architecture at the organizational level and smart contract and transaction validation rules at the operational level. To illustrate the application of the proposed framework, the study presents an example of organic cotton supply chain using blockchain with customized smart contract and transaction rules. It finally demonstrates the applicability of the developed blockchain by testing it under two parameters. The proposed system can build a technology-based trust among the supply chain partners, where the distributed ledger can be used to store and authenticate supply chain transactions. Further, the blockchain-based traceability system would provide a unique opportunity, flexibility, and authority to all partners to trace-back their supply network and create transparent and sustainable supply chain.

AB  - Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a versatile class of materials with exceptional structural diversity and tunable properties, making them highly attractive for various industrial applications. Since the maturation of the MOF field, characterized by “designed syntheses“ and “reticular chemistry“ pioneered by Yaghi, MOF-based compounds have demonstrated remarkable progress within their 20-year history. Recent years have seen the production of numerous MOF compounds and composites, showcasing their potential in fields such as gas storage, carbon capture, catalysis, batteries, supercapacitors, sensors, drug delivery, bioimaging, atmospheric water harvesting, and food packaging. Patent registrations, an indicator of commercial activity, have significantly increased, especially in China and the US, with substantial private sector involvement. Leading companies like BASF, MOF Technologies, and Promethean Particles are advancing large-scale MOF production. Key challenges for industrial-scale synthesis include optimizing reaction conditions, solvent choice, and production costs. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of MOF composites, focusing on their synthesis, characterization, and deployment in industrial contexts. The integration of MOFs with other materials such as polymers, metals, and carbon-based substances has led to the development of composites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and chemical stability, thereby broadening their applicability. We explore the use of MOF composites in gas storage and separation, catalysis, sensing, and environmental remediation, highlighting key advancements and challenges. Case studies illustrating successful industrial implementations underscore the potential of MOF composites to address critical issues in energy, the environment, and manufacturing. Future perspectives on the scalability, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of MOF composite production are discussed, providing insights into ongoing research and development efforts aimed at overcoming current limitations and unlocking new application domains. Through this exploration, the chapter underscores the transformative impact of MOF composites on industrial processes and their promising role in advancing material science and engineering.

AB  - This paper reviews opportunities for, and barriers to, increasing photovoltaic (PV) deployment on apartment buildings, with a particular focus on the Australian experience. As rapid urbanisation drives increasing housing density, PV penetration in multi-occupancy housing has been limited by comparison with stand-alone housing in many jurisdictions, including in Australia despite its world-leading residential PV penetration. Given the growing commercial attractiveness of residential PV, this also raises equity concerns for apartment households. PV can potentially be installed to supply electricity to common property, to serve individual apartments, or as a resource shared between multiple apartments through embedded networks, local energy trading or ‘behind the meter’ deployment models. Our study undertook a review of the academic literature in this space and of specific Australian regulatory arrangements, as well as conducting a series of semi-structured interviews with a range of relevant stakeholders. Barriers identified include the huge variety amongst existing apartment building stock, demographic factors and knowledge issues. However, the Australian regulatory context - including governance of apartment buildings, regulation of the energy market, and electricity tariff policies - also impacts on the options available to apartment residents. New business models for deploying PV on apartments are emerging, including initiatives from retailers, developers and community energy organisations. While some issues are specific to the Australian context, or to buildings governed under strata-type arrangements, broader lessons can be taken from the Australian experience, including to inform the design of the regulatory framework required to facilitate widespread PV deployment across all residential housing types.

AB  - Molecular dynamics (MD) has evolved into a ubiquitous, versatile and powerful computational method for fundamental research in science branches such as biology, chemistry, biomedicine and physics over the past 60 years. Powered by rapidly advanced supercomputing technologies in recent decades, MD has entered the engineering domain as a first-principle predictive method for material properties, physicochemical processes, and even as a design tool. Such developments have far-reaching consequences, and are covered for the first time in the present paper, with a focus on MD for combustion and energy systems encompassing topics like gas/liquid/solid fuel oxidation, pyrolysis, catalytic combustion, heterogeneous combustion, electrochemistry, nanoparticle synthesis, heat transfer, phase change, and fluid mechanics. First, the theoretical framework of the MD methodology is described systemically, covering both classical and reactive MD. The emphasis is on the development of the reactive force field (ReaxFF) MD, which enables chemical reactions to be simulated within the MD framework, utilizing quantum chemistry calculations and/or experimental data for the force field training. Second, details of the numerical methods, boundary conditions, post-processing and computational costs of MD simulations are provided. This is followed by a critical review of selected applications of classical and reactive MD methods in combustion and energy systems. It is demonstrated that the ReaxFF MD has been successfully deployed to gain fundamental insights into pyrolysis and/or oxidation of gas/liquid/solid fuels, revealing detailed energy changes and chemical pathways. Moreover, the complex physico-chemical dynamic processes in catalytic reactions, soot formation, and flame synthesis of nanoparticles are made plainly visible from an atomistic perspective. Flow, heat transfer and phase change phenomena are also scrutinized by MD simulations. Unprecedented details of nanoscale processes such as droplet collision, fuel droplet evaporation, and CO2 capture and storage under subcritical and supercritical conditions are examined at the atomic level. Finally, the outlook for atomistic simulations of combustion and energy systems is discussed in the context of emerging computing platforms, machine learning and multiscale modelling.

AB  - Although cardiac pathologies are the major cause of death in the world, it remains difficult to provide a reliable diagnosis to prevent heart attacks. Rapid patient care and management in emergencies are critical to prevent dramatic consequences. Thus, relevant biomarkers such as cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides are currently targeted by commercialized Point-Of-Care immunoassays. Key points still to be addressed concern cost, lack of standardization, and poor specificity, which could limit the reliability of the assays. Consequently, alternatives are emerging to address these issues. New probe molecules such as aptamers or molecularly imprinted polymers should allow a reduction in cost of the assays and an increase in reproducibility. In addition, the assay specificity and reliability could be improved by enabling multiplexing through the detection of several molecular targets in a single device.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to assist the elementary visually impaired students to learn to type a word, where the students are initially unable to utilize the computer, thus requiring the application to help the learning process. The process of applying gamification is included understanding the target audience and the context, defining learning objectives, structuring the experience, identify resources, and applying gamification elements. Some typing applications for visually impaired people are consuming braille, touchscreen, and delivered in English. As for some educational-based gamified applications have not supported typing for the blind children especially in Indonesia. Therefore, in this contribution, a novel gamified application for typing is presented. Moreover, this application is delivered in Indonesian language. As a material for typing, this application consumes questions based on the curriculum applied in Indonesia. This model is developed with utilized the Game Development Life Circle (GDLC) method which includes initialization, pre-production, production, testing, and release. The application has been tested on several respondents. The respondents believe that this application is valuable, easy to use, and easy to understand.

AB  - In our days, having all the necessary literature and methods for the implementation of street lighting design, it is possible to propose sustainable solutions that offer benefits in energy saving, the environment and optimization of living conditions. However, so far, research has shown that studies either follow the Standards or are carried out empirically, taking into consideration certain parameters at a time rather than all the parameters concerning a street lighting design. The present work's aim is to elucidate the critical design parameters involved in road lighting analysis, covering both theoretical aspects of the design process and practical implementation in field applications, highlighting their importance in terms of energy savings and their contribution to sustainable development. The analysis concluded in a large number of parameters which form a lighting analysis. It was noted that many researchers tend to adopt an one-sided perspective on the subject by focusing on specific parameters within a single case category. This approach does not provide reliable results regarding the overall energy efficiency and savings of a system. Parameters such as energy indicators, adaptive lighting, road surface characteristics, mesopic vision, etc. require further investigation to explore efficient and sustainable solutions that prioritize both human well-being and environmental impact. Simultaneously, the frequent use of new technologies has led to their overuse, that sometimes has as a concequence the increase of energy consumption and operational cost rather than reducing it. It is also obvious that design loses its value compared with technology that continuously gains ground. At the moment, by having all the relevant information, it seems to be the time to proceed to a new holistic design approach, that combines all the necessary parameters that formulate a road lighting analysis. This approach aims to deliver more accurate results, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable urban environment.
Contribution to science
A systematic scientific literature review on energy management and energy saving in road lighting is conducted, investigating parameters such as energy indicators, adaptive lighting, mesopic vision, road surface, design parameters, on-site elements and technology-equipment that constitute a road lighting study, identifying the lacking points and highlighting the areas for further research towards a more efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly urban environment.

AB  - Machine tools subjected to high demands regarding productivity and accuracy are faced with the challenge that thermal losses influencing the accuracy negatively. Due to high requirements regarding thermal stability of precision related machine tool components, the focused linear direct drives (LDD) must be tempered by active cooling systems. In machine tools, a sufficient cooling capacity is available, but the cooling is insufficiently adjusted to the process and the individual demand of the heat-inducing as well as precision related components. With the intention to achieve a demand-oriented cooling, the use of thermoelectricity in machine tools is one research objective at the Institute for Machine Tools and Factory Management (IWF). Inspired by the concept of thermoelectric self-cooling (TSC)-systems for electronic devices, an Adaptive Cooling (AC)-system with thermoelectric generators (TEG) for LDD in machine tools is developed and experimentally investigated. In order to enhance the performance of AC-systems, in this research a reduction of the global thermal resistance is focused. A promising approach to achieve this goal is the division of the induced heat flow into a primary and a secondary heat path. For a model-based performance analysis of this approach, a system simulation is presented. To acquire experimental data for model validation, a test bench of the AC-system with primary as well as primary and secondary heat path is put into operation. The comparison of simulative and experimental determined data indicates a predominantly high model prediction accuracy. As a result, the implementation of a secondary heat path enables a reduction of the temperature on the upper surface of the heat source by 24.6% and thus a decrease of the global thermal resistance by 38.1%. Compared to the initial state of the AC-system only with primary heat path, the achieved thermal stability in the precision related machine tool component as well as the self-starting capability is improved.

AB  - The KM3NeT Collaboration is currently constructing a multi-site high-energy neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea consisting of matrices of pressure-resistant glass spheres, each holding a set of 31 small-area photomultipliers. The main goals of the telescope are the observation of neutrino sources in the Universe and the measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. A relative time synchronisation between photomultipliers of the nanosecond order needed to guarantee the required angular resolution of the detector. Due to the large detector volumes to be instrumented by KM3NeT, a cost reduction of the different systems is a priority. To this end, the inexpensive Nanobeacon has been designed and developed by the KM3NeT Collaboration to be used for detector time-calibration studies. At present, more than 600 Nanobeacons have been already produced. The characterisation of the optical pulse and the wavelength emission profile of the devices is critical for the time calibration. The optical pulse rise time has been quantified as less than 3 ns, while the Full Width Half Maximum is less than 6 ns. The wavelength drift, due to a variation of the supply voltage, has also been qualified as lower than 10 nm for the full range of the Nanobeacon. In this paper, more details about the main features of the Nanobeacon design, production and operation, together with the main properties of the light pulse generated are described.

AB  - The interest in mechanochemical research has dramatically increased in recent years with the advent of computational chemistry tools where detailed reaction thermodynamics, and kinetics can be studied. However, most chemistry software packages do not address mechanochemical phenomena and computational chemists need to modify a quantum chemical software to perform specialized simulations. Current implementation includes Force Modified Potential Energy Surface (FMPES), External Force Explicitly Included (EFEI), and Enforce Geometry Optimizations (EGO) formalisms. This also includes a wall potential based function to simulate mechanical grinding. In this work, a Python module that allows inclusion of external forces during molecular geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations while virtually employing any quantum chemical or molecular mechanical software is presented. It is expected that OpenMechanochem will facilitate mechanochemical reaction simulations that will explain the interplay of external forces to a chemical system.

AB  - Political decarbonisation commitments and outcompeting renewable electricity costs are disrupting energy systems. This foresight study prepares stakeholders for this dynamic, reactive change by examining visions that constitute a probable, plausible and possible component of future energy systems. Visions were extrapolated through an expert review of energy technologies and Australian case studies. ‘Probable–Abundant’ envisages a high penetration of solar and wind with increased value of balancing services: batteries, pumped hydro and transmission. This vision is exemplified by the South Australian grid, where variable and distributed sources lead generation. ‘Plausible–Traded’ envisages power and power fuel exports given hydrogen and high-voltage direct-current transmission advances, reflected by public and private sector plans to leverage rich natural resources for national and intercontinental exchanges. ‘Possible–Zero’ envisages the application of carbon removal and nuclear technologies in response to the escalating challenge of deep decarbonisation. The Australian critical minerals strategy signals adaptations of high-emission industries to shifting energy resource values. These visions contribute a flexible, accessible framework for diverse stakeholders to discuss uncertain energy systems changes and consider issues from new perspectives. Appraisal of preferred futures allows stakeholders to recognise observed changes as positive or negative and may lead to new planning aspirations.

AB  - As composite materials gain increased usage in the aviation industry, it is important to address crashworthy design of composite aircraft. This chapter describes the facility used for full-scale aircraft crash testing at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley, summarizes the research programs conducted to achieve improved crashworthiness, provides a brief definition of crashworthy design goals, documents existing certification requirements for crashworthiness, and provides a brief discussion of crash modeling and simulation. Next, results of a research program are presented in which two different composite energy absorbers were developed and evaluated through multilevel testing and simulation. One of the energy absorbers was a conical-shaped design, designated the conusoid, that consisted of four layers of hybrid graphite-Kevlar plain weave fabric oriented at [+45/−45/−45/+45 degrees] with respect to the vertical direction. A second sinusoidal-shaped energy absorber, designated the sinusoid, was developed that consisted of hybrid graphite-Kevlar plain weave fabric face sheets, two layers for each face sheet oriented at ±45 degree with respect to the vertical direction, and a closed-cell ELFOAM P200 polyisocyanurate (32.0 kg/m3) foam core. The design goal for the energy absorbers was to achieve average floor-level accelerations of between 25 and 40 g during the full-scale crash test of a retrofitted CH-46E helicopter airframe. Variations in both designs were assessed through dynamic crush testing of component specimens. Once the designs were finalized, subfloor beams of each configuration were fabricated and retrofitted into a barrel section of a CH-46E helicopter. A vertical drop test of the barrel section was conducted onto concrete to evaluate the performance of the energy absorbers. Finite element models were developed of all test articles and simulations were performed using LS-DYNA, a commercial nonlinear explicit transient dynamic finite element code. Test-analysis results are presented for both energy absorbers as comparisons of time-history responses, as well as predicted and experimental structural deformations and progressive damage under impact loading.

AB  - The industrial sector is the one that consumes the most energy in the world, whereas manufacturing activities play an important role in the energy consumption in the industry. The efficient scheduling/planning of production through intelligent operational methods using demand response (DR) can decrease the energy consumption and cost of a production process. However, the implementation of DR in industrial plants is more complex and challenging when compared with residential or commercial consumers. This is because the interruption of services can lead to the interruption of production and/or violation of operational constraints. In order to identify, classify, and summarize the DR applications in the industry, this work carries out an investigation in the form of a systematic mapping, comprising manufacturing and production processes that adopt this type of program. The literature review covers the period from 2013 to June 2022, with a focus on the implementation of DR in the manufacturing processes, as well as in the identification and classification of aspects related to the understanding and formulation of the problem and possible solution strategies. Unlike the existing literature that relates DR and industry, this study focuses specifically on the implementation of DR in manufacturing processes, identifying and classifying the main aspects related to problem modeling and solution strategies. After a rigorous analysis, a taxonomy is proposed based on 53 selected studies, emphasizing the deployment of DR in the industry. The taxonomy is summarized in terms of a graphical notation, highlighting the studies related to each category. Additionally, this work proposes a broader classification comprising loads and workstations in the industry.

AB  - An efficient energy carrier has become crucial as the globe shifts towards renewable energy. Many individuals regard hydrogen as the fuel of the future and a universal clean energy source. Unsurprisingly, the lack of advantages and technological challenges associated with hydrogen storage have resulted in a tardy mainstream adoption of the hydrogen economy. Due to the present commercial technology, which involves keeping H2 in a pressurized and liquified state that demands extremely high pressure and extremely low temperature, storing H2 under safe and operational circumstances continues to be a difficult process. Research on solid-state H2 storage materials is underway to address this issue. Due to its high gravimetric capacity (the mass of borohydride materials release over 10% of H2), borohydride is one of the solid-state H2 storage materials that could be used. Mg(BH4)2, a member of the borohydride family, has a high gravimetric capacity (14.9 wt%), which makes it a promising material for storing hydrogen. Nevertheless, slow sorption kinetics, poor reversibility, and a high thermal breakdown temperature (over 300 °C) prevent its practical utilization. Various approaches have been established so far to enhance the performance of Mg(BH4)2, the primary focus of this review is on the current advancements (for the years 2018–2023). With this objective in mind, we discussed about its synthesis, structure, and additive use to alter Mg(BH4)2property. Our main focus was on the methodologies that were modified to add an additive to Mg(BH4)2, and we concluded by analysing the approaches in light of the US DOE's ultimate target for hydrogen storage.

AB  - Background and Objective:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown significant advancements across several industries, including healthcare, using better fusion methodologies, improved data accessibility, and heightened processing capabilities. Although deep learning algorithms excel in challenging scenarios, their widespread adoption presents a challenge due to their need for more transparency. The advent of Explainable AI (XAI) has addressed this limitation by offering AI-driven systems with attributes such as transparency, interpretability, and reliability. The need for transparency in critical sectors like healthcare has prompted an increased academic focus on investigating and understanding these frameworks. The present paper thoroughly examines the latest research and advancements in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), specifically focusing on its integration into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in healthcare settings. The last section tackles outstanding issues concerning XAI and IoMT and outlines prospective directions for further research.
Methods:
A thorough investigation was carried out across many scholarly databases and online digital libraries, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Wiley Interscience, Taylor and Francis, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, Google Scholar, Citeseer Library, Semantic Scholar, and other relevant sources. An analysis was conducted on articles published from March 2004 to February 2024, specifically focusing on AI models that explain different healthcare issues. The search query included “Explainable AI” in conjunction with “Open Black Box, Healthcare, Transparent Models, Interpretable Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Medical Information System, Accountability, Smart Healthcare, and Responsible AI”, indicating the field’s dynamic nature. The authors also examined various techniques and datasets to elucidate healthcare difficulties, including incorporating the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).
Results:
The evaluation included more than 105 published models that used clinical data input to diagnose diverse disorders, focusing on incorporating Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) components. In addition to illness diagnosis, these models also elucidate the decisions made. The models were classified according to the input data, used methodologies, and integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The categorization included machine learning and deep learning methodologies, particularly on explainability models connected to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). These models were classified as model-agnostic, model-specific, global, local, ante-hoc, and post-hoc.
Conclusion:
This extensive study examines machine learning, and deep learning models developed based on clinical data and associated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for illness detection. These models improve efficiency and accuracy and provide essential assistance to medical personnel. Explaining each choice made by individuals contributes to the acceleration of sickness detection, resulting in decreased medical expenses for patients and healthcare systems. The integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) highlights a fundamental change in healthcare towards more transparent and linked systems, leading to significant breakthroughs in medical decision-making.

KW  - Overlapping coalition formation
AB  - A coalition as a group of agents aims to work jointly to earn much more gains as a result of their cooperation. Many existing studies assumed that members take advantage of joining one coalition at a time, albeit the importance of coalition formation problems. Therefore, more attention to overlapping coalitions needs to be paid to optimise resource management by forming in multiple overlapping coalitions simultaneously. Roughly speaking, the related literature includes two main streams; (i) theoretical foundations of coalition formation games and, (ii) the coalition structure generation problems. This paper first provides a review of coalition structure generation at large to develop a taxonomic framework and classify the existing literature, viz., macro analysis. The paper then reviews studies on overlapping coalitions thoroughly, viz., micro analysis. The micro analysis presents and discusses different models of overlapping coalition games and related solution concepts as well as surveying all problem-solving approaches for overlapping coalition structure generation. Finally, the outstanding challenges and opportunities for future research considerations are discussed and shared.

AB  - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as an architectural approach that enhances the service delivery performance of existing traditional systems while still retaining their most important features. This approach, due to its flexibility of adoption, has gained the attention of both academic and business entities, especially in the development of world-leading technologies such as Cloud Computing (CC) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although many studies have listed the success factors of SOA, a few minor failures have also been reported in the literature. Despite the availability of rich material on SOA, there is a lack of systematic reviews covering the different aspects of the SOA concept in Information Systems (IS) research. Therefore, the central objective of this study is to review existing issues of SOA and share the findings with the academia. Hence, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to analyse existing studies related to SOA and the factors that led to SOA success and failure from 2009 to 2019. To completely cover all SOA-related research in the IS field, a two-stage review protocol that included automatic and manual searching was applied, resulting in 103 primary studies. The articles were categorised into four research themes, namely: SOA Adoption, SOA Concepts, SOA Impact, and SOA Practice. The result shows that the academic research interest on SOA increased recently with most of the articles covering SOA Practice followed by SOA Adoption. Moreover, the findings of this review highlighted SOA Governance, SOA Strategy, Financial Issues and Costs, and Education and Training as the most significant factors of SOA adoption and implementation. Consequently, the outcomes will assist professionals and experts in organisations as well as academic researchers to focus more on these factors for successfully adopting and implementing SOA.

AB  - Cooling towers and chillers are naturally the core of cooling and chilled water system. However, the adequate functioning of these systems relies on auxiliary systems, which are the distribution, pumping, intake, and treatment systems. Water needs to travel from the cooling tower or the chiller to the consumers. Piping routing and sizing usually are done following rules of thumb and best engineering practice to expedite the project. As water requires energy to travel through the circuit, pumps are used for this purpose. As the circuit head often is within the 2.4–4.5bar range, centrifugal pumps are used. Also, since water flow rates are among the largest in the plant, it is very common for the pumping set to be composed of more than one centrifugal pump. The intake system transfers the water from a water source to the circuit, and it is usually sized according to water makeup requirements. In open circuits, the water must be treated to contain biological growth, to avoid fouling, and to inhibit corrosion. Project engineers and plant operation must also be wary of maintenance practices, which are divided into preventive and corrective. The former consists of routine activities, while the latter consists of responsive actions. Moreover, all project engineers must ensure that the cooling and chilled water systems are inherently nonhazardous, or at least it minimizes hazards, regarding safety, health, and environment.

AB  - The development of alternative renewable energy technologies is crucial for alleviating climate change and promoting energy transformation. Of the currently available technologies, solar energy has promising application prospects owing to its merits of being clean, safe, and sustainable. Solar energy is converted into electricity through photovoltaic (PV) cells; however, the overall conversion efficiency of PV modules is relatively low, and most of the captured solar energy is dissipated in the form of heat. This not only reduces the power generation efficiency of solar cells but may also have a negative impact on the electrical parameters of PV modules and the service life of PV cells. To overcome the shortcomings, an efficient approach involves combining a PV cell with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) to form hybrid PV-TEG systems, which simultaneously improve the energy conversion efficiency of the PV system by reducing the operating temperature of the PV modules and increasing the power output by utilizing the waste heat generated from the PV system to generate electricity via the TEGs. Based on a thorough examination of the literature, this study comprehensively reviews 14 maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms currently applied to hybrid PV-TEG systems and classifies them into five major categories for further discussion, namely conventional, mathematics-based, metaheuristic, artificial intelligence, and other algorithms. This review aims to inspire advanced ideas and research on MPPT algorithms for hybrid PV-TEG systems.

AB  - This study introduces a model to predict regional electricity consumption in urban areas with mixed land use patterns and high energy intensity. It employs an agent-based approach to tackle the temporal-spatial and heterogeneity distribution challenges brought about by rapid urbanization. The model evaluates potential shifts in electricity usage driven by occupants’ behavior, considering the urban environment, demographics, and energy policies. Using the GAMA platform, it forecasts electricity consumption for 907 agents in Taipei City, Taiwan. Integrating 5 clusters of 5 independent variables, the model utilizes Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Decision Trees (DT) for analysis. Findings indicate a higher shift likelihood among residential occupants (Cluster 1 and Cluster 4) than commercial occupants (Cluster 2 and Cluster 3), especially in areas with diverse clusters. Consequently, the projected electricity consumption in 2030 is only 2 kWh/household lower than in 2020, underscoring the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality through changes in occupants’ electricity usage behavior in a mature city. Future research aims to enhance accuracy by delving into cluster shift mechanisms and socio-economic backgrounds. Despite the hurdles, the model contributes to understanding urban energy dynamics and informs policy formulation for energy-efficient practices.

Most of the scholarly and practical analysis so far has been taken the claims of this technology being akin to a contract at face value, with legal analysis of contract formation, performance, and enforcement at the forefront of the debate. This article discusses that while smart contracts may pose some interesting legal questions, most of these are irrelevant, and smart contracts should be understood almost strictly from a technical perspective, and that any legal response is entirely dependent on the technical capabilities of the smart contract. The article proposes that smart contracts are not contracts for all practical purposes.

AB  - The development of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) has been motivated by the perceived limitations of fundamentally deterministic and probabilistic approaches to understand complex systems’ behaviour. Congruent with the principles of Resilience Engineering, over recent years the FRAM has been progressively developed in scientific terms, and increasingly adopted in industrial environments with reportedly successful results. Nevertheless, a wide literature review focused on the method is currently lacking. On these premises, this paper aims to summarise all available published research in English about FRAM. More than 1700 documents from multiple scientific repositories were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA review technique. The paper aims to uncover a number of characteristics of the FRAM research, both in terms of the method’s application and of the authors contributing to its development. The systematic analysis explores the method in terms of its methodological aspects, application domains, and enhancements in qualitative and quantitative terms, as well as proposing potential future research directions.

AB  - Blockchain technology has taken on a leading position in today’s industrial applications by providing salient features and showing significant performance since its beginning. Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.

Based on an extensive review of 133 articles from highly-regarded journals, we developed a framework where we highlight the integration of the transition from blockchain technology adoption to its application. This transition process is explained by two theories: the Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusion of Innovation Theory. In the adoption phase, we identified eight internal drivers and seven external drivers, together with comprehensive barriers. Our framework also integrates and examines the blockchain technology application stage, focusing not only on the current development of benefits of blockchain technology implementation but also on the challenges that impede the successful implementation of blockchain technology in supply chain management. The future development prospects are also highlighted which include standardization, platform development, regulation system development, cost reduction, and talent cultivation. These future developments were critical yet were missing in the current academic literature. By providing an in-depth analysis of these challenges, our study can assist supply chain practitioners in making informed decisions about blockchain-enabled supply chain management initiatives.

AB  - Supply chain performance measurement systems (SCPMSs) are experiencing a new life in business practice thanks to new technologies that allow the collecting, integrating and sharing of information among multiple supply chain partners. However, studies that truly investigate performance measurement beyond a single firm's boundaries are still limited. With the purpose of revamping SCPMSs as a relevant research topic, we conduct a systematic review of the literature. To this end, we firstly provide a clear and up-to-date definition of SCPMSs, which sets the boundary of the study. Secondly, we perform a systematic review of academic articles published in peer-reviewed international journals, mostly in the domains of supply chain management and performance measurement. A final sample of 92 articles published from 1998 to 2015 constitutes the knowledge base of the study. The results show the publication pattern over time and provide evidence about the journals, the methodology adopted and the content elements (the SCPMS frameworks presented and the scope and phase of the measurement process). We synthesize the research state of the art and present a detailed research agenda for future scientific contributions. In particular, we envisage a theory-testing approach concerning the relatively more mature component of SCPMSs (i.e. supplier PMSs) from a life cycle perspective as well as an exploratory/theory-building approach concerning the other under-investigated components (i.e. customer PMSs, multi-tier SCPMSs and many-to-many SCPMSs).

AB  - This chapter covers one of the most significant aspects of any modern test environment—the test control and data acquisition system. The justification for the importance of this aspect is because the test cell or facility has only one deliverable that is data. Hence the system for executing the test and collecting the data from and about the unit under test (UUT) plays a pivotal role. The chapter is arranged in sections in order to isolate the key topic areas. The first part covers safety aspects of test cell control and UUT operation, including hazards and appropriate safety legislation. The second part discusses control concepts for the rotating machinery under test, including an introduction to the control theory involved. The third part concerns the test automation software, its function, attributes, and requirements with an introduction to test sequences and editing. The modern concept of road-to-rig testing is introduced. The fourth part covers the data acquisition chain along with an overview of the typical signals and signal processing. System performance definition is also stated in this section along with a clarification of the terms used. The fifth part covers data collection, recording, transfer, and typical protocols. The sixth part introduces virtual and model-based testing, highlighting the most important factors to be considered in this area of future-oriented, automated, power train testing.

AB  - This paper seeks to identify the contributions of artificial intelligence (AI) to supply chain management (SCM) through a systematic review of the existing literature. To address the current scientific gap of AI in SCM, this study aimed to determine the current and potential AI techniques that can enhance both the study and practice of SCM. Gaps in the literature that need to be addressed through scientific research were also identified. More specifically, the following four aspects were covered: (1) the most prevalent AI techniques in SCM; (2) the potential AI techniques for employment in SCM; (3) the current AI-improved SCM subfields; and (4) the subfields that have high potential to be enhanced by AI. A specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify and examine papers from four SCM fields: logistics, marketing, supply chain and production. This paper provides insights through systematic analysis and synthesis.

In the study, 64 publications between 2006 and 2019 where reviewed and classified according to a schema developed using thematic analysis of the selected publications. Among the findings were that the typical publication evaluates through simulation benefits for the equipped vehicle, leaving considerable gaps in investigations of societal effects. Additionally, there is a lack of investigation on driver behaviour, both for the equipped vehicle and for fellow road users—the ability to accurately model such behaviour is necessary for reliable simulation results.

AB  - Frost poses a major threat to agricultural economies through its adverse impact on crop yields. Smart and high-efficiency frost management including pre-frost prediction, in-process monitoring, timely protection, and post-frost evaluation can assist growers in mitigating the impact of frost damage. Due to the unpredictable characteristics of frost, traditional management strategies have limited capacity to timely and autonomously implement frost protection methods. In recent years, the development of machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPS), mathematical modeling, and cutting-edge robotics i.e., unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) allows great improvements of frost protection performance. This review presents a comprehensive survey of these state-of-the-art technologies applied to frost management in plants. Of the 253 papers reviewed, 8.7% were published before 2000, 13.4% and 45.1% were published between 2001 and 2010 and between 2011 and 2020, and 32.8% were published after 2020, suggesting that this research area is rapidly growing in recent decades. In this survey, we found that fruit trees and arable crops were the most studied frost-damaged crop types, accounting for 41.4% and 25.3% of the research papers specifying the studied crops. The machine learning-powered frost forecasting and IoT/CPS-based frost monitoring and protection are discussed. In addition, non-destructive image sensing techniques for post-frost detection and evaluation, and advanced mathematical modeling for the improvement of frost protection performance are analyzed. Finally, the current challenges and the opportunities in future research for integrated, intelligent, and autonomous frost management in large-scale fields are summarized.

AB  - Modeling and simulation are a powerful and effective problem-solving methodology to study how complex real-world systems behave over time. In the literature, many authors have indicated that discrete event simulation, agent-based simulation, and system dynamics are the primary and most important simulation techniques to aid industrial engineers in making decisions. Given this context, this paper is expected to be an introductory guide, especially for novice simulation modelers willing to work with hybrid simulation, by providing knowledge and insight about the primary simulation methods in industrial engineering. This paper is expected to support the decision about which simulation technique best suits the system being studied. For that, a systematic literature review was conducted based on pre-defined search criteria. After applying the filters and including some relevant papers published in the field, a total of 145 papers were selected. Some of the analysis performed in this study include, for each simulation method, the number of publications over the years and a list of the top 10 sources, countries, and authors according to the number of publications. Besides that, a brief history is provided and the definition of the three primary techniques is discussed, as well as the main characteristics of each technique, such as modeling steps, elements, conceptual modeling tools used, software, inputs and outputs, programming languages, advantages, disadvantages, and application areas. Simulation modelers can use this paper as a quick reference to the primary simulation techniques in order to identify the best tool for a specific simulation project in the field of industrial engineering and related areas.

AB  - In the realm of data protection, a striking disconnect prevails between traditional domains of doctrinal, legal, theoretical, and policy-based inquiries and a burgeoning body of empirical evidence. Much of the scholarly and regulatory discourse remains entrenched in abstract legal principles or normative frameworks, leaving the empirical landscape uncharted or minimally engaged. Since the birth of EU data protection law, a modest body of empirical evidence has been generated but remains widely scattered and unexamined. Such evidence offers vital insights into the effectiveness of data protection measures but languishes on the periphery, inadequately integrated into the broader conversation. To make a meaningful connection, we conduct a comprehensive review and synthesis of empirical research spanning nearly three decades (1995 - March 2022), advocating for a more robust integration of empirical evidence into the evaluation and review of the GDPR while laying a methodological foundation for coordinated research. By categorising evidence into four distinct groups– Awareness and Trust, Operational Performance, Ripple Effect, and Normative Clarity, we provide a structured analysis therein and highlight the variety and nuances of the empirical evidence produced about the GDPR. Our discussion offers critical reflections on the current orientations and designs of evaluation work, challenging some popular but misguided orientations that significantly influence public debate and even direction of empirical and doctrinal research. This synthesis also sheds light on several understated aspects, surfaced by our systematic review, including the complex structure of the GDPR and the internal contradictions between components, the GDPR's interaction with other normative values and legal frameworks, as well as unintended consequences imposed by the GDPR on other values not explicitly recognised as regulatory objectives (such as innovation). We further propose a methodological improvement in how empirical evidence can be generated and utilised, stressing the need for more guided, coordinated and rigorous empirical research. By re-aligning empirical focus towards these ends and establishing strategic coordination at the community level, we seek to inform and underpin evaluative work that aligns empirical inquiries with policy and doctrinal needs, while truly reflecting the complexities and challenges of safeguarding personal data in the digital age.

AB  - The combustion of hydrogen is a viable mobile power source with zero carbon consequences, or if the hydrogen is judiciously mixed with natural gas, with potentially carbon neutral implications. As described in this article, there are a number of technologies available to use hydrogen as a propulsion fuel. The ones specifically discussed are reciprocating internal combustion engines for land transportation and rotating detonation engines for rocket based space flight, in expectation of increasing space flight frequency. The implementation of these technologies will require further research, as discussed in this article, focusing on the characteristics of hydrogen laminar flames such as their speeds and extinction strain rates at engine relevant conditions. Implementation also requires research to obtain a definitive H2/O2 chemical kinetic mechanism. The mechanism needs to be comprehensively derived from a wide variety of experiments and theoretical calculations. It should also be universally predictive of ignition delays measured in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, and predictive of output species in jet stirred reactors, flow reactor species profiles, shock tube species, as well as laminar flame speeds and related flame characteristics over wide temperature and pressure ranges of engine relevance. On a practical level, hydrogen storage and handling for engine use is a major safety concern requiring further research, as is discussed.

AB  - In the past few years, we have witnessed a reinvigorated interest by academics, practitioners and policymakers in the ecosystem concept. Recent reviews have set out to clarify the conceptual boundaries between ecosystem concepts. Yet there is still a lack of clarity when it comes to which ecosystem types can best help organisations achieve various goals. This systematic literature review advances our understanding of the conceptual boundaries between different ecosystems and, more importantly, identifies which types of ecosystems are suitable for achieving the goals. We focus on four commonly studied ecosystem types: business, innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge ecosystems. The key findings centre on systematically demarcating the ecosystem types by accounting for (and distinguishing between) their conceptual boundaries and goals. The results show how multifaceted ecosystem goals are and reveal several shifts in the literature on ecosystem types over time. Our review establishes a thematic agenda for future research with practical outlook.

AB  - As subsidised feed-in-tariffs for distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation are reduced or abolished in many jurisdictions, there is growing interest in increasing self-consumption to realise greater value from rooftop PV generation. However, deployment of PV on apartment buildings lags behind other residential deployment despite the potential advantages of load aggregation. We present a study of electricity and financial flows in ten ‘virtual’ Australian apartment buildings under a range of technical implementations and financial arrangements, using real load profiles and simulated generation profiles. Aggregation of diverse household and shared loads, either through an embedded network or ‘behind the meter’ of individual dwellings, can increase self-sufficiency and self-consumption of on-site generation compared to separate systems supplying common property or individual apartments. While embedded networks can enable access to more beneficial retail arrangements, behind the meter solutions may allow residents to avoid regulatory complexities and additional costs. The relative benefits of each arrangement are dependent on building characteristics and financial settings.

AB  - Background
The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide and the high recent mortality rates (74.4%) associated with them, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is causing a substantial global burden of disease, necessitating innovative and sustainable long-term care solutions.
Objective
This scoping review aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)–based conversational agents (CAs)—including chatbots, voicebots, and anthropomorphic digital avatars—as human-like health caregivers in the remote management of NCDs as well as identify critical areas for future research and provide insights into how these technologies might be used effectively in health care to personalize NCD management strategies.
Methods
A broad literature search was conducted in July 2023 in 6 electronic databases—Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science—using the search terms “conversational agents,” “artificial intelligence,” and “noncommunicable diseases,” including their associated synonyms. We also manually searched gray literature using sources such as ProQuest Central, ResearchGate, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. We included empirical studies published in English from January 2010 to July 2023 focusing solely on health care–oriented applications of CAs used for remote management of NCDs. The narrative synthesis approach was used to collate and summarize the relevant information extracted from the included studies.
Results
The literature search yielded a total of 43 studies that matched the inclusion criteria. Our review unveiled four significant findings: (1) higher user acceptance and compliance with anthropomorphic and avatar-based CAs for remote care; (2) an existing gap in the development of personalized, empathetic, and contextually aware CAs for effective emotional and social interaction with users, along with limited consideration of ethical concerns such as data privacy and patient safety; (3) inadequate evidence of the efficacy of CAs in NCD self-management despite a moderate to high level of optimism among health care professionals regarding CAs’ potential in remote health care; and (4) CAs primarily being used for supporting nonpharmacological interventions such as behavioral or lifestyle modifications and patient education for the self-management of NCDs.
Conclusions
This review makes a unique contribution to the field by not only providing a quantifiable impact analysis but also identifying the areas requiring imminent scholarly attention for the ethical, empathetic, and efficacious implementation of AI in NCD care. This serves as an academic cornerstone for future research in AI-assisted health care for NCD management.

AB  - A boil water advisory (BWA) informs the public that there is an increased level of risk associated with their water and that they should boil it before consuming. Studies show that small communities in Canada are particularly likely to experience repeat and long-term BWAs. Climate change has led to changes in precipitation and temperature patterns, leading to region-specific impacts such as increased frequency, severity, or variance in floods, forest fires, droughts, freezing rain, and sea water intrusion. Academic and non-academic “grey” literature was reviewed to establish the most likely impacts of climate change on water treatment and infrastructure. Anonymized data from public drinking water systems in Canada was analyzed to determine the most common causes of BWAs between 2005 and 2020. Most BWAs reported were related to breakdowns/malfunctions along the distribution, though inadequate disinfection residual and turbidity or coliforms in the treated water were also common. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the data showed seasonal trends in some of these parameters. The results of this study suggest that increased precipitation, flooding, permafrost degradation, and forest fires are likely to have significant impacts on water safety in Canada.
Highlights:
Climate change effects are expected to worsen many current water challenges.Climate change will disproportionately impact small, rural, and remote water utilities.Water distribution systems are the main source of water safety risk in Canada.Groundwater-supplied systems experience a disproportionate number of BWAs.Seasonal trends in BWA reasons provide opportunities for targeted mitigation.

AB  - The regulation of process safety is described, with emphasis on the oil and gas industry. The migration of the general approach from prescriptive legislation to the currently favored goal setting/safety case method is described, as are the steps involved in developing a typical safety case. Some examples of equipment used to ensure process safety are given, which are of two basic types—that for which its failure would cause a major accident, and that which is intended to prevent or mitigate the effects of a major accident. The current regulatory regimes utilized to ensure process safety in several countries are described. The causes of several infamous process accidents are evaluated, particularly with respect to whether effectively implemented regulation could have prevented them. The general role of classification societies in chemical process safety is described, as are some of the project management and organizational processes utilized for megaprojects by one classification society, Lloyd's Register. The work's overall conclusion is that, while effectively implemented regulation, whether prescriptive or goal setting in nature, can play a significant role in process safety, implementation failures can, and do lead to accidents with devastating consequences.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence as a Service ('AIaaS') will play a growing role in society's technological infrastructure, enabling, facilitating, and underpinning functionality in many applications. AIaaS providers therefore hold significant power at this infrastructural level. We assess providers’ position in EU law, focusing on assignment of controllership for AIaaS processing chains in data protection law and the availability to providers of protection from liability for customers’ illegal use of AIaaS. We argue that in data protection law, according to current practice, providers are often joint controllers with customers for aspects of the AIaaS processing chain. We further argue that providers lack protection from liability for customers’ illegal activity. More fundamentally, we conclude that the role of providers in customer's application functionality – as well as the significant power asymmetries between providers and customers – challenges traditional understandings of roles and responsibilities in these complex, networked, dynamic processing environments. Finally, we set out some relevant issues for future regulation of AIaaS. In all, AIaaS requires attention from academics, policymakers, and regulators alike.

AB  - The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.

AB  - This chapter presents medical device standards and their impact on the medical device design process. Although standards have been presented in multiple previous chapters in the text, this chapter explores the various types of standards and standards organizations, the mechanisms by which standards are written, approved, disseminated, and almost universally adopted. Technical standards are especially critical in health care because regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA ), and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, will only clear healthcare products for clinical use that satisfy a specific set of standards related to technology being developed. Most standards are created by one or more standard development organizations (SDOs), which number over 100. In addition to technical standards, there are those that formalize the design processes. One primary standard for health care is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Specifically, ISO 13485 (Medical devices—Quality management systems—Requirements for regulatory purposes), is a primary quality systems standard for medical device companies and includes design controls that impact how medical devices are designed and developed. The chapter explains how design controls formalize the design process and concludes with an example where standards guide a calibration test needed for accuracy.

AB  - Objective:
To determine whether smart conversational agents can be used for detection of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, we reviewed the technologies used, targeted mental disorders and validation procedures of relevant proposals in this field.
Methods:
We searched Scopus, PubMed, Pro-Quest, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on neuropsychiatric disorders and involved conversational data for detection and diagnosis. They were assessed for eligibility by independent reviewers and ultimately included if a consensus was reached about their relevance.
Results:
2356 references were initially retrieved. Eventually, 17 articles – referring 9 smart conversational agents – met the inclusion criteria. Out of the selected studies, 7 are targeted at neurocognitive disorders, 7 at depression and 3 at other conditions. They apply diverse technological solutions and analysis techniques (82.4% use Artificial Intelligence), and they usually rely on gold standard tests for criterion validity assessment. Acceptability, reliability and other aspects of validity were rarely addressed.
Conclusion:
The use of smart conversational agents for the detection of neuropsychiatric disorders is an emerging and promising field of research, with a broad coverage of mental disorders and extended use of AI. However, the few published studies did not undergo robust psychometric validation processes. Future research in this field would benefit from more rigorous validation mechanisms and standardized software and hardware platforms.

AB  - The demand for wood biofuel for district heating plants and combined heat and power plants (CHPs) has increased, caused by an increase in both the number and size of CHPs. This places large demands on the logistics system supplying these plants with fuel, with a particular interest in the use of alternative modes of transport such as rail and sea. The aim of this paper is to identify the industry actors’ requirements, constraints, and preferences regarding the wood-biofuel supply chain and to identify the logistical challenges this entails, as well as how this impacts the opportunity for an increased use of alternative transport solutions. A survey was sent to all Swedish CHPs, combined with six interviews with transport companies, terminal operators, and forest companies. The study shows that the industry has a local focus that limits potential logistics and sourcing solutions. It is also challenged by urban sprawl, with expanding residential areas close to the CHPs putting further constraints on the operations. Significant variations in fuel demand, depending on unpredictable outside temperature and seasonal variation, is a further challenge. The low density of the fuel has a negative impact on transport costs and introduces a trade-off between chipping close to the forest to increase density versus more efficient chipping at the CHP. Intermodal transport only used by large plants, driven by a shortage of local fuel.

AB  - The agile approach to software development has significantly impacted the industry, given its ability to cope with requirements. Despite this, many aspects of the agile paradigm’s compatibility with various software project characteristics have not been thoroughly researched. To address this lacuna, the study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that aims to assess the compatibility of the agile methodology with each of the knowledge areas included in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). By employing Machine Learning (ML) text-mining and sentiment analysis techniques, the paper explores the sentiment regarding each PMBOK knowledge area (PM-KA). It thus provides valuable insights to assist practitioners and researchers in assessing the compatibility of the agile methodology with each PM-KA and identifying potential gaps or significant challenges within the agile paradigm.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the practical application of Lean with Six Sigma and Agile to create a powerful, synergetic and novel process improvement (PI) method. Going beyond the traditional definitions of Lean, we establish a Factory Physics view of PI which doesn't technically discriminate Lean from non-Lean. We apply a design science approach to help a global bank deploy a continuous process improvement program. By reviewing the literature on PI, we recognize Lean additives viz., Lean Six Sigma and Lean Agile, when synergized, help overcome the limitations of individual PI practices. Our design takes its roots from Factory Physics (FP) and emerges as a novel model synthesizing the theoretical lens of FP with Lean additives for field application. Besides the design of ‘Lean Additives Program’, we deployed the model in several iterations, and studied its performance over a three-year period. The improved system exhibited high levels of efficiency and effectiveness. The longitudinal case evidence demonstrates that Lean additives offer both operational and strategic benefits in firms.

AB  - Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Visual Odometry (VO), and Structure from Motion (SFM) are techniques that have emerged recently to address the problem of reconstructing objects or environments using monocular cameras. Monocular pure visual techniques have become attractive solutions for 3D reconstruction tasks due to their affordability, lightweight, easy deployment, good outdoor performance, and availability in most handheld devices without requiring additional input devices. In this work, we comprehensively overview the SLAM, VO, and SFM solutions for the 3D reconstruction problem that uses a monocular RGB camera as the only source of information to gather basic knowledge of this ill-posed problem and classify the existing techniques following a taxonomy. To achieve this goal, we extended the existing taxonomy to cover all the current classifications in the literature, comprising classic, machine learning, direct, indirect, dense, and sparse methods. We performed a detailed overview of 42 methods, considering 18 classic and 24 machine learning methods according to the ten categories defined in our extended taxonomy, comprehensively systematizing their algorithms and providing their basic formulations. Relevant information about each algorithm was summarized in nine criteria for classic methods and eleven criteria for machine learning methods to provide the reader with decision components to implement, select or design a 3D reconstruction system. Finally, an analysis of the temporal evolution of each category was performed, which determined that the classical-sparse-indirect and classical-dense-indirect categories have been the most accepted solutions to the monocular 3D reconstruction problem over the last 18 years.

AB  - Human error in manual assembly systems affects system reliability, safety and it is one of the most important causes of quality defects. Many researchers have developed methods for Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) with the aim of identifying, modeling, quantifying and reducing human error, mainly in safety-critical industries. This paper addresses human reliability analysis in assembly systems, where most of the employed workforce is currently involved. The main purpose is to systematically investigate the current state-of-the-art on this topic, analyzing and summarizing the theoretical and empirical contents, identifying patterns and research streams, informing the strengths and weakness of selected literature and so highlighting the research and practice opportunities. The results of this study show that a prospective analysis of human reliability in the manual assembly systems until now has been neglected in literature. Nevertheless, HRA methods and assembly specific methodologies and approaches found in literature can be successfully applied to assembly systems, allowing users to predict human error probability and to determine the most significant error influencing factors. Furthermore, the results highlight the role of human error in the occurrence of quality defects (rejected or reworking). This paper, therefore, contributes to the transfer of knowledge about human reliability gained in manual assembly operations, providing practitioners and researchers with a comprehensive overview of this topic and several research opportunities for future studies.

AB  - Choking causes over 5,000 deaths per year in the US. During a choking incident, permanent damage to the brain, vital organs, and nervous system can occur in as little as four minutes. In order to provide lifesaving medical treatment for choking victims, we rely on emergency medical services (EMS) and bystander aid. Since the average EMS response time is over seven minutes, bystander intervention can be critical to prevent permanent damage. Even when bystanders are trained in choking first aid, many individuals assume that someone else is more qualified to help and thus will not intervene. In order to combat this problem, we present BBAid: the first smartwatch based system that provides real-time feedback on the back blow portion of choking first aid while instructing the user on first aid procedure. We evaluated our application through two user studies involving 20 subjects and 200 back blow events. The results of our study shows that BBAid achieves a classification accuracy of 93.75% for back blows. With the use of BBAid, participants in our study achieved were able to perform back blows within the recommended range 75% of the time. Comparatively the participants trained with a video only reached that range 12% of the time. All participants in the study, after receiving training were much more willing to perform choking first aid.

AB  - Polymer or Plastic Optical Fiber sensors (POFs) and Fiber Bragg Grating sensors (FBGs) have gained increasing popularity in biomedical engineering (BME) applications over the past decades due to their unique properties such as compact size, lightweight, wide dynamic range, biocompatibility, electromagnetic and radio frequency interference immunity, high strain sensitivity, and multiplexing capabilities. The POF sensor flexibility, low Young's modulus (sensitivity to mechanical changes), higher elastic limits, and higher impact resistance make it suitable for instrumentation requirements in medical devices and biological analysis and measurements. Medical applications for POFs and FBGs have been demonstrated by developing instruments, gait assistance devices, wearables, and biosensors. This paper presents an ambitious review of the current state of the art of POF and FBG-based measuring techniques based on optical multicore fibers (MCF) or multiple optical single-core fibers with embedded FOS sensors. It comprehensively analyses how various sensor variants have been used in medical, healthcare, and remote sensing applications. The review comprises a range of aspects, which include: (I) research methodology; (II) an overview of POF and FBG sensing technology; (III) applications of POFs and FBGs in BME applications; (IV) current state and future trends of POFs and FBGs in the field of BME. The BME applications discussed include applications of POFs and FBGs in; (1) physiological parameter monitoring; (2) biomechanics; (3) foot plantar pressure assessment; (4) gait assistance wearable devices and rehabilitation robotics; (5) joint angle measurement and human movement assessment; (6) health diagnosis; (7) robotic medical microsurgery; and (8) temperature monitoring during thermal ablation treatment.

AB  - Context:
The adoption of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is usually only based on its theoretical benefits instead of empirical evidences. In fact, there is no work that synthesizes the empirical studies on SPLE. This makes it difficult for researchers to base their contributions on previous works validated with an empirical strategy.
Objective:
The objective of this work is to discover and summarize the studies that have used empirical evidences in SPLE limited to those ones with the intervention of humans. This will allow evaluating the quality and to know the scope of these studies over time. Doing so, research opportunities can arise
Methods:
A systematic literature review was conducted. The scope of the work focuses on those studies in which there is human intervention and were published between 2000 and 2018. We considered peer-reviewed papers from journals and top software engineering conferences.
Results:
Out of a total of 1880 studies in the initial set, a total of 62 primary studies were selected after applying a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found that, approximately 56% of the studies used the empirical case study strategy while the rest used experimental strategies. Around 86% of the case studies were performed in an industrial environment showing the penetration of SPLE in industry.
Conclusion:
The interest of empirical studies has been growing since 2008. Around 95.16% of the studies address aspects related to domain engineering while application engineering received less attention. Most of the experiments and case study evaluated showed an acceptable level of quality. The first study found dates from 2005 and since then, the interest in the empirical SPLE has increased.

AB  - Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework of experience co-creation that captures the multi-dimensionality of this construct, as well as a research process for defining of the antecedents of experience co-creation.
Design/methodology/approach
The framework of experience co-creation was conceptualized by means of a literature review. Subsequently, this framework was used as the conceptual basis for a qualitative content analysis of 66 empirical papers investigating alternative consumption models (ACMs), such as renting, remanufacturing, and second-hand models.
Findings
The qualitative content analysis resulted in 12 categories related to the consumer and 9 related to the ACM offerings that represent the antecedents of experience co-creation. These categories provide evidence that, to a large extent, the developed conceptual framework allows one to capture the multi-dimensionality of the experience co-creation construct.
Research limitations/implications
This study underscores the understanding of experience co-creation as a function of the characteristics of the offering – which are, in turn, a function of the consumers’ motives as determined by their lifeworlds – as well as to service design as an iterative approach to finding, creating and refining service offerings.
Practical implications
The investigation of the antecedents of experience co-creation can enable service providers to determine significant consumer market conditions for forecasting the suitability and viability of their offerings and to adjust their service designs accordingly.
Originality/value
This paper provides a step toward the operationalization of the dimension-related experience co-creation construct and presents an approach to defining the antecedents of experience co-creation by considering different research perspectives that can enhance service design research.

AB  - The complexities associated with modern energy grids, including high penetration levels of renewable energy sources at the end use customers, the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), as well as decentralized energy management systems and energy data portals and services, require secure, reliable and cost-effective new platforms to administer such systems in a transparent manner. Blockchain technology can address such challenging complexities efficiently. This paper presents a thorough literature review of all potential blockchain applications in electric energy systems. First, all potential blockchain application possibilities and constraints in electric energy systems have been identified. Then, the implementations of blockchain technology in power systems are divided into various categories, such as demand response (DR), EVs, decentralized energy management, energy trading and distributed renewable energy. A detailed literature analysis is conducted by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a systematic approach using credible and reliable database systems such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to highlight current advancements in blockchain technology uses in electric energy systems particularly in DR, as well as future potential and existing problems. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part lists the important publications that have delved into the implementation of Blockchain in demand response. Trends of Blockchain applications in other electric energy system areas are detailed in the second section. The final part highlights the evolution and advancement of blockchain-based electric energy systems including favourable attributes of structures and designs, as well as the challenges and future trends.

AB  - In recent years, mechanisms of cooperation in power systems have attracted increasing attention from academia and industry. Such mechanisms require sharing the benefits of cooperation among participants based on some rational and obvious principles. In this regard, Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) provides a rich theoretical background for the analysis of projects where participants (called players) can make collective actions to obtain mutual benefits. CGT concepts not only solve the subsequent allocation problems but also reveal the bargaining power of players and estimate the stability of cooperation over a project. In this paper, we aim to classify and promote CGT applications in power systems. While covering a broad range of applications (such as cost and benefit allocation, transmission pricing, projects ranking, allocation of power losses), we pay particular attention to power system expansion planning. We first introduce an illustrative example of cooperation in transmission expansion planning and discuss the applicability of CGT solution concepts. To give a complete picture of the state of the art, we perform a citation network analysis of more than 3000 related studies from 1996 to 2020. Exploiting the graph layout and modularity algorithms, we identify the main research communities and highlight their contributions. We found that significant progress has been achieved in developing mechanisms of cooperation in power systems based on CGT solution concepts. However, several challenges and limitations of these concepts still have to be overcome, such as scalability, nonconvexity of cooperative games, coalitions formation assumption, ex-post game-theoretic analysis, incompleteness and manipulability of information. The overview presented in this paper and the citation network analysis performed can help scientists and engineers in comprehending the CGT solution concepts, discovering novel applications for power systems, and contributing to this promising multidisciplinary research direction.

AB  - This study proposes a newly developed real-time testing system, namely, a tire-pavement dynamic friction analyzer (TDFA), to measure the dynamic friction coefficient between tire and pavement. Based on the self-developed TDFA, the friction coefficient between tire and pavement can be measured in real-time in the lab. A number of working conditions of tires were mimicked and tested. Subsequently, the effect of parameters such as tire load, tire pressure, actual tire-pavement contact area, tire speed, and slip ratio on pavement friction were investigated. It is found that there is a closely linear correlation between the actual tire-pavement contact area and the dynamic friction coefficient (DFC), and such correlation differs with the variation of pavement types. DFC usually has a negative linear relationship to tire speed. As slip ratio varies from 0% to 100%, the strongest correlation between DFC and Mean profile depth (MPD) can be found at the interval of 10%–15% slip ratio, which indicates that the pavement macrotexture also plays a role in the peak value of friction coefficient for the asphalt pavement. This testing method is very promising for the estimation of friction properties of pavement in the phase of lab mix design. It may also be used in the materials selection for pavement design.

AB  - Context
Sustainability is considered as either a quality requirement or a quality characteristic that should be included in software when environmental protection concerns are being taken into account. However, addressing sustainability in software projects might have an impact on the quality of the software product delivered. Conflicting goals between sustainability and particular software product characteristics should be studied when developing application software, since achieving users’ requirements can be a hindrance in the quest to meet sustainability goals.
Objective
This paper aims to provide an overview of the approaches found in the literature for dealing with interactions between software product quality and sustainability in the context of application software.
Method
A systematic mapping study is conducted to identify practices for managing interactions between software quality characteristics and sustainability. The selected papers are classified according to the quality characteristic considered and their influence on sustainability.
Results
Most of the 66 selected papers focused on validating current technologies concerning their support for sustainability (46%%). The interaction between performance efficiency and energy efficiency is what is reported most and there is a fairly positive interaction. In addition, reliability and usability point to a positive interaction with energy efficiency, while security shows a conflicting interaction with energy efficiency. Functional suitability and maintainability can present both positive and negative interaction, with different goals derived from environmental sustainability.
Conclusions
Interactions between software quality and sustainability have been addressed within an explorative approach. There is a need for additional research work to characterize the impact of interaction on both software quality and sustainability. Furthermore, proposals should be validated in industrial settings.

To spread such a revolutionary environment, this systematic review focuses on analyzing extendend reality essence and application and reporting the assessment of 287 approaches gathered from 2011 to 2022, classified and characterized in the proposed taxonomy. Based on the sample of analyzed works, the results indicate that industry 4.0 has embraced the use of these technologies. Heterogeneous solution proposals in various fields of application and activities were found. Notwithstanding, the research articles report similar advantages and benefits (e.g., high performance on human tasks or robot collaboration, high-quality rates for specific products, among others). In addition, we present the most widespread equipment and devices that are currently preferred to develop extended reality applications, which allows us to identify hardware patterns commonly shared in a variety of fields. Whilst, with the aid of association rules, we reveal further insights among the items of the proposed taxonomy. Furthermore, we also present a thorough analysis of trends and research directions in the extended reality field for industry 4.0. Finally, from our results, we show that the accessibility and accelerated progress in technological devices, incorporating advanced algorithms, ergonomic features, built-in cameras, and sensors, have encouraged a massive adoption and extensive application development in a wide spectrum of industry 4.0 domains.

AB  - Background
Anxiety disorders and depression are frequent conditions in childhood and adolescence. eMental healthcare technologies may improve access to services, but their uptake within health systems is limited.
Objective
The objective of this review was to examine and describe how the implementation of eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety disorders and depression in children and adolescents has been studied.
Methods
We conducted a search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature. Eligible studies were those that assessed an eMental healthcare technology for treating or preventing anxiety or depression, included children or adolescents (<18 years), or their parents or healthcare providers and reported findings on technology implementation. The methodological quality of studies was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Outcomes of interest were based on 8 implementation outcomes: acceptability (satisfaction with a technology), adoption (technology uptake and utilization), appropriateness (“fitness for purpose”), cost (financial impact of technology implementation), feasibility (extent to which a technology was successfully used), fidelity (implementation as intended), penetration (“spread” or “reach” of the technology), and sustainability (maintenance or integration of a technology within a healthcare service). For extracted implementation outcome data, we coded favorable ratings on measurement scales as “positive results” and unfavorable ratings on measurement scales as “negative results.” Those studies that reported both positive and negative findings were coded as having “mixed results.”
Results
A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were rated as very good to excellent in methodological quality. These studies investigated eMental healthcare technologies for anxiety (n=23), depression (n=18), or both anxiety and depression (n=5). Studies of technologies for anxiety evaluated the following: (1) acceptability (78%) reported high levels of satisfaction, (2) adoption (43%) commonly reported positive results, and (3) feasibility (43%) reported mixed results. Studies of technologies for depression evaluated the following: (1) appropriateness (56%) reported moderate helpfulness and (2) acceptability (50%) described a mix of both positive and negative findings. Studies of technologies designed to aid anxiety and depression commonly reported mixed experiences with acceptability and adoption and positive findings for appropriateness of the technologies for treatment. Across all studies, cost, fidelity, and penetration and sustainability were the least measured implementation outcomes.
Conclusions
Acceptability of eMental healthcare technology is high among users and is the most commonly investigated implementation outcome. Perceptions of the appropriateness and adoption of eMental healthcare technology were varied. Implementation research that identifies, evaluates, and reports on costs, sustainability, and fidelity to clinical guidelines is crucial for making high-quality eMental healthcare available to children and adolescents.

AB  - To realize carbon neutrality, there is an urgent need to develop sustainable, green energy systems (especially solar energy systems) owing to the environmental friendliness of solar energy, given the substantial greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-based power sources. When it comes to the evolution of intelligent green energy systems, Internet of Things (IoT)-based green-smart photovoltaic (PV) systems have been brought into the spotlight owing to their cutting- edge sensing and data-processing technologies. This review is focused on three critical segments of IoT-based green-smart PV systems. First, the climatic parameters and sensing technologies for IoT-based PV systems under extreme weather conditions are presented. Second, the methods for processing data from smart sensors are discussed, in order to realize health monitoring of PV systems under extreme environmental conditions. Third, the smart materials applied to sensors and the insulation materials used in PV backsheets are susceptible to aging, and these materials and their aging phenomena are highlighted in this review. This review also offers new perspectives for optimizing the current international standards for green energy systems using big data from IoT-based smart sensors.
