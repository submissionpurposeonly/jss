AB  - We introduce a comprehensive guide to improve literature sampling in systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) in management and adjacent social science disciplines. Analyzing 404 SLRs and MAs from top-tier management-related journals and the 135 methodological studies on which they relied revealed significant opportunities to improve sampling quality. We found that inadequate guidance and an overreliance on unfounded “best practices” often leads to suboptimal search strategies and incomplete reporting. To improve literature sampling, we have developed a guide that details four sequenced and prioritized scoping, searching, screening, and reporting steps. The guide also includes recommendations for the most suitable literature databases to search with, suggested (AI-enabled) tool support, and two checks to validate the effectiveness of search strategies. We created this guide by adapting the state-of-the-art recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA—the widely acknowledged benchmarks in methodical and reporting guidance—and supplementing them with additional evidence-based methodological insights. By adopting the guide, authors can ensure their sampling is effective and meets the high standards of SLRs and MAs, thereby likely boosting the impact of their review. The guide is applicable to all review types that require comprehensive, transparent, and reproducible sampling, including bibliometric studies and integrative reviews.

AB  - Introduction
In the study region an off-line approach is currently taken to adaptive radiotherapy delivery with plans to implement on-line approaches imminently. This is a step-change in how radiotherapy is delivered and represents a shift in traditional professional roles and responsibilities. This research aimed to explore therapeutic radiographer educational needs at a regional level and strategise how the therapeutic radiographer workforce can be enabled to deliver on-line adaptive radiotherapy.
Methods
A mixed methods study was undertaken consisting of a quantitative on-line survey followed by qualitative interviews and a focus group. Survey invites were sent to all registered therapeutic radiographers in the region. All survey participants were invited to a focus group. There were 32 respondents to the survey and six focus group participants from all three radiotherapy centres in the region. There were four interview participants who were local service and education leads.
Results
16 of 32 survey participants were moderately familiar with the concept of adaptive radiotherapy but 22 participants felt not confident at all or slightly confident to adapt treatment plans. A key area for development was decision making and clinical judgment prior to plan adaptation. Upskilling radiographers were seen as essential and inter-disciplinary collaborations were key to this, particular with physicist, dosimetrist and clinical oncologists. Robust educational programmes were identified as a requirement at and pre and post registration level.
Conclusion and implications for practice
The academic underpinning of adaptive radiotherapy needs to be addressed to streamline the rapid uptake of advanced radiotherapy technologies. There was a consensus that a regional, inter-organisational approach to addressing radiographer educational needs is warranted to ensure efficiency and sustainability of clinical on-line adaptive radiotherapy implementation.

AB  - Families of individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities or differences (NDDs) often struggle to find reliable health information on the web. NDDs encompass various conditions affecting up to 14% of children in high-income countries, and most individuals present with complex phenotypes and related conditions. It is challenging for their families to develop literacy solely by searching information on the internet. While in-person coaching can enhance care, it is only available to a minority of those with NDDs. Chatbots, or computer programs that simulate conversation, have emerged in the commercial sector as useful tools for answering questions, but their use in health care remains limited. To address this challenge, the researchers developed a chatbot named CAMI (Coaching Assistant for Medical/Health Information) that can provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services relevant to families of individuals with NDDs. The chatbot was developed, in collaboration with individuals with lived experience, to provide information about trusted resources covering core knowledge and services that may be of interest. The developers used the Django framework (Django Software Foundation) for the development and used a knowledge graph to depict the key entities in NDDs and their relationships to allow the chatbot to suggest web resources that may be related to the user queries. To identify NDD domain–specific entities from user input, a combination of standard sources (the Unified Medical Language System) and other entities were used which were identified by health professionals as well as collaborators. Although most entities were identified in the text, some were not captured in the system and therefore went undetected. Nonetheless, the chatbot was able to provide resources addressing most user queries related to NDDs. The researchers found that enriching the vocabulary with synonyms and lay language terms for specific subdomains enhanced entity detection. By using a data set of numerous individuals with NDDs, the researchers developed a knowledge graph that established meaningful connections between entities, allowing the chatbot to present related symptoms, diagnoses, and resources. To the researchers’ knowledge, CAMI is the first chatbot to provide resources related to NDDs. Our work highlighted the importance of engaging end users to supplement standard generic ontologies to named entities for language recognition. It also demonstrates that complex medical and health-related information can be integrated using knowledge graphs and leveraging existing large datasets. This has multiple implications: generalizability to other health domains as well as reducing the need for experts and optimizing their input while keeping health care professionals in the loop. The researchers' work also shows how health and computer science domains need to collaborate to achieve the granularity needed to make chatbots truly useful and impactful.

AB  - Introduction
There is a growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance various aspects of clinical trials. The goal of this systematic review is to assess the impact of implementing AI approaches on different aspects of oncology clinical trials.
Methods
Pertinent keywords were used to find relevant articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, which described the clinical application of AI approaches. A quality evaluation utilizing a customized checklist specifically adapted was conducted. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024537153).
Results
Out of the identified 2833 studies, 72 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Clinical Trial Enrollment & Eligibility were among the most commonly studied clinical trial aspects with 30 papers. The prediction of outcomes was covered in 25 studies of which 15 addressed the prediction of patients' survival and 10 addressed the prediction of drug outcomes. The trial design was studied in 10 articles. Three studies addressed each of the personalized treatments and decision-making, while one addressed data management. The results demonstrate using AI in cancer clinical trials has the potential to increase clinical trial enrollment, predict clinical outcomes, improve trial design, enhance personalized treatments, and increase concordance in decision-making. Additionally, automating some areas and tasks, clinical trials were made more efficient, and human error was minimized. Nevertheless, concerns and restrictions related to the application of AI in clinical studies are also noted.
Conclusion
AI tools have the potential to revolutionize the design, enrollment rate, and outcome prediction of oncology clinical trials.

AB  - Fatigue remains a critical contributor to human error in Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems, posing significant risks to aviation safety. The mentally demanding nature of ATC tasks, particularly during transitions from automated to manual control, intensifies the challenges associated with fatigue. While existing fatigue detection methods are broadly categorized into behavioral, physiological, and subjective approaches, there is limited understanding on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized in this context. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 105 peer-reviewed studies, focusing on both technological and human-centric dimensions of fatigue management in ATC. The review explores key advancements in fatigue detection strategies, including the development of reliable data collection platforms, refined feature classification techniques, and the use of simulation-based assessments. It further highlights the potential of AI to enhance traditional human factors frameworks by enabling a more integrated approach that balances human adaptability with automated support. Ultimately, this review provides actionable insights for both academia and industry, offering a comprehensive foundation for evolving fatigue risk management practices in alignment with Industry 5.0′s emphasis on human-centric automation.

AB  - The systematic approach to raising pigs in a multi-site production system, in terms of where the pigs are housed and how long they are fed, is generally called pig flow. This complex process is most often approached in a segmented fashion, not looking at all barns at the same time in relation to each other. Linear programming, the basis of most nutritional formulation packages and logistics services, provides a mathematical means for characterizing pig flow that allows a producer to look at the entire flow of pigs in a system at the same time. We describe a teaching model that provides the foundation to characterize pig flow in a commercial production system. The teaching model is built in Microsoft Excel® and incorporates key components of production such as growth rate, mortality, stocking density, seasonality, packer grid pricing, and marketing. The results from this teaching model are sound and provide the foundation for a larger model that is needed for full implementation within a production system, proving this model behaves as expected. The generalizability of the model and its assumptions allows for the inclusion of more barns, a more precise measure of time, and the ability to change the assumptions utilized in this teaching scenario, which are needed for direct application in a production system.

AB  - ULKB Logic is an open-source framework written in Python for reasoning over knowledge graphs. It provides an interactive theorem prover-like environment equipped with a higher-order language similar to the one used by HOL Light. The main goal of ULKB Logic is to ease the construction of applications that combine state-of-the-art computational logic tools with the knowledge available in knowledge graphs, such as Wikidata. To this end, the framework provides APIs for fetching statements from SPARQL endpoints and operating over the constructed theories using automated theorem provers and SMT solvers (such as the E prover and Z3). In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ULKB Logic, present its interfaces for querying knowledge graphs and for calling external provers, and discuss a use case of commonsense reasoning in which ULKB Logic is used as the target logic for representing the semantics of English sentences.

AB  - Context:
Argumentation is a fundamental part of learning, communication and problem-solving not only in software engineering but all education. Teaching argumentation is a long-standing practice, and with the advance of digital learning, it, too, has been transitioning to an online format.
Objective:
As computer-supported argumentation learning progresses, other learning domains have much to learn from it on how to enable argumentation and reasoning in automated and scalable online learning solutions.
Methods:
To review the current state of the field, we conducted a systematic literature review on the last decade of academic research and design on computer-supported argumentation learning systems. We reviewed and summarised the central aspects and approaches of reported systems.
Results:
We reviewed 34 different argumentation learning tools. The review showed that approaches to computer-supported argumentation vary significantly in many aspects, e.g., argumentation theory, learning task types and collaboration status. However, the use of argumentation graphs is quite common. Most modern tools seem to embrace the role of feedback in learning.
Conclusions:
The role of individual learning has risen in computer-supported argumentation learning. This is in opposition to previous predictions and statements on the role of collaborative learning of argumentation. Automated feedback has, on the other hand, become commonplace in collaborative and individual-use argumentation learning tools. The modern generation of argumentation teaching tools is Web-based but recently we have also seen the emergence of mobile-based solutions.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to determine how cellulose nanofiber (CNF) enhance the mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and functional versatility of dental materials, based on in vitro evidence. A systematic review protocol was developed according to PRISMA 2020. The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase for English-language publications with no date restrictions, yielding 180 publications. After removing duplicates, 150 remained, from which 23 were evaluated in full. 17 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 13 had a low risk of bias, 4 had a moderate risk, and none had a high risk. Across all included investigations, CNF consistently improved mechanical performance, particularly flexural and compressive strength, while maintaining or enhancing biocompatibility in various cell culture models. CNF’s nanofibrillar structure and modifiable surface chemistry also expanded its functional versatility, enabling applications such as drug encapsulation and targeted antimicrobial delivery. Overall, CNF emerges as a promising biomaterial for modern dentistry, offering superior mechanical reinforcement, favorable cell responses, and wide-ranging functional modifications. Further in vivo research and clinical trials are necessary to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy, thereby facilitating the translation of these in vitro findings into standard dental practice.

AB  - Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a central part of evidence-based research, which involves collecting and integrating empirical evidence on specific research questions. A key step in this process is building Boolean search queries, which are at the core of information retrieval systems that support literature search. This involves turning general research aims into specific search terms that can be combined into complex Boolean expressions. Researchers must build and refine search queries to ensure they have sufficient coverage and properly represent the literature. In this paper, we propose an adaptive query generation and refinement pipeline for SLR search that uses reinforcement learning to learn the optimal modifications to a query based on feedback from researchers about its performance. Empirical evaluations with 10 SLR datasets showed our approach achieves comparable performance to queries manually composed by SLR authors. We also investigate the impact of design decisions on the performance of the query generation and refinement pipeline. Specifically, we study the effects of the type of input seed, the use of general versus domain-specific word embedding models, the sampling strategy for relevance feedback, and number of iterations in the refinement process. Our results provide insights into the effects of these choices on the pipeline’s performance.

AB  - Objectives
To record the terms, definitions, and abbreviations used in the literature, investigate the rationale for employing dynamic compliance (Cdyn) in studies of anaesthetised dogs with mechanically ventilated lungs, and identify the methods used to calculate Cdyn.
Databases used
A comprehensive search across Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and CAB Abstracts databases identified studies using keywords related to canine species, anaesthesia, Cdyn, and the respiratory system. Reference lists from recent publications (2010–2024) focusing on respiratory mechanics in dogs were also reviewed. Following duplicate removal, a two-step screening process was employed. This involved reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by full-text retrieval based on predefined eligibility criteria, concentrating on studies involving anaesthetised dogs with closed chests where Cdyn was measured. Data extraction included terms, definitions, measurement equipment, and study applications.
Conclusions
Of 362 initial documents, 186 duplicates were removed, leaving 176 for abstract screening. Of these, 122 full texts were retrieved, with 54 meeting inclusion criteria. Most studies were published between 1970 and 2002, with only five published after 2010. In 49/54 studies, dogs were used as animal models for translational research. Whole-body plethysmographs and pneumotachographs were commonly used to evaluate tidal volume for the calculation of Cdyn; the sampling site of airway pressure varied. In 43/54 papers, oesophageal or pleural pressure was measured to determine transpulmonary pressure, suggesting that Cdyn of the lung was monitored, although this was not always explicitly stated. The three most recent studies involved clinical patients, using Cdyn of the respiratory system displayed by respiratory modules integrated into ventilators or multiparametric physiological monitors. Future research should establish clear protocols for measuring Cdyn to enhance understanding and characterization for both research and clinical purposes.

This study addresses the need for a comprehensive analysis of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) in the context of open-source disaster intelligence, a topic where existing literature remains fragmented. Employing a systematic approach, a query scheme incorporating 11 at. keywords was devised, resulting in the acquisition of 53 relevant studies. These studies were meticulously reviewed and synthesized to propose six dimensions of GPT-based open-source disaster intelligence, yielding critical insights into disaster management strategies. Within these 6 dimensions, 24 studies were categorized under “Social Media Analytics for Disaster Response” dimension, 7 on “Disaster Prediction,” 11 on “Disaster Management,” 5 on “Disaster Support Via Technology”, 3 on “Climate Change and Disaster Communication,” and 5 studies were classified under the “General Disaster Analysis” dimension. Leveraging advanced methodologies and machine learning driven tools such as PRISMA, Litmaps, and VOSviewer, this research not only identifies key trends and collaborative efforts but also provides valuable bibliographical insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. For example, the co-citation analysis demonstrated a total of 3703 authors, among whom 51 authors garnered a minimum of 10 citations, leading to the identification of 3 distinct clusters. By addressing a critical research gap and offering a methodologically robust examination, this study contributes significantly to the advancement of knowledge in GPT-based open-source disaster intelligence, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing disaster response strategies worldwide.

AB  - Summary
Comprehensive monolingual natural language processing (NLP) surveys are essential for assessing language-specific challenges, resource availability, and research gaps. However, existing surveys often lack standardized methodologies, leading to selection bias and fragmented coverage of NLP tasks and resources. This study introduces a generalizable framework for systematic monolingual NLP surveys. Our approach integrates a structured search protocol to minimize bias, an NLP task taxonomy for classification, and language resource taxonomies to identify potential benchmarks and highlight opportunities for improving resource availability. We apply this framework to Greek NLP (2012–2023), providing an in-depth analysis of its current state, task-specific progress, and resource gaps. The survey results are publicly available and are regularly updated to provide an evergreen resource. This systematic survey of Greek NLP serves as a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and its potential for broader application to other not-so-well-resourced languages as regards NLP.

After critically evaluating these influential but problematic models, I present a three-level neo-Tinbergenian approach to behavior that considers the triadic integration of behavioral causes, structure, and consequences along a single temporal continuum. I then argue that object-directed play is a good candidate behavior to apply this new paradigm by presenting significant examples of the combined analysis of at least two of these three levels. Finally, I show how stone handling, a form of culturally-transmitted object play in macaques, is perfectly amenable to this unified three-level explanatory framework. My proposed approach fits recent theoretical and empirical advances in behavioral biology, has a heuristic value, and may provide numerous benefits to a range of behavioral scientists.

AB  - In the current automotive industry, human operators perform wire harness assembly manually, which causes significant quality, productivity, safety, and ergonomic problems. Robotic assembly is a critical facilitator in addressing these problems. However, it remains challenging to implement for robotizing the assembly of wire harnesses. Wire harness assembly is a specific scenario of deformable linear object manipulation. Robotizing this assembly task demands robots to flexibly adapt their actions to the dynamically changing industrial environment based on robotic perception results. Existing research suggested the significance of robotic visual perception in the robotic assembly of wire harnesses. Implementing computer vision techniques is fundamental to enabling robots’ visual perception capabilities. Nonetheless, the industry has yet to introduce vision–based solutions to robotize wire harness assembly fully or partially. Through a systematic literature review, this article identifies fifteen scientific publications in vision–based robotized wire harness assembly. The results show various computer vision applications regarding wire harness components and assembly operations studied in previous research. Nevertheless, this article recognizes two significant challenges for computer vision applications in robotized wire harness assembly: (1) fulfilling production requirements on robustness and practicality and (2) exploiting the intrinsic physical features of wire harnesses for visual recognition. This article also advocated five prospective research directions toward more efficient and practical vision-based robotized wire harness assembly: (1) developing learning-based vision systems to exploit intrinsic features and multi–modality data of wire harnesses; (2) adapting vision systems proposed for robotizing assembly operations in manufacturing wire harnesses; (3) assessing the practicality, robustness, reliability, and sustainability of vision systems; (4) inquiring vision–based human–robot collaboration; and (5) exploring new product designs for facilitating visual recognition.

AB  - Soil degradation is a growing problem that threatens the well-being of humanity worldwide. One of the pillars of soil health are soil organisms, which are involved in a variety of soil processes and functions contributing to numerous ecosystem services. Although the Balkans are considered a hotspot of European biodiversity, our knowledge of soil life in this region is still limited. The Edaphobase data warehouse (https://portal.edaphobase.org/) focuses on European soil biodiversity data. The Balkan datasets in this database were analysed alongside relevant scientific literature to gain insight into soil biodiversity research and collaborative schemes in the region. In addition, assessments of national capacities for data provision and soil biodiversity research were obtained through an expert survey. The results of the study show large differences between the Balkan countries. Although Edaphobase enables metadata to accompany the soil biodiversity data, the potential of this comprehensive data warehouse for ecological modelling is largely underutilised by Balkan datasets. Responses to the questionnaire revealed significant gaps in national financial and technical capacities for soil biodiversity research, which could be addressed through an instrument that supports international collaboration via project funding. Such mechanisms would not only reduce economic disparities, but also promote cohesion within the scientific community of the region. The analysis of the network of Balkan authors revealed that collaboration between Balkan experts is currently quite unbalanced and that some countries are isolated in their research activities. This study provides a novel insight into the current state of soil biodiversity science in the Balkan countries and serves as an important reference point for a much-needed regional approach to promote soil biodiversity research in the Balkans.

AB  - Objective
This study aimed to synthesize the best available evidence and integrate clinical expertise to develop a structured, evidence-based leakage management system for cancer-preventive ileostomy care.
Methods
A two-phase mixed-methods design was employed. First, a systematic review was conducted following the PIPOST framework (Population: cancer-preventive ileostomy patients; Intervention: leakage management strategies; Professionals: ostomy caregivers; Outcomes: leakage incidence and skin complications; Setting: hospitals; Evidence types: clinical decisions, guidelines, evidence summaries, best practices, systematic reviews, and expert consensus). Databases and clinical repositories were searched from inception to June 2024, yielding 23 high-quality documents. Second, a Delphi consensus process involving 15 ostomy nursing experts across six Chinese provinces refined the evidence into actionable clinical protocols through two iterative consultation rounds. Consensus thresholds included a Likert score ≥ 4 and coefficient of variation < 0.25.
Results
The finalized leakage management system comprises three domains—prevention, assessment, and intervention—organized into 11 themes and 46 actionable items. Key components include preventive strategies for ileostomy leakage, dynamic ostomy appliance selection, and protocols for managing leakage-related skin damage. Expert consensus highlighted the importance of individualized care, with adjustments based on effluent characteristics and gas production. The Delphi panel achieved high agreement (Cr ​= ​0.89, Kendall's W ​= ​0.194–0.137, P ​< ​0.05).
Conclusions
This study presents a robust, evidence-based leakage management system tailored to the needs of cancer-preventive ileostomy survivors. By integrating high-quality evidence with practical clinical insights, the system offers valuable guidance for improving patient outcomes and enhancing the quality of ostomy nursing care in real-world settings.

AB  - Code Smell Detection (CSD) plays a crucial role in improving software quality and maintainability. And Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as a promising approach for CSD due to their superior performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based CSD methods heavily relies on the quality of the training data. Despite its importance, little attention has been paid to analyzing the data preparation process. This systematic literature review analyzes the data preparation techniques used in DL-based CSD methods. We identify 36 relevant papers published by December 2023 and provide a thorough analysis of the critical considerations in constructing CSD datasets, including data requirements, collection, labeling, and cleaning. We also summarize seven primary challenges and corresponding solutions in the literature. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for preparing and accessing high-quality CSD data, emphasizing the importance of data diversity, standardization, and accessibility. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to harness the full potential of DL techniques in CSD.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is now an integral part of our daily life and society. AI offers numerous affordances with potential positive and negative impact on society. K-12 educators are responsible to prepare the future generations to harness the benefits of AI ethically, responsibly, safely, and critically. Teachers need sound knowledge, skills, and dispositions to implement ethics-driven AI literacy education. To achieve this goal, there is need to identify and operationalize the competencies that teachers need to foster AI literacy. We conducted a larger systematic literature review (SLR), which reviewed empirical studies focused on AI literacy published in the last ten years (2014-2024) to explore and consolidate all competencies for K-12 teachers. This paper reports on teachers’ ethical competencies identified from this SLR. The review of 76 papers included in the final dataset unveils that the ethical AI competencies are interdependent and co-occur in a given context such that teachers may need a combination of knowledge, skills, and dispositions to successfully implement AI literacy education. The findings revealed that teachers need (1) the knowledge competencies of AI ethics issues, limitations of AI, socio-political awareness, and human in the loop, (2) skills of AI transparency and explainability, critical analysis of AI, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy, and (3) the dispositions of AI ethics sensitivity, critical attitude towards AI, and being inclusive and culturally responsive. These ethical competencies can inform teacher preparation and professional development programs for teachers to leverage AI technologies ethically in education.

AB  - This article explores the phenomenon of the decentralisation defence, which refers to instances where ‘decentralisation’ is invoked either as a shield against liability or as insulation from the reach of the law. This defence is rooted in the technological features of distributed ledger technology and smart contracts built on the blockchain settlement layer, including pseudonymity, programmability, immutability and decentralisation. Together, these features enable transactions while reducing reliance on centralised intermediaries. Although major decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, such as decentralised crypto exchanges, are not harmful per se, their misuse by bad actors creates risks for market participants. The recent cases of Uniswap Labs and Tornado Cash illustrate that the decentralisation defence can result in unaddressed harms and produce other negative externalities. These outcomes have prompted efforts to identify regulatory hooks along the centralisation vectors. The search for a responsible party in blockchain-enabled decentralised arrangements resembles processes observed with two other key technological advancements in the digital space – the internet and artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the modern EU regulation of these transformative technologies, this article focuses on the role of user interfaces as DeFi gatekeepers, and software developers engaged in the creation of smart contract code and blockchain protocols.

AB  - Deception detection is a crucial concern in our daily lives, with its effect on social interactions. The human face is a rich source of data that offers trustworthy markers of deception. The deception detection systems are non-intrusive, cost-effective, and mobile by identifying face expressions. Over the last decade, numerous studies have been conducted on deception/lie detection using several advanced techniques. Researchers have given their attention to inventing more effective and efficient solutions for deception detection. However, there are still a lot of opportunities for innovative deception detection methods. Thus, in this literature review, we conduct the statistical analysis by following the PRISMA protocol and extract various articles from five e-databases. The main objectives of this paper are (i) to explain the overview of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for deception detection, (ii) to outline the existing literature, and (iii) to address the current challenges and its research prospects for further study. While significant issues in deception detection methods are acknowledged, the review highlights key conclusions and offers a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art techniques, emphasizing contributions and opportunities. The findings illuminate current trends and future research prospects, fostering ongoing development in the field.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been rapidly transforming the landscape of natural sciences and has the potential to revolutionize the process of data analysis and hypothesis formulation as well as expand scientific knowledge. ML has been particularly instrumental in the advancement of cheminformatics and materials science, including membrane technology. In this review, we analyze the current state-of-the-art membrane-related ML applications from ML and membrane perspectives. We first discuss the ML foundations of different algorithms and design choices. Then, traditional and deep learning methods, including application examples from the membrane literature, are reported. We also discuss the importance of learning data and both molecular and membrane-system featurization. Moreover, we follow up on the discussion with examples of ML applications in membrane science and technology. We detail the literature using data-driven methods from property prediction to membrane fabrication. Various fields are also discussed, such as reverse osmosis, gas separation, and nanofiltration. We also differentiate between downstream predictive tasks and generative membrane design. Additionally, we formulate best practices and the minimum requirements for reporting reproducible ML studies in the field of membranes. This is the first systematic and comprehensive review of ML in membrane science.

AB  - Maritime cybersecurity has emerged as a critical and rapidly evolving research field, necessitated by the increasing reliance on digital technologies and interconnectivity within the global maritime industry. In this paper, we adopt a bibliometric analysis method to review the existing academic publications pertaining to maritime cybersecurity, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the development status and research focus. The results show that: 1) Research on maritime cybersecurity is currently undergoing significant development; 2) Most articles on marine cybersecurity are published by researchers from North America and Europe, with most of them stem from the US, Norway, and UK; 3) Most international collaborations are limited at a regional level, and the major regions include North America and Europe; 4) Five closely related research keyword communities show that maritime cybersecurity research hotspots focus on transport-related cyber-attacks, autonomous vessel, AIS, maritime communication, and UAV. The above thorough examination of the current research on maritime cybersecurity also shows that there are some weaknesses in existing studies. For example, the research topic of maritime cybersecurity has not yet received adequate attention and the research hotspot is relatively concentrated. Based on the findings, we propose perspectives of the research on maritime cybersecurity from the aspects of the effectiveness of regulations, funding and investment opportunities, digitalization in the maritime industry and cybersecurity, advances in maritime communication systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles and maritime cybersecurity.

AB  - The transportation of hazardous materials (Hazmat) has been essential to supply chains but has posed significant safety risks, resulting in severe human, environmental, and financial impacts. This study systematically reviewed 1,779 publications from 1970 to 2022, focusing on trends, challenges, and research gaps in Hazmat transportation safety. Through bibliometric and systematic review methodologies, key areas of investigation, such as risk management, safety routing, and emergency response, were identified. A strong international collaborative network was revealed, with significant emphasis on managing risks. However, critical topics such as human factors, resilience engineering, and security were found to be underexplored. Despite advancements in risk assessment, important gaps remained in addressing dynamic risks and improving model validation using real-world data. Furthermore, it was concluded that future research should address these gaps while enhancing existing methodologies. This review provided a comprehensive analysis of the current research landscape, highlighting areas requiring further exploration and offering valuable insights into improving the safety and sustainability of Hazmat transportation systems. The findings are expected to guide future research efforts and inform policy development, ultimately contributing to the reduction of risks associated with Hazmat transport and advancing safer practices in this essential sector.

AB  - At the heart of affective computing lies the crucial task of decoding human emotions, a field that expertly intertwines emotion identification with the nuances of sentiment analysis. This dynamic discipline harnesses an array of data sources, from the intricacies of textual information to the subtleties of auditory signals and the dynamic realm of visual cues. One of its primary challenges is discerning emotions from physical cues like facial expressions and vocal tones, especially when these emotions are subtly concealed. The precise information yielded by physiological signals is invaluable, yet the complexity of their acquisition in real-world settings remains a formidable challenge. Our comprehensive systematic review marks a significant foray into trimodal affective computing, integrating text, audio, and visual data to provide a holistic understanding. We analyzed over 410 research articles from prominent conferences and journals spanning the last two decades. This extensive study categorizes and critically evaluates a spectrum of affect recognition methods, from unimodal to multimodal approaches, including bimodal and trimodal, offering profound insights into their structural composition and practical effectiveness. In concluding our exploration, we highlight the pivotal aspects of affective computing and chart a course for future groundbreaking research. This includes refining data integration techniques, overcoming challenges in emotion recognition, and addressing the critical ethical dimensions inherent in this field.

AB  - Over the last century, district heating (DH) has only achieved global market shares of around 10 %. To reach its potential market shares of 25–50 % in Europe by 2050, growth must drastically accelerate. But deployment of DH is hindered by barriers, potentially slowing this fast-paced transition of the heat system. In this paper, we identify barriers to the deployment of DH through manual and GPT-aided literature reviews. These reviews are complemented by a survey of 94 DH experts from Europe and North America, regions which account for approximately 20 % of global- and 93 % of European DH supply. We find that economic and political barriers are considered both most significant and most difficult to overcome. The importance of individual barriers varies between countries based on the existing shares of DH and renewable heat in DH supply respectively. The most important individual barriers include high installation costs, regulatory uncertainty and insufficient policies to integrate DH with other energy sectors. If a faster pace of system-integrated DH deployment is desired, it is critical to reduce the underlying investment risk of district heating projects through an expansion of integrated energy system planning, and regulations such as zoning and mandates.

AB  - The competitive push for business schools to publish in prestigious journals has resulted in a disproportionate number of papers in prestigious Management and Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) journals coming from a select group of institutions. Our analysis shows the Matthew effect of prestigious journals favors established schools with 51.2 % of papers in 18 Management ABS 4* journals and 61.3 % of papers in 3 OR/MS ABS 4* journals involving authors from the 100 top business schools identified by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). Citation patterns are similarly concentrated among papers authored by scholars from UTD-listed business schools, with nearly 80 % of citations from 4* Management journals directed to equally rated 4* Management journals (67.8 % for 4* OR/MS journals). An initial regression analysis suggested a positive correlation between the percentage of papers in a journal attributed to authors affiliated with those leading business schools and journal citation performance. However, further examination using multi-level regression adjusted for journal prestige, using the ABS and FT50 lists, showed a negative interaction effect on citation rates for papers from these schools in prestigious OR/MS journals. This insightful finding was confirmed by a post-hoc comparison revealing no significant citation advantage in prestigious journals for papers from leading business schools over those from a broader range of institutions. Thus, while leading business schools benefit from disproportionate space in prestigious journals, this does not translate to a citation advantage for the journals themselves, indicating no Matthew effect at the journal level driven by these schools. We argue that our findings show a unique opportunity for prestigious journals and business schools to expand collaborations with institutions in geographies historically underrepresented without a significant impact on the citation performance of those journals. This inclusion would only benefit research excellence, as our results demonstrate convergence in citation rates, citation patterns on external research areas, and topics across both subsets of papers—from leading institutions and those from a broader institutional spectrum—published in prestigious journals, indicating that diversifying contributions does not compromise the performance of these journals.

AB  - Background and aim
Performing sacral massage during the childbirth process can provide numerous benefits due to its potential to alleviate stress and exhaustion. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of sacral massage in pregnant women during labor.
Method
A comprehensive search was conducted in main databases from inception to 18th May 2024. The quality of included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies was assessed using the Jadad Scale and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS), respectively. All analyses were performed using the RevMan version 5.3. The GRADEpro GDT tool was utilized to determine the level of certainty of the evidence.
Findings
Nine articles were included in the systematic review and eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The findings showed that in the sacral massage group, the labor pain intensity was significantly decreased (SMD= -2.40, 95 % CI -3. 5 to -1.29, p < 0.0001, I² = 97 %). The findings also showed that sacral massage does not significantly alter the length of the first labor stage (MD=-0.04, 95 % CI -0.27 to 0.20, p = 0.77, I² = 0 %) and the total duration of labor (MD= -0.56, 95 % CI -1.66, 0.55, p = 0.32, I² = 90 %). The certainty of evidence for labor pain was moderate and for duration of the first stage and total duration of labor were very low.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that sacral massage was an effective, non-pharmacologic method that significantly alleviating pain in women during childbirth. As a result, this intervention can be implemented in clinical settings during labor.

AB  - With the rise of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), the construction industry (CI) is undergoing a transition from traditional linear supply chains to Circular Supply Chain Management 5.0 (CSCM 5.0). However, this transformation encounters several challenges, highlighting the need to identify a taxonomy of Critical Barrier Factors (CBFs) to foster the intelligent and sustainable development of the construction sector. This study employs a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the Critical Barrier Factors and their taxonomy (political, economic, environmental, social, technological, and organizational) for CSCM5.0 transformation. The Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is applied to eliminate bias in the CBFs and taxonomy, while the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used to assess the importance of the six taxonomies, revealing that governmental policy support plays a dominant role in CSCM 5.0 transformation. Furthermore, the study employs Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to construct the hierarchical structure of the CBFs and integrates MICMAC analysis to explore the interrelationships among these factors. The findings indicate that an inadequate regulatory framework, the absence of policies and regulations, and insufficient economic incentives are the core CBFs to CSCM 5.0 transition, which indirectly validates the accuracy of the FAHP results. This study provides policy recommendations and practical guidance for governments, enterprises, and relevant stakeholders to promote a low-carbon, intelligent, and circular economic model in the CI.

AB  - Spacecraft and their onboard equipment are subjected to significant dynamic loads, particularly when the activation of pyrotechnic devices induces intense high-frequency shocks, known as pyroshocks, which propagate throughout the entire structure and can cause critical damages. Qualification tests are needed to ensure aerospace equipment can withstand impulsive loads and therefore test rigs and simulation models are designed to replicate real-world pyroshocks while pursuing repeatability, accuracy, and safety. This paper systematically categorizes and analyzes existing research papers on pyroshock simulation techniques, examining both experimental and numerical approaches. Scientific databases were queried but only a selection of the most relevant papers is presented and labeled, according the publication year, the purpose, the physical domain, the numerical method, the kind of fixture, and the excitation method. Additionally, a shorter review on contact mechanics is included to offer complementary insights, considering its relevance to pyroshock simulations.

AB  - We explore the determinants of voluntary disclosures about climate risks made by managers during earnings conference calls, and examine whether these disclosures provide decision-useful information to investors. Using a sample of more than 70,000 conference-call transcripts from 2005-2020 with over 6,000 disclosures related to climate risk events, we find that disclosure is more common for smaller firms with higher but more volatile performance. We also show that firms often bundle climate risk disclosures with bad news about earnings in conference calls that are longer and have a more negative tone. Controlling for earnings news and firm fixed effects, we find a negative stock price reaction to climate risk disclosures in conference calls, but we also find that these disclosures are positively associated with abnormal trading volume, suggesting investors have different beliefs about how to incorporate them. Finally, we find that the negative stock price reaction to bad news about earnings is less pronounced when managers provide climate risk disclosures. Overall, our results provide evidence on when managers make climate risk disclosures in conference calls and how investors react, and are consistent with regulators' proposals for more specific guidance on the form and content of such disclosures.

AB  - Solar interfacial evaporation is a potential and sustainable desalination technology. The structural design of photothermal materials plays an important role in improving the evaporation performance. Here, we propose a new evaporating structure consisting of liquid marble with tunable nanowire array to enhance solar evaporation. Such magnetically responsive nanowire arrays are enabled by controllable assembly of nanoparticles over the surface of liquid marble. Different from the traditional structure, the nanowire array increases light absorption through multiple reflection and to promote steam generation. Besides, the narrow space and local aggregation of particles within the nanowire array hinder heat diffusion to enhance evaporation efficiency. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the concept. The liquid marble with upward nanowire array (ULM) shows outstanding performance with the highest evaporation rate of 8.7 μg/s. This rate is 1.21, 1.04 and 1.04 times larger than that of liquid marble with nanoparticles (LM), left-tilt nanowire array (LLM) and right-tilt nanowire array (RLM). Numerical analysis further illustrates that the nanowire array concentrates the electromagnetic field and heat over the evaporative interface. The induced thermal-boundary layer with high-temperature thus improves the evaporation. This work provides a new concept of solar interfacial evaporation with tunable nanowire array, which has far-reaching implications in seawater desalination or wastewater treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Statement of problem
Fiber posts have been frequently used to restore endodontically treated teeth because of their favorable esthetic and mechanical properties. However, their removal, especially when fractured or debonded, poses a considerable clinical challenge. Conventional techniques for fiber post removal can be time consuming, risk excessive dentin loss, and lead to unpredictable deviations from the original canal path. With the emergence of guided technologies, their potential advantages over non-guided methods in terms of accuracy, dentin preservation, and efficiency require clarification.
Purpose
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate whether guided techniques improve the accuracy of fiber post removal from endodontically treated teeth compared with non-guided approaches by focusing on time spent, dentin loss, and deviation.
Materials and methods
A systematic search limited to publications up to October 2024 was conducted in 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Scopus Secondary, Embase, and Web of Science). Specific keywords included variations of “fiber post” and “guided.” After removing duplicates and applying inclusion criteria (studies testing guided fiber post removal with reported time, dentin loss, and/or deviation), 6 experimental studies remained for quantitative synthesis. Two independent reviewers evaluated eligibility, and a third resolved disagreements. Data extracted included sample sizes (ranging from 8 to 60 teeth per study), operator experience, measurement methods (digital imaging, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), 3-dimensionally (3D) printed guides, and microscopic assessment), and outcomes. To assess the risk of bias, the revised JBI critical appraisal tool was used. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, computing pooled means, standard mean differences (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I² statistic (α=.05).
Results
From the 5 included studies, guided techniques showed a pooled mean time spent of 3.47 minutes (95% CI, 1.70 to 5.25) and a deviation of 2.63 degrees (95% CI, 2.37 to 2.89). Dentin loss in the guided groups (3.83 mm³; 95% CI, −0.53 to 8.19) was statistically similar (P>.05). Comparisons between guided and non-guided groups revealed an SMD of −0.95 (95% CI, −3.19 to 1.29) for time and −2.06 (95% CI, −5.01 to 0.89) for dentin loss, with no significant differences noted (P>.05).
Conclusions
Guided fiber post removal techniques demonstrated statistically significant improvements in accuracy, specifically in angular and linear deviations. However, differences in dentin loss and procedure time between guided and non-guided approaches were not statistically significant. Additional standardized, large-scale studies are necessary to comprehensively evaluate the clinical benefits of guided techniques.

Evidence indicates that the quality of facility-based care may be a major factor contributing to this issue. This review aimed to identify, map, and synthesize all published studies on the quality of maternal and newborn care in Uganda. Following the Arksey and O’Malley five-stage framework for scoping reviews, a search strategy was employed to retrieve articles published over 20 years, from 2004 to 2024, in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers screened the extracted articles, first by title and abstract, and subsequently by full text, utilizing Covidence. Data were mapped according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Quality of Maternal and Newborn Care (QMNC) framework. Of the 2482 studies identified, 36 were included in this review. The majority of the studies focused on human resources and infrastructure, with few addressing the experience of care. Overall, the standards of care were inadequate across the studies, with particularly poor conditions noted in lower-tier government health facilities. Despite the critical importance of quality care in reducing maternal and newborn mortality, levels have remained persistently low in Uganda over the past 20 years, especially in public facilities. There is an urgent need to rethink the health system approach and deliberately enhance the quality of care if Uganda is to meet the 2030 global targets.

AB  - Data-driven cyberthreat detection has become a crucial defense technique in modern cybersecurity. Network defense, supported by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), has also increasingly adopted data-driven approaches, leading to greater reliance on data. Despite the importance of data, its scarcity has long been recognized as a major obstacle in NIDS research. In response, the community has published many new datasets recently. However, many of them remain largely unknown and unanalyzed, leaving researchers uncertain about their suitability for specific use cases. In this paper, we aim to address this knowledge gap by performing a systematic literature review (SLR) of 89 public datasets for NIDS research. Each dataset is comparatively analyzed across 13 key properties, and its potential applications are outlined. Beyond the review, we also discuss domain-specific challenges and common data limitations to facilitate a critical view on data quality. To aid in data selection, we conduct a dataset popularity analysis in contemporary state-of-the-art NIDS research. Furthermore, the paper presents best practices for dataset selection, generation, and usage. By providing a comprehensive overview of the domain and its data, this work aims to guide future research toward improving data quality and the robustness of NIDS solutions.

AB  - This study explores a comparative analysis of PLGA nanoparticles and liposomes as potential carriers for brain cancer drug delivery, with a special focus on how material informatics enhances their design, biocompatibility, and drug release profiles to improve treatment efficacy and contribute to sustainable health outcomes. The investigation employed a bibliometric analysis using Scopus and VOSviewer to uncover the role of material informatics in optimizing these nanocarriers. The analysis revealed that material informatics, particularly through the application of machine learning and molecular dynamics simulations, significantly optimizes the performance of both PLGA nanoparticles and liposomes. The results highlighted distinct strengths of each nanocarrier: PLGA nanoparticles excel in biodegradability, while liposomes offer superior drug encapsulation capabilities. However, material informatics techniques bridged these enhancing drug release kinetics, stability, and biocompatibility. These improvements are crucial for effective delivery across the blood-brain barrier, a major challenge in brain cancer treatment. The integration of computational modelling, machine learning, and high-throughput screening enabled by material informatics is shown to be a key factor in advancing the design and optimization of these nanocarriers. By leveraging these tools, researchers can develop more personalized and efficient drug delivery systems tailored to address the specific challenges of glioblastoma therapy, ultimately contributing to sustainable health outcomes

AB  - Agricultural robots show a growing potential to improve resource management and reduce the environmental impacts of farming. However, the evaluation of robots’ contribution to support sustainable farming is still lacking. This study specifically reviewed the operationalization of four agroecological principles at the field level: recycling, soil health, biodiversity and synergy. To this aim, a scoping review was conducted on the Scopus database, with a query within titles, abstracts, and author keywords mentioning robots, and agroecology or sustainability. The body of literature was screened to include only open field robots. The resulting 78 documents were coded inductively on three macro areas: (1) academic background, (2) robot operations, (3) contribution to agroecology principles, whether explicitly or implicitly mentioned. The results highlight that robots operationalize agroecology principles through non-chemical and selective weeding to preserve diversity and soil health, lighter designs that reduce soil compaction, and advanced data collection systems to optimize resource use and synergy. Solar-powered robots represent early steps toward recycling, but this principle remains understudied. The discussion expands on the potential of robotics in other innovative approaches for sustainable agriculture, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and novel farming system design. Key challenges include ensuring farmers are enabled to master data collection and management, as well as integrating high-tech robotics with low-tech solutions. These efforts are critical for leveraging agricultural robotics to advance agroecology and sustainability across diverse farming systems.

AB  - Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of hospital admission is an innovative tool that optimizes resource allocation and improves patient flow within emergency departments. Health institutions need to decongest these departments to maintain sustainability and become efficient. Increasing demand and excessive competition for limited resources directly contribute to these challenges.
Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence in the prediction of hospital admissions, evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, their impact on clinical decision- making, and their role in the optimization and allocation of resources.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published between 2019 and 2024 followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected based on a pre-defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, and methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (ChAMAI) tools.
Results
A total of 20 studies were included; most of the studies evaluated were retrospective. AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy (85 % to 95 %) compared to traditional methods, with Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks outperforming classical statistical models. Studies incorporating unstructured data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) have significantly improved patient flow and resource allocation. The integration of predictive analytics resulted in a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, optimized bed occupancy, and a decrease in emergency room overcrowding.
Conclusion
AI-driven admission prediction is promising in the hospital setting, as it improves efficiency and allows for proactive and rapid decision-making, optimizing available resources. Future research is promising and should focus on prospective studies to validate practical applicability.

AB  - Background
In recent years, there has been an upwelling of artificial intelligence (AI) studies in the health care literature. During this period, there has been an increasing number of proposed standards to evaluate the quality of health care AI studies.
Objective
This rapid umbrella review examines the use of AI quality standards in a sample of health care AI systematic review articles published over a 36-month period.
Methods
We used a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute umbrella review method. Our rapid approach was informed by the practical guide by Tricco and colleagues for conducting rapid reviews. Our search was focused on the MEDLINE database supplemented with Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were English-language systematic reviews regardless of review type, with mention of AI and health in the abstract, published during a 36-month period. For the synthesis, we summarized the AI quality standards used and issues noted in these reviews drawing on a set of published health care AI standards, harmonized the terms used, and offered guidance to improve the quality of future health care AI studies.
Results
We selected 33 review articles published between 2020 and 2022 in our synthesis. The reviews covered a wide range of objectives, topics, settings, designs, and results. Over 60 AI approaches across different domains were identified with varying levels of detail spanning different AI life cycle stages, making comparisons difficult. Health care AI quality standards were applied in only 39% (13/33) of the reviews and in 14% (25/178) of the original studies from the reviews examined, mostly to appraise their methodological or reporting quality. Only a handful mentioned the transparency, explainability, trustworthiness, ethics, and privacy aspects. A total of 23 AI quality standard–related issues were identified in the reviews. There was a recognized need to standardize the planning, conduct, and reporting of health care AI studies and address their broader societal, ethical, and regulatory implications.
Conclusions
Despite the growing number of AI standards to assess the quality of health care AI studies, they are seldom applied in practice. With increasing desire to adopt AI in different health topics, domains, and settings, practitioners and researchers must stay abreast of and adapt to the evolving landscape of health care AI quality standards and apply these standards to improve the quality of their AI studies.

AB  - Understanding animal emotional (affective) state is highly relevant to various disciplines (e.g., animal welfare, neuroscience, comparative psychology), and has been significantly advanced by translating affect-induced cognitive bias paradigms rooted in human psychology to non-human animal studies. Attention bias (i.e., preferential attention allocation, AB) tests are increasingly used as more practical substitutes to commonly used judgement bias tests. Yet, evidence that AB reflects affective valence in animals is still limited. We review in-depth the concept of attention and AB described in humans and discuss utilising human-derived AB paradigms for measuring animal affective states. We describe key concepts and functions of attention in humans, before concentrating on the relationship between AB to threat detection and human anxiety. We critically review animal AB studies, discuss methodological discrepancies in such studies, and highlight the need for further experimental refinements. This includes identifying appropriate species-specific test designs and stimuli, modes of presentation (e.g., real-life vs. artificial stimuli), and consideration of subject-related factors (e.g., personality, age). We conclude that experimental limitations currently hamper the validity of AB as a proxy of animal affect and hope that the knowledge gaps highlighted in our review will encourage further research.

KW  - Software defect prediction
KW  - Explainable AI
KW  - Machine learning
AB  - Context:
Software defect prediction is crucial for prioritising quality assurance tasks, however, there are still limitations to the use of defect models. For example, the outputs often do not provide the defect type, severity, or the cause of the defect. Current models are also often complex in implementation (they use low transparency classifiers such as random forest or support vector machines) and primarily output binary predictions. They lack directly actionable outputs, that is, outputs that provide additional information (e.g., defect severity or defect type) to aid in fixing the defect. One approach is to utilise tools of explainable AI.
Objective:
In order to improve current models and plan the direction for explainability in software defect prediction, we need to understand how explainable current models are.
Methods:
Starting from 861 papers from multiple databases, we investigated a sample of 132 papers in a systematic literature review. We extracted the following information to answer our research questions: (i) information about the outputs (e.g., how informative they were) and explainability methods used, (ii) how explainability and performance is measured and (iii) explainability in future research. Our results were summarised by manually labelling the data so that trends could be analysed across selected papers, along with a thematic analysis.
Results:
We found that 71% of current models used binary outputs, while 68% of models were not yet utilising any explainability techniques. Only 7% of studies considered explainability in their future research suggestions.
Conclusion:
There is still a lack of awareness among researchers for the need for explainability and motivation to invest further research into more explainable and more informative software defect prediction models.

AB  - Patent review is a time-consuming process because it involves the complexity of the documents with technical language and unpatterned files. Automating steps like data extraction can make technological prospects faster and more efficient. Thus, this study aimed to compare the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to automate the data extraction of patents. A traditional patent review was conducted in Espacenet and WIPO databases, using the test subject: AI tools for skin cancer detection. Two independent reviewers performed the patent screening in Excel traditionally, and the data extraction step was manually made both and using SciSpace. SciSpace was 13.2 times faster than the traditional way and correctly extracted 69.7 % of information. Although it is a promising tool to accelerate the patent review process, it is crucial to author review the final version to ensure its accuracy and the representation of its ideas.

AB  - We study the publication patterns of male and female finance scholars, contrasting them with their counterparts in the related fields of accounting, economics and general management by analysing a large sample of more than 400,000 journal outputs spanning over two decades. We show that, in particularly stark contrast to accounting and management publications, women are vastly under-represented as authors of finance ones. Further, our results demonstrate that work produced by female finance academics is published in lower-rated journals and garners fewer citations, a phenomenon we refer to as the ‘female finance penalty’. We find that the topics on which women in academic finance work and the methodological approaches they use are highly associated with this penalty. In particular, we show that female finance authors are more likely to engage in interdisciplinary and qualitative work, and to investigate topics that are linked with lower research success. Moreover, when it comes to journal placement, we find that female-authored work in finance is ‘penalised’ more for its interdisciplinarity than that authored by men. Finally, we show that female finance authors are less likely to be affiliated to US-based or highly ranked institutions – factors that typically increase both publication success and future citation – and when they are, there is some evidence that their citation rates are less likely to benefit from these affiliations than those of their male colleagues.

AB  - AI-based language tools such as ChatGPT have the potential to fundamentally change studying and teaching at universities. Since there have been few empirical studies on the use of AI systems by students, this article aims to analyze the use of AI in higher education. In particular, it focuses on identifying features that are important to students when using AI during their studies. For this purpose, a choice-based conjoint experiment was conducted through a survey involving over 6300 participants from German universities. The results show that students attach particular importance to the degree of scientific rigor. The optimal package for an AI-based tool for studying includes the citation of reliable or truthful sources, the detection and correction of errors in the input, a comprehensive and detailed formulation of the output, no AI-caused hallucinations and transparency of the database. These characteristics differ only slightly in group-specific analyses.

AB  - Optimisation and simulation models for the design and operation of grid-connected distributed energy systems (DES) often exclude the inherent nonlinearities related to power flow and generation and storage units, to maintain an accuracy-complexity balance. Such models may provide sub-optimal or even infeasible designs and dispatch schedules. In DES, optimal power flow (OPF) is often misrepresented and treated as a standalone problem. OPF consists of highly nonlinear and nonconvex constraints related to the underlying alternating current (AC) distribution network. This aspect of the optimisation problem has often been overlooked by researchers in the process systems and optimisation area. In this review we address the disparity between OPF and DES models, highlighting the importance of including elements of OPF in DES design and operational models to ensure that the design and operation of microgrids meet the requirements of the underlying electrical grid. By analysing foundational models for both DES and OPF, we identify detailed technical power flow constraints that have been typically represented using oversimplified linear approximations in DES models. We also identify a subset of models, labelled DES-OPF, which include these detailed constraints and use innovative optimisation approaches to solve them. Results of these studies suggest that achieving feasible solutions with high-fidelity models is more important than achieving globally optimal solutions using less-detailed DES models. Recommendations for future work include the need for more comparisons between high-fidelity models and models with linear approximations, and the use of simulation tools to validate high-fidelity DES-OPF models. The review is aimed at a multidisciplinary audience of researchers and stakeholders who are interested in modelling DES to support the development of more robust and accurate optimisation models for the future.

AB  - Classic cars hold substantial value in the automotive industry, and the restoration process plays a pivotal role in increasing their worth. Ensuring the certification of these restoration processes is vital, as is keeping owners well-informed about the ongoing procedures taking place in their appreciated vehicles. By monitoring and controlling these restoration activities, the management of classic car workshops can effectively optimize their operations, empower owners with pertinent information, and preserve the authentic nature of these vintage automobiles. This study aims to develop a digital twin system for a classic car bodywork restoration shop workshop. The latter integrates multiple sensor technologies, including location tracking, humidity and temperature sensing, accelerometer monitoring, and smart plugs, to facilitate the identification of ongoing activities of classic car bodywork restoration process instances. By leveraging these sensors, the digital twin system may simulate and control workshop operations more effectively. We perform a systematic rapid review of related work and, based on state-of-the-art practices, we identify existing architectures and software applications used for creating digital twin systems. Then, we propose the architecture for our digital twin system, detailing its functionalities. We aim at contributing to advancing digital twin technology in classic car bodywork restoration, enhancing its authenticity, and fostering improved management practices, and overall experience for classic car owners.

AB  - Efficiently verifying the customer’s identity is essential for ensuring the security of online transactions. Such verification is mainly accomplished according to the widespread Know Your Client (KYC) protocol, which relies on a self-identification handled by the user, typically providing personal data from their identification document (ID). In the current digital communication generation, such a task is usually performed by uploading a digital copy of the document by scanning or taking a real-time picture from a personal device such as a smartphone or tablet. Such activity, which usually involves manual data entry, is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Document Understanding (DU) has emerged as a crucial factor for automating data extraction in this scenario. One of its main challenges is the scarcity of data, which is barely available for security and privacy concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a solution that takes advantage of recent advances in DU to devise an innovative strategy for Identity Document Recognition (IDR), i.e., the task aimed at automatically understanding, extracting, and transcribing the fields of an ID card. We devised a two-stage approach based on fine-tuning a pre-trained model on synthetic and real-world data. We also developed a dedicated synthetic data generation tool to support the IDR process. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our methodology.

AB  - We examined how individual differences in epistemic beliefs, metacognition, and academic aptitude predicted successful navigation behaviors during internet-based digital reading. To do this, we first quantified internet navigation behaviors of 257 adolescents and used a random forest to identify which behaviors best explained variance in learning of an ill-structured topic. We found that search term generation, even controlling for sites accessed, was the dominant predictor of learning (i.e., knowledge gain and critical questioning). We argue these navigation behaviors reflect cognitive flexibility and task-centered navigation. Mediation analysis revealed that metacognitive awareness was a driving predictor behind students' successful implementation of these behaviors. Further, cognitive flexibility in navigation was particularly useful for students with less academic proficiency. We conclude that the metacognitive processes that lead adolescent readers to a website may be critical for success in unconstrained, internet-based environments.
Educational relevance statement
Digital reading is crucial for 21st century students to acquire, but it is unclear what specific skills or behaviors are most important to teach. In an analysis of high school students' digital reading, we found that the navigation behavior that best predicted learning and comprehension–even more than finding topic-specific sites–was creating topic-specific search queries that go beyond broad relevance to include a tight alignment to the topic. Students' engagement in this type of querying activity was predicted by individual differences in metacognition, suggesting that monitoring comprehension of the topic plays a role in the behavior. Individual differences in students' beliefs in the importance of digital literacy as a skill also predicted learning gains. These results suggest that educators may be able to improve digital reading by encouraging students to reflect on their search queries, specifically advising students to consider the scope of the context for learning and how the information they are looking up serves the purpose of the task. Finally, educators may be able to improve student performance in this domain by focusing not just on what is important for digital literacy, but also on why it is important and needs to be honed as its own skill.

AB  - Keyphrase prediction aims to generate phrases (keyphrases) that highly summarizes a given document. Recently, researchers have conducted in-depth studies on this task from various perspectives. In this paper, we comprehensively summarize representative studies from the perspectives of dominant models, datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work analyzes up to 167 previous works, achieving greater coverage of this task than previous surveys. Particularly, we focus highly on deep learning-based keyphrase prediction, which attracts increasing attention of this task in recent years. Afterwards, we conduct several groups of experiments to carefully compare representative models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to compare these models using the identical commonly-used datasets and evaluation metric, facilitating in-depth analyses of their disadvantages and advantages. Finally, we discuss the possible research directions of this task in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed how infodemics undermine public health efforts, which subsequently led to the promotion of harmful behaviors. This review aimed to examine major sources of misinformation and explore how demographic and socioeconomic factors affect digital and health literacy, shaping vulnerability to infodemics.
Methods
A narrative review was conducted to synthesize evidence on the pathways, sources, and social determinants of health misinformation. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis was performed using Scopus data from 1997 to 2024, analyzed via Bibliometrix and VOSviewer. The analysis focused on publications related to infodemics and health misinformation on digital platforms, mapping thematic clusters, trends, and keyword co-occurrences.
Results
Mainstream news media, social media, and scientific journals each play a role in disseminating misinformation, exacerbated by time pressure, algorithmic amplification, and inadequate validation processes. Factors attributable to low digital and health literacy include age, education, income, and internet access, which increase vulnerability to misinformation. The bibliometric analysis revealed exponential growth in related research, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight dominant research clusters were identified: Health communication and social media; Infodemiology and data analysis; COVID-19 and misinformation; Public and digital health; Vaccine hesitancy; Risk and infodemic management; Conspiracy theories in social media; and Crisis communication.
Conclusion
Infodemics are driven by multi-source digital misinformation and disproportionately affect those with limited literacy. Fact-checking as a mitigation effort can be developed by leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, yet strengthening digital and health literacy remains critical.

AB  - The concept of “code” connotes different meanings, intentions, and formalizations. From mathematics and computer sciences to psychology and culture, the term becomes less formal, more diverse, and sometimes appears ambiguous. In biology a growing number of codes ignite a debate about their role in evolution, biocomplexity, and agency, to name just a few. Here, a transdisciplinary group of code scientists attempts to capture the big picture of code research across their fields of interest. In this cross-sectional overview commonalities emerge that may pave the way towards a unified theory of life-based-on-codes. Codes underly cellular processes, perception, cognition, and communication. From ecosystems to human language, codes influence how individuals behave in groups, memorize, learn, and take part in cultural practices. Emotions like aggression, fear, anger, frustration, are important motivators of behaviour modulating mutual communication and sculpting individual experience. The inheritance of experience in form of innate release mechanisms, stereotyped behaviour, or archetypes may have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots that rely on codes and impact our conscious decision making. Unconsciously, even our dreams draw on codes. In the future, conflation of different coding systems, e.g., from synthetic biology and generative artificial intelligence, will merge biological codes with machine logic and computer language to promote next-level transhumanism. Codes emerge as a currency converter between systems of life and between different scientific disciplines.

AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have drastically simplified the creation of synthetic media. While concerns often focus on potential misinformation harms, ‘non-consensual intimate deepfakes’ (NCID) – a form of image-based sexual abuse – pose a current, severe, and growing threat, disproportionately impacting women and girls. This article examines the measures implemented with the recently adopted Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA) and argues that the new criminal offences and the ‘systems and processes’ approach the law adopts are insufficient to counter NCID in the UK. This is because the OSA relies on platform policies that often lack consistency regarding synthetic media and on platforms’ content removal mechanisms which offer limited redress to victim-survivors after the harm has already occurred. The article argues that stronger prevention mechanisms are necessary and proposes that the law should mandate all AI-powered deepfake creation tools to ban the generation of intimate synthetic content and require the implementation of comprehensive and enforceable content moderation systems.

This study conducted descriptive, reference spectroscopy, and scientific mapping analyses. To unearth the historical foundations of FSF detection research, the study employed the “Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS)” technique. The study chose publications from 1989 to 2022 and identified a slow initial publication pace from 1989, followed by a surge in 2003, aligned with global accounting fraud scandals. Through RPYS, it identified 24 seminal research works (from 1881 to 2022) across multiple disciplines (mathematics, psychology, criminology, sociology, economics, finance, accounting, auditing, data analytics and machine learning) that contributed to the development of the FSF detection research. The trend of FSF research shifted from “financial reporting” to “machine learning”, which underscores the necessity for researchers, organizations, and policymakers to integrate emerging technologies like machine learning and data analytics and promote interdisciplinary and international cooperation to enhance the detection of FSF.

AB  - ABSTRACT
With the development of industrialization, energy has been a critical topic for scientists and engineers over centuries. However, due to the complexity of energy chemistry in various areas, such as materials design and fabrication of devices, it is hard to obtain rules beyond empirical ones. To address this issue, machine learning has been introduced to refine the experimental and simulation data and to form more quantitative relationships. In this review, we introduce several typical scenarios of applying machine learning to energy chemistry, including organic photovoltaics (OPVs), perovskites, catalytic reactions and batteries. In each section, we discuss the most recent and state-of-art progress in descriptors and algorithms, and how these tools assist and benefit the design of materials and devices. Additionally, we provide a perspective on the future direction of research in this field, highlighting the potential of machine learning to accelerate the development of sustainable energy sources. Overall, this review article aims to provide an understanding of the current state of machine learning in energy chemistry and its potential to contribute to the development of clean and sustainable energy sources.

AB  - The urgency of tackling climate change is driving a global shift towards renewable sources of energy, with a growing contribution from alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. With the global push for the sustainable energy, the demand for effective catalysts for sustainable chemical production and energy storage has been rapidly increasing. Computational simulations have contributed to the rational design of catalysts by allowing profound analysis of catalyst properties. Machine learning potential (MLP) has emerged as a potential tool to bridge the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and computational efficiency, overcoming the computational cost limitations of quantum chemistry-based simulations. This review discusses the development and application of MLP in multiscale simulations of heterogeneous catalysis. It covers the basic concepts of computational catalysis, the construction of MLP focusing on efficient datasets, atomic structure representations, and the process of training and evaluating of ML models. Furthermore, the potential applications of MLP are discussed in addressing computational challenges within the field, as MLP has potential to overcome limitations in simulation time and length scale. Lastly, the prospects for MLP are presented, taking advantage of the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence architectures. It is expected that the integration of MLP will accelerate progress within the catalyst research community and will bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental approaches in catalytic research.

AB  - In mid-2021, Fiji recorded one of the highest rates of COVID-19-related deaths in the world, amidst a rapidly disintegrating health care system. This scoping review examines Fijian health system responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, exploring both the vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies that emerged during the crisis. Using a systematic search strategy to identify studies relating to how the Fijian health system responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what insights could be drawn about adaptive practices and resilience in this context, 71 papers were included. The findings demonstrate that while Fiji experienced significant workforce shortages, infrastructure constraints, and disruptions to routine healthcare, the pandemic response was also characterised by rapid policy adaptations, innovative use of some digital technologies, and strong community-led initiatives. However, challenges with public trust and culturally inclusive governance remain key areas for consideration. By applying a health system resilience framework that explores the tangible and intangible dimensions of health systems, this review offers insights relevant both for Fiji and the region. Strengthening local capacity, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and embedding Indigenous and other local knowledge in public health strategies are crucial steps toward building resilient Pacific health systems and preparing for future crises.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized disease prediction and detection, but challenges such as data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, and model generalizability hinder its full potential in healthcare. This review examines these challenges and evaluates the effectiveness of AI-IoMT techniques in predicting chronic and terminal diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancers. We analyze a range of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, CNN, LSTM), alongside advanced strategies like federated learning, transfer learning, and blockchain, to improve model robustness, data security, and interoperability. Findings highlight that transfer learning and ensemble methods enhance model adaptability across clinical settings, while blockchain and federated learning effectively address privacy and data standardization. Ultimately, the review emphasizes the importance of data harmonization, secure frameworks, and multi-disease models as critical research directions for scalable, comprehensive AI-IoMT solutions in healthcare.

AB  - Sentiment analysis has proven to be a valuable tool to gauge public opinion in different disciplines. It has been successfully employed in financial market prediction, health issues, customer analytics, commercial valuation assessment, brand marketing, politics, crime prediction, and emergency management. Many of the published studies have focused on sentiment analysis of Twitter messages, mainly because a large and diverse population expresses opinions about almost any topic daily on this platform. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the multifaceted reality of sentiment analysis in social networks. We not only review the existing methods for sentiment analysis in social networks from an academic perspective, but also explore new aspects such as temporal dynamics, causal relationships, and applications in industry. We also study domains where these techniques have been applied, and discuss the practical applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence methods. This paper emphasizes the importance of temporal characterization and causal effects in sentiment analysis in social networks, and explores their applications in different contexts such as stock market value, politics, and cyberbullying in educational centers. A strong interest from industry in this discipline can be inferred by the intense activity we observe in the field of intellectual protection, with more than 8,000 patents issued on the topic in only five years. This interest compares positively with the effort from academia, with more than 2,300 articles published in 15 years. But these papers are unevenly split across domains: there is a strong presence in marketing, politics, economics, and health, but less activity in other domains such as emergencies. Regarding the techniques employed, traditional techniques such as dictionaries, neural networks, or Support Vector Machines are widely represented. In contrast, we could still not find a comparable representation of advanced state-of-the-art techniques such as Transformers-based systems like BERT, T5, T0++, or GPT-2/3. This reality is consistent with the results found by the authors of this work, where computationally expensive tools such as GPT-3 are challenging to apply to achieve competitive results compared to those from simpler, lighter and more conventional techniques. These results, together with the interest shown by industry and academia, suggest that there is still ample room for research opportunities on domains, techniques and practical applications, and we expect to keep observing a sustained cadence in the number of published papers, patents and commercial tools made available.

AB  - Context:
Growth of the older adult population has led to an increasing interest in technology-supported aged care. However the area has some challenges such as lack of care givers and limitations in understanding the emotional, social, physical, and mental well-being needs of older adults. Furthermore, there is a gap in the understanding between younger developers and ageing people of their requirements from digital systems. Digital health can play an important role supporting older adults’ well-being, emotional requirements, and social needs.
Objective:
We carried out a systematic review of the literature on RE for older adult digital health software. This was necessary to show the representatives of the current stage of understanding the needs of older adults in aged care digital health.
Methods:
Using established guidelines we developed a protocol, followed by the systematic search of eight databases. This resulted in 69 primary studies of high relevance, which were subsequently subjected to data extraction, synthesis, and reporting.
Results:
This systematic literature review highlights key RE processes used in digital health software for older people. It explored the key features developed for many digital solutions, utilization of technology for older user well-being and care, and the evaluations of proposed solutions. The review also identified key limitations found in existing primary studies that inspire future research opportunities.
Conclusion:
Our results indicate that requirements gathering and understanding have a significant variation between different studies. The differences are in the quality, depth, and techniques adopted for requirement gathering and this reason for these differences is largely due to uneven adoption of RE methods.

AB  - With the continuous growth of the urban population, the world is confronting numerous challenges in the near future of cities, related to environmental, economic and social aspects (e.g., traffic congestion, air pollution, waste management, etc.). The smart cyber city concept is introduced as a solution to achieve sustainability, effective management of energy, and smart living. Designing such complex systems with such features is an equally complex challenge. The cyber physical system (CPS) and the Internet of thing (IoT) are keys to achieve the realization of current smart city. In this paper, a survey of smart city vision is given while highlighting the potential benefits of a smart cyber city. A bibliometric network with Vosviewer software was created in order to select the most significant papers. It reviews smart city's key requirements and smart city enabling technologies. It then highlights the potential role of CPS and IoT. Finally, an outline of future research areas is given.

AB  - Amidst an increasingly turbulent global environment, multinational enterprises (MNEs) face a wide range of socio-political risks (SPRs) that are complex and multifaceted, e.g. geopolitical conflicts, rising protectionism or anti-globalization sentiment. They must respond strategically to remain competitive. In this systematic literature review, we propose a novel way to analyse risks, along geographical and temporal dimensions. We synthesize findings from 111 empirical peer-reviewed articles to identify how and why MNEs adopt nonmarket strategies (NMS) in contexts where risks prevail. Our findings show MNEs combine adaptive, additive and transformative strategies to address ongoing risks, but focus on adaptive approaches when faced with abrupt challenges. The distinction applies across geographic dimensions, with a tendency for firms to adopt embedded-oriented NMS for within-country SPRs, and cross-border balancing-oriented NMS to respond to cross-country SPRs. We contribute to the literature by enhancing conceptualization of SPRs and offering a comprehensive understanding on the types and effectiveness of NMS used by firms to address political and social risks. Our review enhances theory by proposing an integrated conceptual framework and directions to guide future research.

AB  - The collection of occurrence data of foodborne pathogens in foods faces the hindrances of dispersion of information, lack of standardisation and harmonisation, and ultimately, high expenditure in time and resources. The Pathogens-in-Foods (PIF) database was conceived as a solution to centralise published data on prevalence and concentration of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and parasites occurring in foods, obtained through systematic review (SR), and categorised in harmonised data structures under controlled terminologies. The present article outlines how PIF was constructed to adhere to the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) principles for scientific data management; and proceeds with a description of the PIF concept, which entails two phases: the SR process and the population of PIF. The protocolled SR process is supported by a well-defined search strategy, inclusion criteria, and rules for internal validation assessment; whereas the population of PIF with new data relies in data extraction, validation and release. The article then introduces a novel data quality approach, named as the CCC approach (data consistency, conformity and completeness), which ensures proper interpretation of data, richness of data, and flawless transcription of data. After a brief explanation of the three PIF components – database, back-end and front-end – the article proceeds with the exposition of the data model, as well as the capabilities of the front-end, including data search, insertion and curation. The future of PIF lies in expanding its capabilities, addressing emerging challenges, and leveraging technological advancements to maintain its relevance and utility in the evolving landscape of food safety.

AB  - Background
Accurate scientific terminology is crucial in health sciences to avoid misinterpretations. The use of ‘artemisinin resistance’ to describe delayed parasite clearance may be inaccurately equated with full resistance, as is typically the case when ‘resistance’ is used with other pathogens, leading to potential confusion. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced ‘partial artemisinin resistance’ to more accurately reflect the delayed parasite clearance observed with artemisinin-based therapies.
Methods
We analyzed whether articles in PubMed accurately convey the concept of ‘partial artemisinin resistance’ using GPT-4 to generate related search terms. AntConc was employed for corpus analysis of retrieved articles to examine terminology in titles and abstracts. A manual review evaluated the use of the WHO concept of ‘partial artemisinin resistance’ in the full text of a subset of high-impact articles.
Results
Out of 4041 articles retrieved, only 7 % (n = 281) used ‘partial’ or ‘delayed’ in titles or abstracts. Even after 2018, when WHO introduced the term ‘partial artemisinin resistance’, only 10 % of articles included this. Manual analysis of 161 full-text articles revealed that 94 % did not use ‘partial artemisinin resistance’, and 59 % did not explain the concept of delayed parasite clearance.
Conclusion
The delayed introduction of the term ‘partial artemisinin resistance’ may have contributed to continued use of the scientifically questionable term ‘artemisinin resistance’. This term may be misunderstood as full resistance, as is common with antibiotic resistance. Accurate terminology is essential for clear scientific communication, and precise terms should be established and consistently used from the outset by scientists and clinicians.

AB  - Background
Telemedicine offers a multitude of potential advantages, such as enhanced health care accessibility, cost reduction, and improved patient outcomes. The significance of telemedicine has been underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic, as it plays a crucial role in maintaining uninterrupted care while minimizing the risk of viral exposure. However, the adoption and implementation of telemedicine have been relatively sluggish in certain areas. Assessing the level of interest in telemedicine can provide valuable insights into areas that require enhancement.
Objective
The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the level of public and research interest in telemedicine from 2017 to 2022 and also consider any potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Google Trends data were retrieved using the search topics “telemedicine” or “e-health” to assess public interest, geographic distribution, and trends through a joinpoint regression analysis. Bibliographic data from Scopus were used to chart publications referencing the terms “telemedicine” or “eHealth” (in the title, abstract, and keywords) in terms of scientific production, key countries, and prominent keywords, as well as collaboration and co-occurrence networks.
Results
Worldwide, telemedicine generated higher mean public interest (relative search volume=26.3%) compared to eHealth (relative search volume=17.6%). Interest in telemedicine remained stable until January 2020, experienced a sudden surge (monthly percent change=95.7%) peaking in April 2020, followed by a decline (monthly percent change=–22.7%) until August 2020, and then returned to stability. A similar trend was noted in the public interest regarding eHealth. Chile, Australia, Canada, and the United States had the greatest public interest in telemedicine. In these countries, moderate to strong correlations were evident between Google Trends and COVID-19 data (ie, new cases, new deaths, and hospitalized patients). Examining 19,539 original medical articles in the Scopus database unveiled a substantial rise in telemedicine-related publications, showing a total increase of 201.5% from 2017 to 2022 and an average annual growth rate of 24.7%. The most significant surge occurred between 2019 and 2020. Notably, the majority of the publications originated from a single country, with 20.8% involving international coauthorships. As the most productive country, the United States led a cluster that included Canada and Australia as well. European, Asian, and Latin American countries made up the remaining 3 clusters. The co-occurrence network categorized prevalent keywords into 2 clusters, the first cluster primarily focused on applying eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), or digital health to noncommunicable or chronic diseases; the second cluster was centered around the application of telemedicine and telehealth within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
Our analysis of search and bibliographic data over time and across regions allows us to gauge the interest in this topic, offer evidence regarding potential applications, and pinpoint areas for additional research and awareness-raising initiatives.

AB  - Background:
Data sharing in healthcare is vital for advancing research and personalized medicine. However, the process is hindered by privacy, ethical, and legal challenges associated with patient data. Synthetic data generation emerges as a promising solution, replicating statistical properties of real data while enhancing privacy protection.
Methods:
This systematic review examines deep learning techniques for synthetic data generation in healthcare, focusing on their ability to maintain data utility and enhance privacy. Studies from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEE databases published between 2019 and 2023 were analyzed. Key methods explored include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models. Evaluation metrics encompass data resemblance, utility, and privacy preservation, with special attention to privacy-enhancing methods like differential privacy and federated learning.
Results:
GANs and VAEs demonstrated robust capabilities in generating realistic synthetic data for tabular, signal, image, and multi-modal datasets. Privacy-preserving approaches such as differential privacy and adversarial training significantly reduced re-identification risks while maintaining data fidelity. However, challenges persist in preserving temporal correlations, reducing biases, and aligning with regulatory frameworks, particularly for longitudinal and high-dimensional data.
Conclusion:
Synthetic data generation holds significant potential for privacy-preserving data sharing in healthcare. Ongoing research is required to develop advanced algorithms and evaluation frameworks, ensuring synthetic data’s quality and privacy. Collaboration between technologists and policymakers is essential to create comprehensive guidelines, fostering secure and effective data sharing in healthcare.

KW  - Research impact
AB  - Achieving impact from academic research is a challenging, complex, multifaceted, and interconnected topic with a number of competing priorities and key performance indicators driving the extent and reach of meaningful and measurable benefits from research. Academic researchers are incentivised to publish their research in high-ranking journals and academic conferences but also to demonstrate the impact of their outputs through metrics such as citation counts, altmetrics, policy and practice impacts, and demonstrable institutional decision-making influence. However, academic research has been criticized for: its theoretical emphasis, high degree of complexity, jargon-heavy language, disconnect from industry and societal needs, overly complex and lengthy publishing timeframe, and misalignment between academic and industry objectives. Initiatives such as collaborative research projects and technology transfer offices have attempted to deliver meaningful impact, but significant barriers remain in the identification and evaluation of tangible impact from academic research. This editorial focusses on these aspects to deliver a multi-expert perspective on impact by developing an agenda to deliver more meaningful and demonstrable change to how “impact” can be conceptualized and measured to better align with the aims of academia, industry, and wider society. We present the 4D model - Design, Deliver, Disseminate, and Demonstrate - to provide a structured approach for academia to better align research endeavors with practice and deliver meaningful, tangible benefits to stakeholders.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) prevalence has been steeply increasing over the last years. Environmental pollution, including certain pesticides, is considered a significant contributor to this rise. Certain genetic factors may pose an individual or subpopulation at increased risk to develop pesticide-induced PD. To support New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)-based hazard and risk assessment while considering known sources of interindividual variability, the aim of the current work was to identify biological factors related to increased susceptibility towards pesticide-induced PD onset and progression. To this end, a semi-systematic literature search was performed using Sysrev. We identified 61 relevant records. Potential gene-environment interactions were identified for several genes related to toxicokinetics, mitochondrial functioning, neurotransmission and proteostasis. These genes, except those related to toxicokinetics, have been described in Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) leading to parkinsonian motor symptoms. Untargeted (epi)genetic analyses identified potential new targets. NAMs offer the opportunity to include human-relevant genetic interindividual variability in toxicological hazard and risk assessment. For example, an additional test condition with mutations of interest for each Key Event (KE) could be included in a test strategy. Whole-organism models combined with CrispR-CAS techniques are suitable to study the effects of specific mutations on PD risk. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are promising to study interindividual variability in disease susceptibility based on material from genetically diverse donors. Since additional experiments are resource-intensive, further research is required to establish the need and way to include genetic susceptibilities in a regulatory context.

AB  - Transformation of municipal solid waste into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) offers a promising solution for waste-to-energy conversion. In this context, a systematic literature review and scientometric analysis is conducted showing refinements in RDF application for energy-from-waste (EfW) initiatives, forging a comprehensive approach to sustainable waste management. Key aspects of EfW projects using RDF are examined, focusing on methodologies for calorific value estimation, waste characterization, quality assessment, and public–private partnerships (PPPs). Emphasis is placed on the necessity of accurate energy potential measurement and advanced characterization techniques, including computer vision, for effective waste sorting and analysis. Quality assessments of RDF are highlighted for their impact on decisions within the biomass fuel supply chain, emphasizing the importance of optimizing energy recovery. PPP’s are identified as key to successful execution of EfW projects, with their roles, trends, and risk modeling crucial for fostering effective collaboration between public and private sectors. The study concludes by identifying research gaps, such as the deficiency of new frameworks to support technical assessments of waste processing facilities for strategic, tactical, and operational improvements. Additionally, RDF applications in EfW are limited because of inconsistent waste sorting, deviation from specifications and environmental regulations. This approach aims to enhance sustainable waste management and energy recovery, guiding future research and implementation in the field.

AB  - Background
In recent epochs, the field of critical medicine has experienced significant advancements due to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, AI robots have evolved from theoretical concepts to being actively implemented in clinical trials and applications. The intensive care unit (ICU), known for its reliance on a vast amount of medical information, presents a promising avenue for the deployment of robotic AI, anticipated to bring substantial improvements to patient care.
Objective
This review aims to comprehensively summarize the current state of AI robots in the field of critical care by searching for previous studies, developments, and applications of AI robots related to ICU wards. In addition, it seeks to address the ethical challenges arising from their use, including concerns related to safety, patient privacy, responsibility delineation, and cost-benefit analysis.
Methods
Following the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review to delineate the breadth of research in this field of AI robots in ICU and reported the findings. The literature search was carried out on May 1, 2023, across 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Eligible publications were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts. Publications that passed the preliminary screening underwent a comprehensive review. Various research characteristics were extracted, summarized, and analyzed from the final publications.
Results
Of the 5908 publications screened, 77 (1.3%) underwent a full review. These studies collectively spanned 21 ICU robotics projects, encompassing their system development and testing, clinical trials, and approval processes. Upon an expert-reviewed classification framework, these were categorized into 5 main types: therapeutic assistance robots, nursing assistance robots, rehabilitation assistance robots, telepresence robots, and logistics and disinfection robots. Most of these are already widely deployed and commercialized in ICUs, although a select few remain under testing. All robotic systems and tools are engineered to deliver more personalized, convenient, and intelligent medical services to patients in the ICU, concurrently aiming to reduce the substantial workload on ICU medical staff and promote therapeutic and care procedures. This review further explored the prevailing challenges, particularly focusing on ethical and safety concerns, proposing viable solutions or methodologies, and illustrating the prospective capabilities and potential of AI-driven robotic technologies in the ICU environment. Ultimately, we foresee a pivotal role for robots in a future scenario of a fully automated continuum from admission to discharge within the ICU.
Conclusions
This review highlights the potential of AI robots to transform ICU care by improving patient treatment, support, and rehabilitation processes. However, it also recognizes the ethical complexities and operational challenges that come with their implementation, offering possible solutions for future development and optimization.

AB  - In the last few years, the uptake of cutting-edge technologies in the education system has been expedited, mainly as a reaction to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovations have emphasized the imperative for new and sustainable education practices. Out of the new technologies, the metaverse has potential for high transformative power towards improving teaching and learning experiences, particularly in the context of sustainable development in higher education. Though having immense potential, there has been sparse academic discussion on the use of metaverse-based environments for the promotion of sustainability education. This study seeks to address the gap by presenting a theoretical framework for the uptake of metaverse-based education towards the promotion of sustainable development, and its impact on students' and lecturers' performance. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, covering 105 selected articles on the basis of given keyword combinations. Through bibliometric analysis, the study identifies five major thematic clusters that represent research trends, keyword co-occurrences, citation patterns, and top publications. On that basis, the study formulates a comprehensive agenda for future research that combines metaverse technologies with sustainable education and performance measures. Though findings offer high conceptual inputs, the theoretical direction of the research suggests limitations, and it is recommended that future research should focus on empirical validation of the proposed framework in different education contexts.

AB  - This study introduces the growing necessity of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of cybersecurity, particularly in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially complex neural networks, become more prevalent and difficult to understand, the opacity of these models poses increasing risks in critical firald like cybersecurity. XAI aims to address these concerns by making AI models and their outputs more interpretable and transparent, thus fostering trust and secure use. Despite the rising interest and application of XAI in various domains, its integration into IDSs remains insufficient. This research provides a comprehensive overview of XAI, examining its definitions, terminologies, and the evolution of the field. It delves into the opportunities, challenges, and research needs within XAI, as well as the latest developments, tools, and technologies for implementing XAI in AI-based IDSs, alongside associated risks. The study also summarizes and demonstrates a gap in the literature regarding comprehensive reviews of IDS solutions that incorporate XAI, aiming to fill this gap by detailing the application of XAI in IDS research. The findings are expected to guide researchers, experts, users, and policymakers in the domains of AI, XAI, and IDS.
