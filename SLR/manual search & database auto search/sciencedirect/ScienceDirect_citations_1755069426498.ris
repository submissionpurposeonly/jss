AB  - In 2020, the alleged wilful and gross negligence of four social workers, who did not notice and failed to report the risks to an eight-year-old boy's life from the violent abuses by his mother and her boyfriend back in 2013, ultimately leading to his death, had been heavily criticised.11*Trang Anh MAC, LLM.

However, like other applications of AI in our modern world, in the public sector, Algorithmic Decisions Making and Support systems, it is also denounced because of the data and algorithmic bias.88N.

Therefore, this humble research is a glance through the problems - the bias and discrimination of AI based Administrative Decision Making and Support systems. At first, I determined the bias and discrimination, their blur boundary between two definitions from the legal perspective, then went into the details of the causes of bias in each stage of AI system development, mainly as the results of bias data sources and human decisions in the past, society and political contexts, and the developers’ ethics. In the same chapter, I presented the non-discrimination legal framework, including their application and convergence with the administration laws in regard to the automated decision making and support systems, as well as the involvement of ethics and regulations on personal data protection. In the next chapter, I tried to outline new proposals for potential solutions from both legal and technical perspectives. In respect to the former, my focus was fairness definitions and other current options for the developers, for example, the toolkits, benchmark datasets, debiased data, etc. For the latter, I reported the strategies and new proposals governing the datasets and AI systems development, implementation in the near future.

AB  - The next decade will see new geological mapping of the surface of Venus spurred by multiple new science missions. Planetary scientists must be cognisant of gaps in our understanding of the geology of the second planet in order to plan and maximise the scientific value of these new missions. While our current knowledge of major aspects of volcanology and broad-scale tectonic features on Venus is reasonably advanced, within the limitations of available data. However, the same cannot be said of the basic structural geology of venusian extensional and shortening, and strike-slip features. Published interpretations of distributed extensional tectonic features on Venus do not account for the absence of associated regional strain localisation. Models of shortening tectonic features on Venus are based on structural geological analogies with potentially similar features elsewhere in the inner Solar System. However, the purported analogues on Mercury, Mars and the Moon, as well as commonly invoked terrestrial analogues, have their own issues, which have not been acknowledged or treated in the literature. In addition, empirical application of terrestrial map patterns as analogues for identifying and analysing strike-slip shearing on Venus has not taken account of the established Earth-based determinants of crustal-scale shear zone development. Application of the current state of basic structural geology on Venus to provide constraints on models of planet-scale tectonic behaviour, and their potential extension to the early Earth, is premature. Accordingly, it is both appropriate and timely to critically review the current state of basic structural geological understanding of Venus, with reference to the inner Solar System as a whole. Strategies are proposed for addressing some of the fundamental gaps in our understanding of the basic structural geology of Venus using both analogue modelling and currently available remotely-sensed data while awaiting the results of the planned new science missions in the mid-2030s.

AB  - Oral inhalation is the preferred route for delivery of small molecules to the lungs, because high tissue levels can be achieved shortly after application. Biologics are mainly administered by intravenous injection but inhalation might be beneficial for the treatment of lung diseases (e.g. asthma). This review discusses biological and pharmaceutical challenges for delivery of biologics and describes promising candidates. Insufficient stability of the proteins during aerosolization and the biological environment of the lung are the main obstacles for pulmonary delivery of biologics. Novel nebulizers will improve delivery by inducing less shear stress and administration as dry powder appears suitable for delivery of biologics. Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. Several biologics are being tested for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, and it is expected that these trials will lead to improvements in pulmonary delivery of biologics.

AB  - Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has few available treatments, and there is a high rate of failure in AD drug development programs. Study of the AD drug development pipeline can provide insight into the evolution of drug development and how best to optimize development practices.
Methods
We reviewed clinicaltrials.gov and identified all pharmacologic AD trials of all agents currently being developed for treatment of AD.
Results
There are 132 agents in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Twenty-eight agents are in 42 phase 3 trials; 74 agents are in 83 phase 2 trials; and 30 agents are in 31 phase 1 trials. There is an increase in the number of agents in each phase compared with that in the 2018 pipeline. Nineteen agents in trials target cognitive enhancement, and 14 are intended to treat neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. There are 96 agents in disease modification trials; of these, 38 (40%) have amyloid as the primary target or as one of several effects. Eighteen of the antiamyloid agents are small molecules, and 20 are monoclonal antibodies or biological therapies. Seven small molecules and ten biologics have tau as a primary or combination target (18%). Amyloid is the most common specific target in phase 3 and phase 2 disease modification trials. Novel biomarkers (e.g., neurofilament light), new outcomes (e.g., AD Composite Score [ADCOMS]), enrollment of earlier populations, and innovative trial designs (e.g., Bayesian adaptive designs) are new features in recent clinical trials.
Discussion
Drug development continues robustly at all phases despite setbacks in several programs in the recent past. Continuing unmet needs require a commitment to growing and accelerating the pipeline.

AB  - Objectives
Sarcopenia is a generalized and progressive skeletal muscle disorder and has been proven to be associated with many diseases; however, the correlation between sarcopenia and pain has not yet been systematically clarified. This review aimed to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with pain and to ascertain whether pain is independently associated with sarcopenia.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Setting and Participants
A systematic literature search was performed from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, In-Data-Review, and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions for observational studies from inception until February 2021, and our search was updated on December 31, 2021.
Methods
Sarcopenia prevalence was calculated according to the corresponding number of patients with sarcopenia and pain. We performed meta-analyses with random effects models to calculate the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia in pain and its correlations. Subgroup analyses were also performed based on pain classification, pain location, and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia. Heterogeneity between the studies was described using the I2 statistic.
Results
Fourteen observational studies (13,953 participants, 44% women, and mean age from 40.1 to 76.6 years) were included. Study quality was rated moderate to high. The overall sarcopenia prevalence in patients with pain was 0.11 (95% CI 0.07–0.15, P < .001; I2 = 92.3%). People with pain were independently associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia than those without pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.35; 95% CI 1.17–1.56; P = .025; I2 = 51.1%]. Subgroup analyses showed that the cumulative prevalence and effect measures of sarcopenia were increased when individuals suffered secondary musculoskeletal pain (Prevalence = 12%; OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.19–1.78) and low back pain (Prevalence = 21%; OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.22–3.12).
Conclusions and Implications
The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with pain is relatively high, and pain is significantly associated with sarcopenia in older adults. Attention is needed to screen sarcopenia among patients with pain and optimize its early detection and management in clinical practice.

AB  - The dynamic autonomy resulting from control mode transitions in the Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) poses a significant risk to its navigation safety. While Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) has proven effective in the hazard identification of autonomous ships, the safety challenges inherent in the dynamic autonomy of MASS with seafarers onboard controlled by three possible controllers have not been addressed much. This study proposes a three-phase framework that combines STPA, state machines and Sequentially Timed Events Plotting (STEP) diagram aiming at identifying failure scenarios in the transition process. Findings from a case study highlight the need for such a framework to understand the triggering events for mode transition, the transition process, how transition failure may occur, and refine safety constraints to ensure smooth and safe transitions. The results lay the groundwork for future research into test case generation methods that focus on these identified transition failure scenarios, intending to ensure safe and secure navigation for the progressive introduction of MASS.

AB  - Abinitis a material- and nanostructure-oriented package that implements density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) to find, from first principles, numerous properties including total energy, electronic structure, vibrational and thermodynamic properties, different dielectric and non-linear optical properties, and related spectra. In the special issue to celebrate the 40th anniversary of CPC, published in 2009, a detailed account of Abinitwas included [Gonze et al. (2009)], and has been amply cited. The present article comes as a follow-up to this 2009 publication. It includes an analysis of the impact that Abinithas had, through for example the bibliometric indicators of the 2009 publication. Links with several other computational materials science projects are described. This article also covers the new capabilities of Abinitthat have been implemented during the last three years, complementing a recent update of the 2009 article published in 2016. Physical and technical developments inside the abinit application are covered, as well as developments provided with the Abinitpackage, such as the multibinitand a-tdepprojects, and related Abinitorganization developments such as AbiPy. The new developments are described with relevant references, input variables, tests, and tutorials.

AB  - Historically, researchers have proposed and applied many techniques to reduce the cost of mutation testing. It has become difficult to find all techniques and to understand the cost-benefit tradeoffs among them, which is critical to transitioning this technology to practice. This paper extends a prior workshop paper to summarize and analyze the current knowledge about reducing the cost of mutation testing through a systematic literature review. We selected 175 peer-reviewed studies, from which 153 present either original or updated contributions. Our analysis resulted in six main goals for cost reduction and 21 techniques. In the last decade, a growing number of studies explored techniques such as selective mutation, evolutionary algorithms, control-flow analysis, and higher-order mutation. Furthermore, we characterized 18 metrics, with particular interest in the number of mutants to be executed, test cases required, equivalent mutants generated and detected, and mutant execution speedup. We found that cost reduction for mutation is increasingly becoming interdisciplinary, often combining multiple techniques. Additionally, measurements vary even for studies that use the same techniques. Researchers can use our results to find more detailed information about particular techniques, and to design comparable and reproducible experiments.

AB  - Mobile app development is hindered by device fragmentation and vendor-specific modifications. Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing. Therefore, additional support for app developers is warranted.

KW  - Data fusion
AB  - The current single granularity-based static prediction approaches face difficulties in capturing the dynamic trend of stock markets by the fusion of historical prices and streaming textual data (e.g., financial news, financial reports, and tweets). Besides, the traditional stock predictions by two-way decisions do not consider the continual investigation of the uncertain samples in boundary regions, thus increasing financial risk and loss. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel sequential three-way stock prediction model under the multilevel granular structure of hybrid data. We construct three kinds of multi-granularity methods to combine price and textual data, i.e., high-frequency data with features extracted by Sentiment Analysis (senthigh), high-frequency data with features extracted by BERT (berthigh), and low-frequency data with features extracted by BERT (bertlow). Subsequently, we employ sequential three-way decisions to continually predict the future trend of each test sample at adequate granularity. In addition, an autonomous attention mechanism is embedded inside the CNN and RNN to handle large embeddings and long time series dynamically. Finally, the comparative experiments are conducted on 5-year stock data to demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the non-sequential two-way predictions.

AB  - Much of the law of admissibility of scientific expert testimony has arisen from legal cases involving the discipline of toxicology. Consequently, veterinarians and veterinary specialists, including toxicologists, are called upon to provide medical evidence. This chapter uses a hypothetical example of legal issues that may arise in an animal toxicosis case to illustrate application of the law. It is intended to introduce toxicologists, and other scientists, to a broad overview of some of the legal issues that may arise when a medical case becomes a legal case. This chapter is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the law, but, rather, it is intended to introduce toxicologists and other scientists to a broad overview of some of the legal issues that may arise when a medical case becomes a legal case. The chapter concludes with some questions one may contemplate when analyzing a toxicology case that has legal implications.

AB  - Context
Technical Debt (TD) contextualizes the technical decisions on shortcuts and workarounds during software development, positively and negatively influencing software evolution. However, TD still seems to confound with any issue occurring during software development, impacting its proper understanding and management in software projects.
Goal
To synthesize evidence regarding the conceptualization, characteristics, and management of TD in software projects.
Method
To undertake a tertiary study to strengthen the knowledge of TD using the principles of Grounded Theory to support qualitative analysis.
Results
Nineteen secondary studies provide evidence on TD and its management. They provided information regarding the TD's understanding (definitions and characteristics) and management (actions and technologies). Some causes, such as project constraints, technical decisions, and team members, promote different types of TD in software projects. The secondary studies also supported identifying the impacts of TD regarding project management, team members, the organization's business, and internal software quality. Besides helping identify TD challenges, such studies contributed to integrating a conjectured conceptual model of TD that can support future discussions and investigations regarding TD's understanding and management.
Conclusions
The set of evidence regarding TD's understanding, actions, and technologies to manage TD can aid software practitioners in their software projects. However, it is observable an interpretation overload regarding its definition, inducing to classify any issue occurring during the software development as TD. Therefore, further discussions and investigations still represent essential steps towards consolidating a common perspective on TD and its management.

AB  - Emerging organometal halide solar cells have attracted wide attention as “perovskite solar cells (PSCs)” from very many researchers, and the related articles more than 4000 have been published to date. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 22% was achieved within a few years from the advent of the PSCs. In this review article, publications about the PSCs were summarized along their ‘submitted date’, to record the course of the progress. At the first stage, the PSCs were established as nano-structured solar cells. The efficiency up to 15% attracted the researchers in dye-sensitized solar cells and organic thin-film solar cells. After the appearance of planar hetero-junction type PSCs, the power generation mechanism has been argued. Around that time, several issues arose, such as I–V hysteresis and chloride contents. Although there were several severe comments about these issues, the developments of the PSCs progressed steadily, then efficiencies over 20% were reported. At present, the highest PCE in published papers is 22.6%, and the NREL chart records 22.7%. The development history of the PSCs is summarized in this review.

AB  - Energy performance certificates (EPC) were introduced in European Union to support reaching energy efficiency targets by informing actors in the building sector about energy efficiency in buildings. While EPC have become a core source of information about building energy, the domains of its applications have not been studied systematically. This partly explains the limitation of conventional EPC data quality studies that fail to expose the essential problems and secure effective use of the data. This study reviews existing applications of EPC data and proposes a new method for assessing the quality of EPCs using data analytics. Thirteen application domains were identified from systematic mapping of 79 papers, revealing increases in the number and complexity of studies and advances in applied data analysis techniques. The proposed data quality assurance method based on six validation levels was tested using four samples of EPC dataset for the case of Sweden. The analysis showed that EPC data can be improved through adding or revising the EPC features and assuring interoperability of EPC datasets. In conclusion, EPC data have wider applications than initially intended by the EPC policy instrument, placing stronger requirements on the quality and content of the data.

AB  - Context: Software Product Lines (SPL) evolve when there are changes in the requirements, product structure or the technology being used. Different approaches have been proposed for managing SPL assets and some also address how evolution affects these assets. Existing mapping studies have focused on specific aspects of SPL evolution, but there is no cohesive body of work that gives an overview of the area as a whole. Objective: The goals of this work are to review the characteristics of the approaches reported as supporting SPL evolution, and to synthesize the evidence provided by primary studies about the nature of their processes, as well as how they are reported and validated. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review, considering six research questions formulated to evaluate evolution approaches for SPL. We considered journal, conference and workshop papers published up until March 2017 in leading digital libraries for computer science. Results: After a thorough analysis of the papers retrieved from the digital libraries, we ended up with a set of 60 primary studies. Feature models are widely used to represent SPLs, so feature evolution is frequently addressed. Other assets are less frequently addressed. The area has matured over time: papers presenting more rigorous work are becoming more common. The processes used to support SPL evolution are systematic, but with a low level of automation. Conclusions: Our research shows that there is no consensus about SPL formalization, what assets can evolve, nor how and when these evolve. Case studies are quite popular, but few industrial-sized case studies are publicly available. Also, few of the proposed techniques offer tool support. We believe that the SPL community needs to work together to improve the state of the art, creating methods and tools that support SPL evolution in a more comparable manner.

AB  - At the heart of affective computing lies the crucial task of decoding human emotions, a field that expertly intertwines emotion identification with the nuances of sentiment analysis. This dynamic discipline harnesses an array of data sources, from the intricacies of textual information to the subtleties of auditory signals and the dynamic realm of visual cues. One of its primary challenges is discerning emotions from physical cues like facial expressions and vocal tones, especially when these emotions are subtly concealed. The precise information yielded by physiological signals is invaluable, yet the complexity of their acquisition in real-world settings remains a formidable challenge. Our comprehensive systematic review marks a significant foray into trimodal affective computing, integrating text, audio, and visual data to provide a holistic understanding. We analyzed over 410 research articles from prominent conferences and journals spanning the last two decades. This extensive study categorizes and critically evaluates a spectrum of affect recognition methods, from unimodal to multimodal approaches, including bimodal and trimodal, offering profound insights into their structural composition and practical effectiveness. In concluding our exploration, we highlight the pivotal aspects of affective computing and chart a course for future groundbreaking research. This includes refining data integration techniques, overcoming challenges in emotion recognition, and addressing the critical ethical dimensions inherent in this field.

AB  - Context:
Continuous experimentation and A/B testing is an established industry practice that has been researched for more than 10 years. Our aim is to synthesize the conducted research.
Objective:
We wanted to find the core constituents of a framework for continuous experimentation and the solutions that are applied within the field. Finally, we were interested in the challenges and benefits reported of continuous experimentation.
Methods:
We applied forward snowballing on a known set of papers and identified a total of 128 relevant papers. Based on this set of papers we performed two qualitative narrative syntheses and a thematic synthesis to answer the research questions.
Results:
The framework constituents for continuous experimentation include experimentation processes as well as supportive technical and organizational infrastructure. The solutions found in the literature were synthesized to nine themes, e.g. experiment design, automated experiments, or metric specification. Concerning the challenges of continuous experimentation, the analysis identified cultural, organizational, business, technical, statistical, ethical, and domain-specific challenges. Further, the study concludes that the benefits of experimentation are mostly implicit in the studies.
Conclusion:
The research on continuous experimentation has yielded a large body of knowledge on experimentation. The synthesis of published research presented within include recommended infrastructure and experimentation process models, guidelines to mitigate the identified challenges, and what problems the various published solutions solve.

AB  - It is well-known that the “Unsorted Database” quantum algorithm by Grover gives quadratic speedup to several practically important combinatorial and enumerative problems, such as: SAT, Graph Coloring, Maximum Cliques, Traveling Salesman and many others. Recently, quantum programming languages such as QISKIT, QSHARP or Quipper start to be used to design, verify and simulate practical quantum algorithms for important problems in Quantum Machine Learning or optimization. So far, however, no methodologies have been created to program Grover's Oracles for particular classes of problems. In contrast, such methodologies have been already created for classical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). Invertible Logic was recently introduced by Supriyo Datta and his team. The goal of this paper is to present results of our research towards creating a systematic methodology to solve search problems in Artificial Intelligence, Logic Design and Machine Learning by repeated applications of modified hardware oracles. These oracles can use: (1) classical Boolean logic, (2) quantum logic, or (3) invertible logic. Our methodology to design and exercise all types of general oracles is based on bottom-up synthesis and technology transformations. For CSP problems we apply unified blocks which use various data representations and encodings.

AB  - Purpose
To assess the state of supply chain management (SCM) research in India and to understand the research trends and methodologies used. The present study also aims to create a taxonomy of the subject areas researched in India.
Design/methodology/approach
The present study employed the systematic literature review methodology. Literature from 395 peer journal papers in 67 leading journals over a 20-year period (2000–2020 Quarter-1) was comprehensively reviewed and assessed.
Findings
SCM research in India started around the year 2000. The quantum of research was low (single digit) until 2010. There has been steady growth over the last decade, and over 50% of the total papers up until now has been published in the last four years. The present study created a three-tiered taxonomy of the subject areas and classified the papers as per it. The first tier (level-1) has seven categories (SCM strategy, network design, SCM processes and integration, IT systems, skills, performance measurement and others). A perusal of the newly created taxonomy revealed that, except for a few areas under level-1 categories (such as SCM processes and SCM strategy), the other level-1 categories have not seen much research. Similarly, there is little or no research in a large number of level-2 categories (such as outsourcing strategy, channel strategy, demand management, demand fulfillment, customer relationship management, integrated supply chain planning, new product development, returns, supply chain orientation, performance monitoring, performance improvement, SCM adoption process, SCM implementation issues and quantified benefits of SCM). Methodologically, the rigor of SCM research in India needs improvement.
Originality/value
A comprehensive taxonomy of SCM subject areas researched in India at three cascading levels was created for the first time in the present study. The taxonomy will help provide researchers with a clear understanding of the structure of the subject areas and help in identifying areas where research has been carried out and the subject areas where gaps exist for future research to proceed. The present study also provides an overview of the methodological rigor of SCM research in India and points out some of the limitations that researchers should avoid in future studies.

AB  - Objectives
To review current methods for informing nurse workforce decisions in critical care. Many clinical outcomes are worse if staffing is inadequate. Workforce planning is usually according to guidelines developed from the opinions of expert groups. Objective systems for planning and distributing staff have been developed but their value is unclear.
Design
A rapid review methodology was employed.
Review methods
The search included research studies, guidelines and surveys within and outside United Kingdom since 1995.
Findings
Thirty-two studies met eligibility criteria. Studies originated worldwide, with considerable work undertaken in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Two were large multicentre studies. Tools examined fell into three groups: those focused on the condition and needs of the patient, those focused on the number and time for nursing activities and those that also took account of psycho-social factors. Many tools were not used beyond their country of origin.
Conclusion
There is limited experience of using tools to determine nurse staffing. No one tool is likely to suit every application. More information is needed to clarify the practicalities of using the tools.

AB  - Nanomaterials are substances that are, or have been, reduced in size to the range from 1 nm to ~100 nm (i.e. 1 to ~100 nanometers, or 1 to ~100 × 10-9 meters). Nanotechnology is the science and applications of nano-materials, and is growing at an ever increasing pace. At this particle size the properties of materials can be altered dramatically. Properties such as solubility, reactivity, spectroscopy, electrical and magnetic, transport through membranes etc. are generally different from those of the same materials with large particle size. The applications of materials of nano size have escalated in the last fifteen or so years and are currently gaining momentum. The technology has broad applications in performance materials, health, consumer products, water, information technology and energy. The discovery of fullerenes (1996 Nobel Prize for Chemistry to H.W. Kroto, R.E. Smalley and R.F. Curl) and of Graphene (2010 Nobel Prize for Physics to A. Geim and K Novoselov) are very important factors in the development of nanotechnology. Not very many nanomaterials have so far been included in chemical catalogues of commercially available substances, e.g. as compared with catalysts (although some catalysts are now available as nanoparticles), hence the relatively smaller size of this chapter. Fullerenes and related materials such as carbon nanotubes have found applications in medicine for the transport of drugs and biological materials to targeted sites and some readily available derivatives are described in this chapter, together with other commercially available nanoparticulate substances, e.g. catalysts, magnetic and electrically conducting thin films, and quantum dots. General safety aspects of handling nanomaterials have been briefly addressed. Nanoscience and nanotechnology is developing explosively as the awareness and usefulness of materials at the nano scale is becoming evident. In the past few years this has resulted in the appearance of an enormous number of journals and periodicals in which scientific, technological and medical discoveries are readily published. Several of these publications are listed at the end of this chapter and can be accessed via their International Standard Series Numbers (ISSNs). A large number of books have also been published on these subjects and can be accessed via their International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs).

AB  - Sustainable and cleaner manufacturing systems have found broad applications in industrial processes, especially aerospace, automotive and power generation. Conventional manufacturing methods are highly unsustainable regarding carbon emissions, energy consumption, material wastage, costly shipment and complex supply management. Besides, during global COVID-19 pandemic, advanced fabrication and management strategies were extremely required to fulfill the shortfall of basic and medical emergency supplies. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) reduces global energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to industrial manufacturing. Various renewable energy harvesting mechanisms utilizing solar, wind, tidal and human potential have been fabricated through additive manufacturing. 3D printing aided the manufacturing companies in combating the deficiencies of medical healthcare devices for patients and professionals globally. In this regard, 3D printed medical face shields, respiratory masks, personal protective equipment, PLA-based recyclable air filtration masks, additively manufactured ideal tissue models and new information technology (IT) based rapid manufacturing are some significant contributions of 3DP. Furthermore, a bibliometric study of 3D printing research was conducted in CiteSpace. The most influential keywords and latest research frontiers were found and the 3DP knowledge was categorized into 10 diverse research themes. The potential challenges incurred by AM industry during the pandemic were categorized in terms of design, safety, manufacturing, certification and legal issues. Significantly, this study highlights the versatile role of 3DP in battle against COVID-19 pandemic and provides up-to-date research frontiers, leading the readers to focus on the current hurdles encountered by AM industry, henceforth conduct further investigations to enhance 3DP technology.

AB  - During the mid-Middle Pleistocene MIS 14 to MIS 11, humans spread through Western Europe from the Mediterranean peninsulas to the sub-Arctic region, and they did so not only during the warm periods but also during the glacial stages. In doing so, they were exposed to harsh environmental conditions, including low or extremely low temperatures. Here we review the distribution of archeological assemblages in Western Europe from MIS 14 to MIS 11 and obtain estimates of the climatic conditions at those localities. Estimates of the mean annual temperature, mean winter and summer temperatures, and the lowest temperature of the coldest month for each locality were obtained from the Oscillayers database. Our results show that hominins endured cold exposure not only during the glacial stages but also during the interglacials, with winter temperatures below 0 °C at many localities. The efficacy of the main physiological and behavioral adaptations that might have been used by the Middle Pleistocene hominins to cope with low temperatures is evaluated using a simple heat-loss model. Our results suggest that physiological and anatomical adaptations alone, such as increasing basal metabolic rate and subcutaneous adipose tissue, were not enough to tolerate the low winter temperatures of Western Europe, even during the MIS 13 and MIS 11 interglacials. In contrast, the use of a simple fur bed cover appears to have been an extremely effective response to low temperatures. We suggest that advanced fire production and control technology were not necessary for the colonization of northern Europe during MIS 14 and MIS 12. We propose that Middle Pleistocene European populations were able to endure the low temperatures of those glacial stages combining anatomical and physiological adaptations with behavioral responses, such as the use of shelter and simple fur clothes.

AB  - Cyber security is attracting worldwide attention. With attacks being more and more common and often successful, no one is spared today. Threat modeling is proposed as a solution for secure application development and system security evaluations. Its aim is to be more proactive and make it more difficult for attackers to accomplish their malicious intents. However, threat modeling is a domain that lacks common ground. What is threat modeling, and what is the state-of-the-art work in this field? To answer these questions, this article presents a review of threat modeling based on systematic queries in four leading scientific databases. This is the first systematic literature review on threat modeling to the best of our knowledge. 176 articles were assessed, and 54 of them were selected for further analysis. We identified three separate clusters: (1) articles making a contribution to threat modeling, e.g., introducing a new method, (2) articles using an existing threat modeling approach, and (3) introductory articles presenting work related to the threat modeling process. The three clusters were analyzed in terms of a set of criteria, for instance: Is the threat modeling approach graphical or formal? Is it focused on a specific attack type and application? Is the contribution validated empirically or theoretically? We observe from the results that, most threat modeling work remains to be done manually, and there is limited assurance of their validations. The results can be used for researchers and practitioners who want to know the state-of-the-art threat modeling methods, and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Jet fuels derived from biomass (bio-derived sustainable aviation fuels or BSAFs) offer a means of reducing net carbon emissions from aviation. Drop-in substitute fuels are attractive for use with existing and near-future aviation fleets and fueling infrastructure. Yet fuels derived from different biomass feedstock and produced by different production pathways have different fuel properties. These fuel property differences—especially ignition properties—offer challenges. This chapter discusses the current status, challenges, and opportunities of BSAFs. Strategies for closer property matching and for modeling and dealing with varied and uncontrolled properties are highlighted.

AB  - Context
Software maintainability is one of the fundamental quality attributes of software engineering. The accurate prediction of software maintainability is a significant challenge for the effective management of the software maintenance process.
Objective
The major aim of this paper is to present a systematic review of studies related to the prediction of maintainability of object-oriented software systems using machine learning techniques. This review identifies and investigates a number of research questions to comprehensively summarize, analyse and discuss various viewpoints concerning software maintainability measurements, metrics, datasets, evaluation measures, individual models and ensemble models.
Method
The review uses the standard systematic literature review method applied to the most common computer science digital database libraries from January 1991 to July 2018.
Results
We survey 56 relevant studies in 35 journals and 21 conference proceedings. The results indicate that there is relatively little activity in the area of software maintainability prediction compared with other software quality attributes. CHANGE maintenance effort and the maintainability index were the most commonly used software measurements (dependent variables) employed in the selected primary studies, and most made use of class-level product metrics as the independent variables. Several private datasets were used in the selected studies, and there is a growing demand to publish datasets publicly. Most studies focused on regression problems and performed k-fold cross-validation. Individual prediction models were employed in the majority of studies, while ensemble models relatively rarely.
Conclusion
Based on the findings obtained in this systematic literature review, ensemble models demonstrated increased accuracy prediction over individual models, and have been shown to be useful models in predicting software maintainability. However, their application is relatively rare and there is a need to apply these, and other models to an extensive variety of datasets with the aim of improving the accuracy and consistency of results.

AB  - The GEOTRACES Intermediate Data Product 2017 (IDP2017) is the second publicly available data product of the international GEOTRACES programme, and contains data measured and quality controlled before the end of 2016. The IDP2017 includes data from the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans, with about twice the data volume of the previous IDP2014. For the first time, the IDP2017 contains data for a large suite of biogeochemical parameters as well as aerosol and rain data characterising atmospheric trace element and isotope (TEI) sources. The TEI data in the IDP2017 are quality controlled by careful assessment of intercalibration results and multi-laboratory data comparisons at crossover stations. The IDP2017 consists of two parts: (1) a compilation of digital data for more than 450 TEIs as well as standard hydrographic parameters, and (2) the eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas providing an on-line atlas that includes more than 590 section plots and 130 animated 3D scenes. The digital data are provided in several formats, including ASCII, Excel spreadsheet, netCDF, and Ocean Data View collection. Users can download the full data packages or make their own custom selections with a new on-line data extraction service. In addition to the actual data values, the IDP2017 also contains data quality flags and 1-σ data error values where available. Quality flags and error values are useful for data filtering and for statistical analysis. Metadata about data originators, analytical methods and original publications related to the data are linked in an easily accessible way. The eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas is the visual representation of the IDP2017 as section plots and rotating 3D scenes. The basin-wide 3D scenes combine data from many cruises and provide quick overviews of large-scale tracer distributions. These 3D scenes provide geographical and bathymetric context that is crucial for the interpretation and assessment of tracer plumes near ocean margins or along ridges. The IDP2017 is the result of a truly international effort involving 326 researchers from 25 countries. This publication provides the critical reference for unpublished data, as well as for studies that make use of a large cross-section of data from the IDP2017. This article is part of a special issue entitled: "Cycles of trace elements and isotopes in the ocean – GEOTRACES and beyond" - edited by Tim M. Conway, Tristan Horner, Yves Plancherel, and Aridane G. González.

AB  - Radiative cooling (RC) can provide free cooling by emitting radiative heat into outer space. This article presents the effects of solar radiation, non-radiative heat gains, atmospheric conditions, and spectral selectivity on the performance of radiative cooling technologies. Radiative cooling materials, including polymeric structures, pigmented paints, and photonic structures, are also reviewed. The benefits of integrating RC structures into buildings are reviewed, including estimates of energy and cost savings, and payback period. Methods for determining the global warming potential (GWP) when carrying out a life-cycle assessment (LCA) for RC structures are also presented. These LCA methods include two primary mechanisms through which radiative cooling technologies reduce GWP: 1) by directly reducing radiative forcing by radiating energy to outer space, and 2) by indirectly reducing radiative forcing by decreasing cooling loads, which reduces the CO2 emissions associated with providing power for cooling. Estimates for exemplary case studies show that by installing radiative cooling technologies the GWP for cooling houses in Jamaica, Ghana and Brazil over a 20 year period can be reduced by ∼40,000 kg CO2-eq, ∼14,000 kgCO2-eq, and ∼22,000 kgCO2-eq, respectively. In most cases, the dominant reason for the decrease in the GWP is the reduction in CO2 emissions achieved by reducing the building cooling load. However, the emission of long wavelength radiation and the corresponding reduction in radiative forcing is significant and is the dominant factor reducing the GWP for some cases. The limitations and future prospects for RC technologies in building applications are also discussed.

AB  - Legitimation is often theorized as a form of consensus and implicitly treated as an end-state that obtains after the unfolding of a process. Conflict and disagreement are recognized as part of legitimation processes; however, scholarship emphasizes consensus-building over contestation. Moreover, as legitimacy processes are always ongoing and never final, such contestation can persist even in legitimated fields. We bring together Baumann's (2007) general theory of artistic legitimation and field theories (Bourdieu, 1993; Fligstein & McAdam, 2012) in order to develop an approach to artistic legitimacy that accounts for conflict and contestation as much as consensus in legitimacy processes. We use a historical case study to build theory on legitimacy struggles in aesthetic fields. Specifically, we examine the legitimation of Outsider art, an aesthetic field defined as work by artists who produce outside established art worlds and who come from disadvantaged social worlds. Artist William Edmondson serves as an exemplar to ground our discussion of the Outsider field as we focus on resources, opportunity spaces, and legitimating discourses (Baumann, 2007) over time, to produce a multilevel and multifaceted approach to legitimation in aesthetic fields. In this way, our approach calls attention to ongoing legitimacy struggles in legitimated fields. We hypothesize that legitimacy struggles are more common in fields where judgement criteria are ambiguous, multiple players have a stake, and/or where resources are changing.

AB  - Through the combination of virtual and real, multi-dimensional perception, and accurate mapping, digital twin (DT) could describe the physical world in real-time and provide a theoretical basis for simulation, prediction, control, etc. In recent years, DT has been used in many sectors including the construction industry. From the needs of the construction industry, DT could help the technological progress of construction's whole life cycle. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current development of construction industry and DT, following by proposing a conceptual framework for DT-enabled construction lifecycle management. Firstly, by analysing the research status of each phase in the construction lifecycle, the challenges facing the construction lifecycle are summarized. Then, the characteristics and challenges of DT were summarized based on its origins, concepts and applications. A “3 + 1”D DT-enabled construction lifecycle management framework was proposed after reviewing the construction industry and DT. Then, the challenges and opportunities in using the framework are discussed. This research helps understand the challenges and great potential of applying DT in the construction lifecycle.

AB  - In the automotive domain, the development of all safety-critical systems has to comply with safety standards such as ISO 26262. These standards require established traceability, the ability to relate artifacts created during development of a system, to ensure resulting systems are well-tested and therefore safe. This paper contrasts general traceability challenges and solutions with those specific to the automotive domain, and investigates how they manifest in practice. We combine three data sources: a tertiary literature review to identify general challenges and solutions; a case study with an automotive supplier as validation for how the challenges and solutions are experienced in practice; and a multi-vocal literature review to identify challenges and solutions specific to the automotive domain. We found 22 challenges and 16 unique solutions in the reviews. 17 challenges were identified in the case study; six remain unsolved. We discuss challenges and solutions from the perspectives of academia, tool vendors, consultants and users, and identify differences between scientific and “grey” literature. We discuss why challenges remain unsolved and propose solutions. Our findings indicate that there is a significant overlap between general traceability challenges and those in the automotive domain but that they are experienced differently.

AB  - Computational design based on three-dimensional (3D) protein structural information is now fully embedded in the drug discovery process, with structure-based drug design playing a critical part in many well-known marketed drug stories. The 3D structure information may have come from an X-ray crystal structure, a homology model based on a similar protein, an NMR-derived structure, or more recently from electron cryo-microscopy (3DEM). Other new techniques such as hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry can also provide complementary information on the location of ligand binding sites, the impact of ligand binding on solvent accessibility, and changes in protein flexibility. However, X-ray crystallography remains the dominant source of 3D data.

Technology-assisted MI may provide a more efficient way to promote readiness and facilitate behavior change. This study developed the Technology Assisted Motivational Interviewing Coach (TAMI), a digital conversational agent that incorporates machine learning models to deliver MI for tobacco cessation and create tailored quit plans. This manuscript describes and evaluates the architecture and nested machine learning models within TAMI leveraged during the pilot clinical trial.

AB  - Background: Developing and maintaining large scale machine learning (ML) based software systems in an industrial setting is challenging. There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.

AB  - Condition monitoring and predictive maintenance applications receive ongoing scientific attention in production technology. Larger companies, especially machine and component manufacturers, already offer related products. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular show interest in developing and offering solutions in this market themselves to gain economic advantages, to improve resource utilization of their machines or to be able to offer these advantages to their own customers. In the development process, however, they often encounter problems already in the digitization of the machines. The first hurdle is to obtain an analysis-capable data set. This is due to the fact that common and established general data mining development process models, such as CRISP-DM, do not focus on production technology, causing difficulties for engineers during deployment. A problem with existing process models is the limited practicality in the engineering domain due to restricted adaptability. In a previous paper, a guideline for engineers for data mining suitable digitization of production machines was developed in order to solve these problems. The related results were provided in the context of a project for condition monitoring of mixing machines. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to components of a 5-axis CNC milling machine in three different monitoring use cases. A complete workflow is presented, including effect analysis, sensor selection, formulation of predictive scenarios, data preparation, training of machine learning algorithms and vizualization. Data and documentation are provided alongside this publication.

AB  - Oleandrin, a cardiac glycoside isolated from the leaves of Nerium oleander, has known effects on the heart. Evidence from recent studies have highlighted its potential for anticancer properties. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of oleandrin on cancer cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We performed a systematic search in six electronic databases up to Jan 2022. We extracted information about the effects of oleandrin on cell proliferation, cell viability, apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest in in vitro studies, and the effects on tumor size and volume in animal experimental models. We have retrieved 775 scientific studies. 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. They investigated the effects of oleandrin on breast, lung, pancreatic, colon, prostate, colorectal, oral, ovarian, glioma, melanoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, and histiocytic lymphoma cancers. Overall, in vitro studies demonstrated that oleandrin was able to inhibit cell proliferation, decrease cell viability, and induce apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest. In addition, oleandrin had an effect on reducing mean tumor size and volume in animal studies. Oleandrin, as a cytotoxic agent, demonstrated antitumor effects in different types of cancers, however important clinical limitations remain a concern. These results encourage future studies to verify the applicability of oleandrin in antineoplastic therapeutic protocols human and veterinary medicine, the investigation of antimetastatic properties, as well as the potential increase in patient survival and the decrease of tumor markers.

AB  - The first ISO/ASTM joint standards were published in 2013 thanks to the Partner Standards Development Organization (PSDO) agreement to develop only one set of additive manufacturing (AM) standards to be used all over the world. Since then, many experts in different fields of AM have carried out an intense work in the development of new standard documents that help the improvement of countless aspects relating to manufacturing. These include the quality of the manufactured parts with standards aimed at the design of parts for AM, requirements to supply to third parties, the testing procedures, and how to achieve reliable and reproducible processes. Not only the different technologies are covered by the standards, but also the diverse materials used in AM (plastics, composites, metals, ceramics, etc.), as well as many industrial sectors that have adopted the AM as a manufacturing process. Other topics such as fundamentals and vocabularies or environmental issues are also considered. As evidence of the major significance of this subject, the European standardization committee on additive manufacturing CEN TC438 was also constituted, to ensure consistency and harmonization with international standards, by applying as far as possible the Vienna agreement with ISO/TC 261 “Additive Manufacturing” committee. This chapter first presents an update of the existing structure of the AM standardization working groups and their liaisons with other relevant committees. A second section refers to the impact of AM standards, showing how the standard referencing is an indication of its increasingly potential use in the industry.

AB  - This chapter presents medical device standards and their impact on the medical device design process. Although standards have been presented in multiple previous chapters in the text, this chapter explores the various types of standards and standards organizations, the mechanisms by which standards are written, approved, disseminated, and almost universally adopted. Technical standards are especially critical in health care because regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA ), and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, will only clear healthcare products for clinical use that satisfy a specific set of standards related to technology being developed. Most standards are created by one or more standard development organizations (SDOs), which number over 100. In addition to technical standards, there are those that formalize the design processes. One primary standard for health care is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Specifically, ISO 13485 (Medical devices—Quality management systems—Requirements for regulatory purposes), is a primary quality systems standard for medical device companies and includes design controls that impact how medical devices are designed and developed. The chapter explains how design controls formalize the design process and concludes with an example where standards guide a calibration test needed for accuracy.

AB  - Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that develops over decades. AD brain proteomics reveals vast alterations in protein levels and numerous altered biologic pathways. Here, we compare AD brain proteome and network changes with the brain proteomes of amyloid β (Aβ)-depositing mice to identify conserved and divergent protein networks with the conserved networks identifying an Aβ amyloid responsome. Proteins in the most conserved network (M42) accumulate in plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid (CAA), and/or dystrophic neuronal processes, and overexpression of two M42 proteins, midkine (Mdk) and pleiotrophin (PTN), increases the accumulation of Aβ in plaques and CAA. M42 proteins bind amyloid fibrils in vitro, and MDK and PTN co-accumulate with cardiac transthyretin amyloid. M42 proteins appear intimately linked to amyloid deposition and can regulate amyloid deposition, suggesting that they are pathology modifiers and thus putative therapeutic targets. We posit that amyloid-scaffolded accumulation of numerous M42+ proteins is a central mechanism mediating downstream pathophysiology in AD.

AB  - Introduction
Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and general decline in function associated with age, and has previously been shown to be a predictor of poor outcomes following surgery. Computed tomography (CT)-assessed sarcopenia has been proposed to be an independent predictor of outcomes for trauma patients. This systematic review aims to determine the impact of CT-assessed sarcopenia on patient mortality following trauma.
Materials and Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL databases were searched from database inception to 26 November 2018. Bibliographies of included articles were hand searched for potential articles. All observational studies which included trauma patients who had skeletal muscle mass or density assessed by CT were included in the review. Two authors independently performed the search with decisions reached by consensus. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager v5.3 using a random effects model. The primary outcome was all cause mortality, as established a priori.
Results
Following an initial search of 1984 records, a total of 20 retrospective observational studies were included for qualitative analysis. Ten of these studies consisting of a pooled, partly-overlapping, 2867 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There was a wide variation in the reported prevalence of sarcopenia (25.0–71.1%). Sarcopenia patients were at a significantly increased risk of mortality during inpatient stay (RR 1.96 [95%CI 1.30–2.94], p =  0.001), at 30 days (RR 1.60 [95%CI 1.21–2.13], p =  0.001) and at 1-year (RR 3.11 [95%CI 1.94–4.96], p <  0.00001). There was no significant difference in total complications encountered, ICU duration or total inpatient stay.
Conclusion
Sarcopenia identified by CT is associated with increased risk of inpatient, 30-day, and 1-year mortality in trauma patients.

AB  - Fisetin (FS) is a bioactive flavonoid obtained mostly from apple and strawberry and classified under the category of food supplements due to numerous pharmacological effects against various diseases through multiple mechanistic pathways. It acts as excellent neuroprotective, cardioprotective, anti-invasive, anti-tumorigenic, anti-angiogenic, anticancer, antidiabetics, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent. Despite having excellent safety and efficacy profile, FS is very less explored to clinical research either as food supplement or, as therapeutic agent due to its poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability and reduced blood brain barrier permeability. Multiple mechanistic pathways through which FS elicits its pharmacological actions and the challenges associated with FS that compromises therapeutic efficacy are described in this article. The nanoformulations developed to enhance the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of FS are also covered with detailed description of research works carried by various researchers. These include nanoemulsions, liposomes, ethosomes, glycerosomes, polymeric micelles, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system and polymeric nanoparticles. Various patents pertaining to extraction/isolation, formula composition and therapeutic uses of FS as well as some clinical studies conducted using FS as active moiety are also enlisted.

AB  - Directional drilling is older than the currently ubiquitous horizontal drilling technology. However, advances in mastering directional technology are most significant in the post horizontal well surge era. It's because the topic became relevant due to the fact that every horizontal well has a directional component to it. Advances in directional drilling are related to the advances in horizontal drilling but a separate chapter is presented because most of the advances in directional drilling can be traced back to technologies from many decades ago during the golden era of oil and gas. If properly evaluated, all advances in directional drilling technologies are relevant for both vertical and horizontal well drilling.

AB  - The advent of advanced computational and communication technologies, notably 6G, cloud computing and quantum computing, has transformed our daily lives and work processes. 6G network will be much faster than the current 5G network and can connect seamlessly both physical and virtual world for more computation requirements with the cloud and quantum computing. In addition, 6G also has promised to half the carbon emission for building a sustainable future. Nonetheless, these technologies are associated with substantial energy consumption, contributing to a noteworthy 5.5 % of carbon emissions. This research presents a comprehensive sustainability framework aimed at guiding the development of large-scale applications. The framework emphasizes the incorporation of energy-efficient requirements, integration of energy efficiency in the design phase, and the implementation of energy-efficient algorithms leveraging Green Function (utilizing 3rd order differential equations to analyse the energy consumption of cloud applications). The experimental findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving a remarkable 99 % energy efficiency in both cloud and quantum applications.

AB  - The Theranostics approach has full potential to completely transform the contemporary medicine system to a patient-centric approach, as it is emerging in quite efficient manner, over the past few years. The primary impetus of this review is to analyse the patent growth in the domain of breast cancer theranostics. This wholesome analysis provides an insight into the current technological and R & D advancement over the years, in breast cancer theranostics. Thus, guide the end-users in getting the conclusion for policymaking and other public recommendations. This patent assessment also foretells about the future trends to carry out further achievements. Due to their easy availability, information richness, & versatility, patent's role in R&D policy has been emphasized by stake holders of innovation including scientists time to time. Graphical Abstract: The figure illustrates the applied technologies used for breast cancer theranostics by top three forward cited patents (A) The oligonucleotides with specific sequences (comprised of at least one of DNA, RNA, PNA. LNA, UNA or combination)1 are capable of binding a targeted tumor protein (PARP1, HISTIHIB, HISTIHID, NCL, FBL, SFPQ, RPL12, ACTB, HIST1H4A, SSBP1, NONO, H2AFJ, and DDX21, forming a tumor protein complex or subunit or their fragments and might block the tumoral activity. These are also capable of binding to Ramos cells (Derived from Human Burkitt's lymphoma that is negative for Epstein Barr virus). These can also bind cell surface nucleolin and may inhibit cell proliferation. These molecules with detection agent detect the presence or level of disease specific protein. (B) These aptamers with chemical functionalization can be conjugated to an amine linker or high molecular weight non-immunogenic compound or a drug or cytotoxic moiety or labelled with fluorescent agent. These chemically modified aptamers can also bind disease - specific biomarkers e.g., circulating biomarkers, micro- vesicle surface antigens or their functional fragments and can be subsequently used for early diagnosis, prognosis or therapeutic purposes. 1PNA: Peptide Nucleic Acid.

AB  - Software systems are increasingly depending on data, particularly with the rising use of machine learning, and developers are looking for new sources of data. Open Data Ecosystems (ODE) is an emerging concept for data sharing under public licenses in software ecosystems, similar to Open Source Software (OSS). It has certain similarities to Open Government Data (OGD), where public agencies share data for innovation and transparency. We aimed to explore open data ecosystems involving commercial actors. Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs’ value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research. We found that ODE must be value driven. Regarding the intrinsics of data, we found their type, meta-data, and legal frameworks influential for their openness. We also found the characteristics of ecosystem initiation, organization, data acquisition and openness be differentiating, which we advise research and practice to take into consideration.

AB  - The experiences associated with remembering, including metamemory feelings about the act of remembering and attempts at remembering, are not often integrated into general accounts of memory. For example, David Rubin (2022) proposes a unified, three-dimensional conceptual space for mapping memory states, a map that does not systematically specify metamemory feelings. Drawing on Rubin's model, we define a distinct role for metamemory in relation to first-order memory content. We propose a fourth dimension for the model and support the proposal with conceptual, neurocognitive, and clinical lines of reasoning. We use the modified model to illustrate several cases, and show how it helps to conceptualize a new category of memory state: autonoetic knowing, exemplified by déjà vu. We also caution not to assume that memory experience is directly correlated with or caused by memory content, an assumption Tulving (1989) labeled the doctrine of concordance.

AB  - With the advent of the new media era, government social media have become an important paradigm for social governance. We perform a large-sample regression and reveal that the higher the quality of taxation bureaus’ operation of government social media, the lower the degree of local enterprises’ tax avoidance, which works through reducing tax avoidance incentives and increasing the difficulty of committing tax avoidance. Moreover, government social media play a substitution effect on tax enforcement and administration. We also find that government social media should focus on strengthening its official, formal and professional characteristics. Given the significant recent changes in how enterprises handle taxation, the proportion of information that taxation bureaus post on system operation should be appropriately increased.

AB  - Background
PRISm is regarded as a COPD precursor, but whether this varies by smoking status remains unclear.
Research Question
Are annual lung function decline and the risk of developing airflow limitation different among PRISm subtypes by smoking status?
Study Design and Methods
2850 participants from a 15-year population-based prospective cohort were included in this analysis. Participants were categorized into three groups: never smokers with normal spirometry (normal control), never smokers with PRISm (NS-PRISm), and ever smokers with PRISm (ES-PRISm). We compared the annual lung function decline and the risk of developing airflow limitation among the three groups.
Results
Participants in the normal control group exhibited the faster decline in annual lung function, followed by the ES-PRISm group, with the NS-PRISm group showing the slowest decline. Participants in the ES-PRISm group had a significant faster annual lung function decline than NS-PRISm group. Participants in the ES-PRISm group had a significantly increased risk of developing airflow limitation than NS-PRISm group (95/256 [37.1%] vs 69/470 [14.7%], adjusted HR: 1.90 [95%CI: 1.31 to 2.77], P=0.001) and normal control group (95/256 [37.1%] vs 193/2124 [9.1%], adjusted HR: 2.69 [95%CI: 1.96 to 3.69], P<0.001). Besides, participants in the NS-PRISm group also exhibited a higher risk of developing airflow limitation than those in the normal control group (69/470 [14.7%] vs 193/2124 [9.1%], adjusted HR: 1.41 [95%CI: 1.07 to 1.87], P=0.016). When the ES-PRISm group was further divided into current smokers with PRISm and former smokers with PRISm, both these PRISm subtypes showed a faster annual lung function decline and a similarly higher risk of airflow limitation compared to the NS-PRISm group.
Interpretation
These findings suggest that both NS-PRISm and ES-PRISm may be potential precursors to COPD and indicate that PRISm should not be restricted to evaluating smokers alone.

AB  - Integrin is a large family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) which involves in the interaction of cells/cells and cells/ extracellular matrix (ECM) to mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, etc. In recent years, aberrant expression of integrin has been clearly found in many tumor studies, indicating that integrin is closely related to tumor formation and development. Meanwhile, it has effects on tumor cell differentiation, cell migration, proliferation and tumor neovascularization. The study of drugs targeting integrins is of great significance for the clinical treatment of tumors. Because of its important role in tumorigenesis and development, integrin has become a promising target for the treatment of cancer. This review summarizes the role of integrin in tumor development and the current state of integrin inhibitors to provide a valuable reference for subsequent research.

AB  - Accurate ship trajectory prediction (STP) is crucial to realise the early warning of ship collision and ensure maritime safety. Driven by advancements in artificial intelligence technology, deep learning-based STP has become a predominant approach in the research field of ship collision avoidance. This paper, based on a state-of-the-art survey of the existing STP research progress, aims to develop a new bi-directional information fusion-driven prediction model that enables the achievement of more accurate STP results by addressing the drawbacks of the classical methods in the field. In this context, a cascading network model is developed by combining two bi-directional networks in a specific order. It incorporates the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network into a single three-layer, information-enhanced network. It takes advantage of both networks to realise more accurate prediction of ship trajectories. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model is comprehensively evaluated using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from three water areas representing traffic scenarios of different safety concerns. The superiority of the proposed model is verified through comparative analysis with twenty other methods, including the state-of-the-art STP in the literature. The finding reveals that the new model is better than all the benchmarked ones, and thus, the new STP solution in this paper makes new contributions to improving autonomous navigation and maritime safety.

AB  - Software product line (SPL) scoping aids companies to define the boundaries of their resources such as products, domains, and assets, the target of reuse tasks scoping technical and organizational aspects. As scoping guides the management of the resources in SPL development, it becomes one of the core activities in this process. We can find in the literature several approaches on this topic, proposing techniques and methodologies to be applicable in different organizational scenarios. However, no work comprehensively reviews such approaches and describes the advances in state of the art in the last years. In this context, we look into identifying, analyzing, and extracting detailed characteristics from SPL scoping proposals found in the literature. These characteristics allowed us to compare these approaches, reason about their applicability, and identify existing limitations and research opportunities. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review alongside snowballing, following a well-defined protocol to retrieve, classify and extract information from the literature. We analyzed a total of 58 studies, identifying 41 different approaches in the field, highlighting their similarities and differences, and establishing a generic scoping process. Furthermore, we discuss research opportunities in the SPL scoping field.

AB  - Context:
Literature faces the lack of studies relating which characteristics of the Scrum framework are adapted. Understanding such variations is useful for prospective software development projects and guiding teams at conducting Scrum customizations.
Objective:
We aimed at identifying how the Scrum framework has been adapted to the context of Agile software development projects and how adaptations might be represented to aid researchers and practitioner at analyzing Scrum processes deployed or to be deployed.
Method:
We carried out a systematic mapping study in five electronic sources, 11 journals and 15 conferences/workshops. We submitted the 281 returned studies to various filters, which resulted in 50 studies with data extracted, analyzed, and quality evaluated.
Results:
SMS provides a panorama on the Scrum characteristics adapted to roles, events, and artifacts. We decided to adopt feature models for hierarchically accommodating found Scrum adaptations as it supports adaptations in the form of variability. We evaluated the resulting feature model with practitioners from different companies in the perspective of Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use considering the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Therefore, we demonstrated the produced feature model aids users to better visualize and understand the documented Scrum adaptations.
Conclusions:
The panorama on Scrum adaptations and the problems during Scrum adoption are discussed to providing a means to practically understand and tailor (configure) such adaptations. Such adaptations are an essential source of information on the variety of Scrum elements, thus researchers and practitioners may take the results of this work as a guide to understand how different adaptations occur in different contexts during software development. In addition, the conceived feature model is an important asset to guide such users at selecting Scrum characteristics and respective adaptations to perform. The feature model also promotes reuse of knowledge gathered up from several different information sources.

AB  - Context
There is abundant literature on the application of UML Use Cases. However, the impact that these applications have had on real projects (in industry) is not well known. It is necessary to know what the impact of the Use Cases really is, so that both, researchers and professionals can make the most pertinent decisions.
Objective
To identify and classify the positive and negative impacts of using Use Cases in real-world settings.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study. The search strategies retrieved a set of 4431 papers out of which 47 were selected as primary studies. We defined four facets to classify these studies: 1) the positive impact (advantages), 2) the negative impact (disadvantages), 3) the industry's domain and 4) the type of research reported.
Results
Our study identified eight categories of advantages related to the application of Use Cases. The most mentioned were estimation, analysis and automation. These advantages had a heterogeneous distribution along the years. On the other hand, the granularity of the scenarios described in the Use Cases, the lack of a standardized format for specifying requirements, and the lack of appropriate guidelines for analysing them were the most mentioned disadvantages. We identified a variety of industry domains, grouped into seven categories. As we can expect most of the papers report experiences in the Information Technology domain, followed by financials applications. Almost half the papers applied evaluation research, including an empirical validation. Only one third of the analysed papers reported threats to validity, the most mentioned being generalizability (38%).
Conclusions
Use Cases have proven to be a useful tool in software development, particularly during the early stages. The positive effects far outweigh the few negative effects reported, although this may be due to the researchers' tendency of not reporting negative results.

AB  - Summary
Background
In low malaria-endemic settings, screening and treatment of individuals in close proximity to index cases, also known as reactive case detection (RACD), is practised for surveillance and response. However, other approaches could be more effective for reducing transmission. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of reactive focal mass drug administration (rfMDA) and reactive focal vector control (RAVC) in the low malaria-endemic setting of Zambezi (Namibia).
Methods
We did a cluster-randomised controlled, open-label trial using a two-by-two factorial design of 56 enumeration area clusters in the low malaria-endemic setting of Zambezi (Namibia). We randomly assigned these clusters using restricted randomisation to four groups: RACD only, rfMDA only, RAVC plus RACD, or rfMDA plus RAVC. RACD involved rapid diagnostic testing and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and single-dose primaquine, rfMDA involved presumptive treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, and RAVC involved indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl. Interventions were administered within 500 m of index cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting the parasite reservoir in humans (rfMDA vs RACD), in mosquitoes (RAVC vs no RAVC), and in both humans and mosquitoes (rfMDA plus RAVC vs RACD only), an intention-to-treat analysis was done. For each of the three comparisons, the primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria cases. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02610400.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2017, 55 enumeration area clusters had 1118 eligible index cases that led to 342 interventions covering 8948 individuals. The cumulative incidence of locally acquired malaria was 30·8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 12·8–48·7) in the clusters that received rfMDA versus 38·3 per 1000 person-years (23·0–53·6) in the clusters that received RACD; 30·2 per 1000 person-years (15·0–45·5) in the clusters that received RAVC versus 38·9 per 1000 person-years (20·7–57·1) in the clusters that did not receive RAVC; and 25·0 per 1000 person-years (5·2–44·7) in the clusters that received rfMDA plus RAVC versus 41·4 per 1000 person-years (21·5–61·2) in the clusters that received RACD only. After adjusting for imbalances in baseline and implementation factors, the incidence of malaria was lower in clusters receiving rfMDA than in those receiving RACD (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0·52 [95% CI 0·16–0·88], p=0·009), lower in clusters receiving RAVC than in those that did not (0·48 [0·16–0·80], p=0·002), and lower in clusters that received rfMDA plus RAVC than in those receiving RACD only (0·26 [0·10–0·68], p=0·006). No serious adverse events were reported.
Interpretation
In a low malaria-endemic setting, rfMDA and RAVC, implemented alone and in combination, reduced malaria transmission and should be considered as alternatives to RACD for elimination of malaria.

AB  - This chapter reviews the global market of flexible plastic packaging and the markets of the main types of recycled film. Further, it investigates the main trends toward a sustainable and recyclable flexible packaging including redesign, increase collection, improve sorting, new recycling technologies (e.g., use of compatibilizers, solvent separation, and chemical recycling), alternative materials, such as bioplastics, the proposed measures to stimulate the market for recycled flexible packaging, and the four reuse models to reduce the need for single-use packaging. It also presents some ideas and proposals for future legislation and regulation. Finally, a summary of the major programs/projects and reports for the recycling of flexible plastic packaging is given.

AB  - Summary
Background and aims
Upadacitinib, an oral, reversible Janus kinase inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with Crohn’s disease in two phase 3 induction trials (U-EXCEL and U-EXCEED) and in a primary analysis of the first 502 patients entering the subsequent maintenance trial (U-ENDURE). Here, we present the overall results of the entire population of U-ENDURE (N = 673).
Methods
Clinical responders to 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) induction were randomized (1:1:1) to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 221), upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 229), or placebo (N = 223) as maintenance therapy for 52 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 52. Safety was assessed through week 52.
Results
At week 52, more upadacitinib-treated versus placebo patients achieved CDAI clinical remission (upadacitinib 15 mg, 36.2% and upadacitinib 30 mg, 51.5% versus placebo, 15.2%). The rates of endoscopic response were 27.3% for upadacitinib 15 mg and 40.7% for upadacitinib 30 mg vs 7.2% for placebo. Exposure-adjusted event rates for treatment-emergent adverse events were numerically lower with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg versus placebo (351.3 and 324.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively, versus 462.8 per 100 patient-years) except for COVID-19 and adverse events leading to early discontinuation of study treatment. No deaths, active tuberculosis, lymphoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, adjudicated major cardiovascular adverse events, or venous thromboembolic events were reported from any treatment group. Herpes zoster infections occurred more frequently in the upadacitinib groups compared to placebo; all were non-serious and most involved a single dermatome.
Conclusion
Consistent with the primary analysis, upadacitinib was more efficacious than placebo in achieving clinical and endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn’s disease. The safety profile remained consistent with no new safety signals. ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT03345823.
