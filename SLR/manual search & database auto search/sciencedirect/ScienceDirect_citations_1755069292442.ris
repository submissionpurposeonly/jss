AB  - Water splitting has been regarded as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly technique to realize green hydrogen generation, while more energy is consumed due to the high overpotentials required for the anode oxygen evolution reaction. Urea electrooxidation, an ideal substitute, is thus received increasing attention in assisting water-splitting reactions. Note that highly efficient catalysts are still required to drive urea oxidation, and the facile generation of high valence state species is significant in the reaction based on the electrochemical-chemical mechanisms. The high cost and rareness make the noble metal catalysts impossible for further consideration in large-scale application. Ni-based catalysts are very promising due to their cheap price, facile structure tuning, good compatibility, and easy active phase formation. In the light of the significant advances made recently, herein, we reviewed the recent advances of Ni-based powder catalysts for urea oxidation in assisting water-splitting reaction. The fundamental of urea oxidation is firstly presented to clarify the mechanism of urea-assisted water splitting, and then the prevailing evaluation indicators are briefly expressed based on the electrochemical measurements. The catalyst design principle including synergistic effect, electronic effect, defect construction and surface reconstruction as well as the main fabrication approaches are presented and the advances of various Ni-based powder catalysts for urea assisted water splitting are summarized and discussed. The problems and challenges are also concluded for the Ni-based powder catalysts fabrication, the performance evaluation, and their application. Considering the key influencing factors for catalytic process and their application, attention should be given to structure−property relationship deciphering, novel Ni-based powder catalysts development and their construction in the real device; specifically, the effort should be directed to the Ni-based powder catalyst with multi-functions to simultaneously promote the fundamental steps and high anti-corrosion ability by revealing the local structure reconstruction as well as the integration in the practical application. We believe the current summarization will be instructive and helpful for the Ni-based powder catalysts development and understanding their catalytic action for urea-assisted hydrogen generation via water splitting technique.

AB  - The rise of emerging mobility services (EMS), particularly ridehailing and micromobility, has transformed urban transportation and challenged the traditional public transit (PT) system. This has led to coopetition dynamics between EMS and PT, characterized by supplementary, complementary, and competitive interactions, which introduce complexity to discussions on equity, cost, and sustainability. The long-term impact will also depend on how EMS is integrated with existing PT and how cities manage these challenges. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic literature review of EMS and PT coopetition dynamics, focusing on the equity implications of accessibility. The findings reveal that ridehailing primarily competes with PT while complementing it during disruptions and in areas with limited service; however, it disproportionately benefits affluent areas, exacerbating inequities. Conversely, micromobility supplements PT as first- and last-mile solutions while also competing in city centers. This study also offers topology and pathways from coopetition to equitable EMS and PT integration.

AB  - Aim
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) constitutes a significant global health burden, with a survival rate of only 10–12%. Mobile phone technologies have been developed that crowdsource citizen volunteers to nearby OHCAs in order to initiate resuscitation prior to ambulance arrival. We performed a scoping review to map the available literature on these crowdsourcing technologies and compared their technical specifications.
Methods
A search strategy was developed for five online databases. Two reviewers independently assessed all articles for inclusion and extracted relevant study information. Subsequently, we performed a supplementary internet search and consulted experts to identify all available bystander alert technologies and their specifications.
Results
We included 65 articles examining bystander alerting technologies from more than 15 countries. We also identified 25 unique technologies, of which 18 were described in the included literature. Technologies were text message-based systems (n = 3) or mobile phone applications (n = 22). Most (21/25) used global positioning systems to direct bystanders to victims and nearby AEDs. Response radii for alerts varied widely from 200 m to 10 km. Some technologies incorporated advanced features such as video-conferencing with ambulance dispatch and detailed alert settings. Not all systems required volunteers to have training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Only ten studies assessed impact on clinical outcomes. Key barriers discussed included false positive alerts, legal liability, and potential psychological impact on volunteers.
Conclusion
Our review provides a comprehensive overview of crowdsourcing technologies for bystander intervention in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Future work should focus on clinical outcomes and methods of addressing barriers to implementation.

AB  - The electrification of heating, cooling, and transportation to reach decarbonization targets calls for a rapid expansion of renewable technologies. Due to their decentral and intermittent nature, these technologies require robust planning that considers non-technical constraints and flexibility options to be integrated effectively. Energy system models (ESMs) are frequently used to support decision-makers in this planning process. In this study, 116 case studies of local, integrated ESMs are systematically reviewed to identify best-practice approaches to model flexibility and address non-technical constraints. Within the sample, storage systems and sector coupling are the most common types of flexibility. Sector coupling with the transportation sector is rarely considered, specifically with electric vehicles even though they could be used for smart charging or vehicle-to-grid operation. Social aspects are generally either completely neglected or modeled exogenously. Lacking actor heterogeneity, which can lead to unstable results in optimization models, can be addressed through building-level information. A strong emphasis on cost is found and while emissions are also frequently reported, additional metrics such as imports or the share of renewable generation are nearly entirely absent. To guide future modeling, the paper concludes with a roadmap highlighting flexibility and robustness options that either represent low-hanging fruit or have a large impact on results.

A large number of systematic reviews (SRs) studies have been performed in the cloud computing field, demonstrating miscellaneous outcomes and utilizing different approaches. Accordingly, a meta-review of cloud SRs is needed to appraise the results of such studies and create an integrated understanding. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach
A tertiary study was conducted using a systematic method to analyze SRs including two stages: searching and screening the SRs and thematic synthesis of results. As a qualitative data management tool, Nvivo software was used to support the research process, for data coding and synthesis.
Findings
First, by searching electronic sources between the year of 2011–2016, out of a total of 142 identified articles, 94 articles were included according to pre-determined criteria, of which 76 articles were approved after qualitative evaluation. In the second stage, identifying the research themes, a map of the concepts and issues related to each theme was drawn up. The analysis shows that the quality of articles has improved but can be further enhanced using methodological guidelines as well as supporting tools. The research has focused more on the technical aspect, although there is an equal demand for synthesizing of cloud governance concepts.
Originality/value
This is the first tertiary study which presents the main research themes and concepts of cloud SRs in form of thematic maps by using the thematic synthesis and SR methods. This paper also provides some recommendations to improve reviews after evaluating the quality of papers. This study can support reviewers for future SRs in the field and also helps practitioners and managers to have a better understanding of different aspects of cloud computing.

AB  - Single-case experimental designs (SCED) are experimental designs aiming at testing the effect of an intervention using a small number of patients (typically one to three), using repeated measurements, sequential (±randomized) introduction of an intervention and method-specific data analysis, including visual analysis and specific statistics. The aim of this paper is to familiarise professionals working in different fields of rehabilitation with SCEDs and provide practical advice on how to design and implement a SCED in clinical rehabilitation practice. Research questions suitable for SCEDs and the different types of SCEDs (e.g., alternating treatment designs, introduction/withdrawal designs and multiple baseline designs) are reviewed. Practical steps in preparing a SCED design are outlined. Examples from different rehabilitation domains are provided throughout the paper. Challenging issues such as the choice of the repeated measure, assessment of generalisation, randomization, procedural fidelity, replication and generalizability of findings are discussed. Simple rules and resources for data analysis are presented. The utility of SCEDs in physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) are discussed.

AB  - Many zero-deforestation commitments pledge to enhance social sustainability in commodity supply chains. We review zero-deforestation commitments, and the peer-reviewed and gray literature, to characterize the role of these commitments in protecting and enhancing the well-being of indigenous and traditional forest-dependent people, laborers, and smallholders. First, we find that social criteria in zero-deforestation commitments pertain to labor standards, land rights, and community consultation. Second, we find that few publications examine the impacts of zero-deforestation commitments on social outcomes. Of those few, most are gray literature reports that rely on field-intensive data-collection to evaluate compliance with social criteria. Third, we highlight opportunities for linking zero-deforestation commitments to certification programs, and for developing jurisdictional approaches to sustainable sourcing. Finally, we call for more research to better-understand the social dimensions of zero-deforestation commitments.

AB  - Background: Demand forecasting is the area of predictive analytics devoted to predicting future volumes of services or consumables. Fair understanding and estimation of how demand will vary facilitates the optimal utilization of resources. In a medical laboratory, accurate forecasting of future demand, that is, test volumes, can increase efficiency and facilitate long-term laboratory planning. Importantly, in an era of utilization management initiatives, accurately predicted volumes compared to the realized test volumes can form a precise way to evaluate utilization management initiatives. Laboratory test volumes are often highly amenable to forecasting by time-series models; however, the statistical software needed to do this is generally either expensive or highly technical. Method: In this paper, we describe an open-source web-based software tool for time-series forecasting and explain how to use it as a demand forecasting tool in clinical laboratories to estimate test volumes. Results: This tool has three different models, that is, Holt-Winters multiplicative, Holt-Winters additive, and simple linear regression. Moreover, these models are ranked and the best one is highlighted. Conclusion: This tool will allow anyone with historic test volume data to model future demand.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Activity-based costing system, commonly known as the ABC system, emerged as a costing method capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional costing systems in face of economic and technological developments, namely, the arbitrary and imprecise allocation of indirect costs from distortions in the imputation criteria. In the current context, the development of an adequate costing system is of extreme importance in organisations because they feel the need to properly manage the resources at their disposal and control their costs to achieve efficient and effective management. Thus, this study aims to analyse international publications on the activity-based costing system in recent years, identifying trends in evolution and future research opportunities. Based on bibliometric techniques, the outputs obtained in the Web of Science (n = 752) and Scopus (n = 1107) databases were analysed in bibliometrix R package to make a systematic mapping and review of the literature. After removing duplicates, we obtained a final output of 1419 articles. The analysis of these publications points to a growing trend in the publication of articles on ABC, highlighting publications in partnership and their dispersion in magazines from different areas. The bibliometric analysis carried out results on the authors’ global research performance over time, and we highlighted the pioneering publications every five years and analysed the general evolution. When analysing based on publication authors over time, we highlighted the main research themes and countries where studies had been carried out. On the other hand, we also highlighted the collaborative network between institutions, authors, and countries over time.

AB  - Goal
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has begun to play a significant role in the field of medical devices. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview and classification of additively manufactured medical instruments for diagnostics and surgery by identifying medical and technical aspects.
Methods
A scientific literature search on additively manufactured medical instruments was conducted using the Scopus database.
Results
We categorized the relevant articles (71) by considering the novelty of each proposed instrument and its clinical application. Then, we analyzed the relevant articles by examining the reasons behind choosing additive manufacturing technology to produce instruments for diagnostics and surgery. Possible customization (27%) and Cost-effectiveness (23%) were the main reasons expressed. Technical specifications of the additive manufacturing technology and the material used were also analyzed, and a tendency of using material extrusion technology (35% of the applications) and polymeric materials (86% of the applications) was shown.
Conclusions
Additive manufacturing is opening the door to a new approach in the production of medical devices, which allows the complexity of their designs to be pushed to the extreme. However, we found that technical limitations need to be tackled and important aspects such as sterilization or debris contamination are still not considered to be relevant factors during the design and fabrication process. Keeping in mind the challenges of such a new field, additive manufacturing technology can be considered as a great opportunity to provide easy access to healthcare in developing countries as well as an important step toward patient-specific medicine.

AB  - In the current automotive industry, human operators perform wire harness assembly manually, which causes significant quality, productivity, safety, and ergonomic problems. Robotic assembly is a critical facilitator in addressing these problems. However, it remains challenging to implement for robotizing the assembly of wire harnesses. Wire harness assembly is a specific scenario of deformable linear object manipulation. Robotizing this assembly task demands robots to flexibly adapt their actions to the dynamically changing industrial environment based on robotic perception results. Existing research suggested the significance of robotic visual perception in the robotic assembly of wire harnesses. Implementing computer vision techniques is fundamental to enabling robots’ visual perception capabilities. Nonetheless, the industry has yet to introduce vision–based solutions to robotize wire harness assembly fully or partially. Through a systematic literature review, this article identifies fifteen scientific publications in vision–based robotized wire harness assembly. The results show various computer vision applications regarding wire harness components and assembly operations studied in previous research. Nevertheless, this article recognizes two significant challenges for computer vision applications in robotized wire harness assembly: (1) fulfilling production requirements on robustness and practicality and (2) exploiting the intrinsic physical features of wire harnesses for visual recognition. This article also advocated five prospective research directions toward more efficient and practical vision-based robotized wire harness assembly: (1) developing learning-based vision systems to exploit intrinsic features and multi–modality data of wire harnesses; (2) adapting vision systems proposed for robotizing assembly operations in manufacturing wire harnesses; (3) assessing the practicality, robustness, reliability, and sustainability of vision systems; (4) inquiring vision–based human–robot collaboration; and (5) exploring new product designs for facilitating visual recognition.

KW  - Safe pv installation
AB  - Numerous photovoltaic (PV) fire incidents are caused by overheating of PV system components, direct current (DC) arc-fault or hot spot phenomenon. These causes happen mainly due to poor installation practices by the installers. Many PV system installation guides do not emphasise much on the fire hazard during installation. As the PV system is becoming increasingly popular nowadays, it is crucial to establish a specific and comprehensive guideline pertaining to fire safe installation of the system. Therefore, this paper aims to assess and incorporate such fire safety practices from all PV installation guidelines that are publicly accessible. A total of 40 PV installation publications have been systematically reviewed and classified into two categories – design consideration and installation stage. The analysis pointed out a compilation of fire safety practices during PV system installation focusing on residential rooftop applications from the reviewed publications. Although DC isolators have been reported as the top component of PV fire causes, many guidelines do not emphasise the fire hazards involved as well as the things that should and should not be done during installation. The inclusion of a fire safety checklist is suggested as part of the installation guideline.

AB  - Power supply played a critical role during the COVID-19 pandemic in keeping hospitals and critical medical equipment operating, which was quickly reflected in electricity consumption and new consumption patterns. However, not all countries faced the same challenges. While developed countries could react adequately to changes in hospital electricity consumption patterns, low-income countries faced infrastructure and energy access challenges during the pandemic, which hampered the management of the pandemic in all of its dimensions. This paper reviews the importance of power supply in hospitals through a literature review and divides the discussion into three sections. First, the factors influencing new hospital consumption patterns during the pandemic are discussed. Then, the consequences of the lack of electricity in remote areas on managing the pandemic are reviewed. Finally, the impact of the pandemic on the design of hybrid power generation systems is reviewed, which must not only provide autonomy for similar future scenarios but also be prepared to respond to sudden increases in power consumption due to a greater number of patients or longer working hours, an increase in the number of critical loads, and possible restrictions on access to fuel. Thus, this work provides valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and researchers on the importance of updating hospital power supply standards and contributes to demonstrating the need to electrify remote hospitals.

AB  - An axiom of lithium-ion batteries is that they operate safely at about the same temperature range in which humans are comfortable. They can operate at both high and low temperatures, but this can cause performance limitations and create safety issues. Frequently operating an energy storage system at high temperatures can significantly reduce the operating life of the battery. Ensuring the life and safety of the lithium-ion battery system is one of the most important jobs of the battery system and is managed by the thermal management system (TMS). The TMS can be based on liquid, air, or other cooling and heating mediums and includes a heat exchanger connected to the lithium-ion cells to remove excess heat generated during operations, a series of ductwork or hoses to move cooling of the medium through the pack, and connectors to the external system, where the heated mediums are cooled and then recirculated back into the battery.

AB  - Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is the terminology applied where the actions of microorganisms influence the corrosion process. In literature, terms such as microbial corrosion, biocorrosion, microbially influenced/induced corrosion, and biodegradation are often applied. MIC research in the oil and gas industry has seen a revolution over the past decade, with the introduction of molecular microbiological methods: (MMM) as well as new industry standards and procedures of sampling biofilm and corrosion products from the process system. This review aims to capture the most important trends the oil and gas industry has seen regarding MIC research over the past decade. The paper starts out with an overview of where in the process stream MIC occurs − from the oil reservoir to the consumer. Both biotic and abiotic corrosion mechanisms are explained in the context of managing MIC using a structured corrosion management (CM) approach. The corrosion management approach employs the elements of a management system to ensure that essential corrosion control activities are carried out in an effective, sustainable, well-planned and properly executed manner. The 3-phase corrosion management approach covering of both biotic and abiotic internal corrosion mechanisms consists of 1) corrosion assessment, 2) corrosion mitigation and 3) corrosion monitoring. Each of the three phases are described in detail with links to recent field cases, methods, industry standards and sampling protocols. In order to manage the corrosion threat, operators commonly use models to support decision making. The models use qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative measures to help assess the rate of degradation caused by MIC. The paper reviews four existing models for MIC Threat Assessment and describe a new model that links the threat of MIC in the oil processing system located on an offshore platform with a Risk Based Inspection (RBI) approach. A recent field case highlights and explains the conflicting historic results obtained through serial dilution of culture media using the most probable number (MPN) method as compared to data obtained from corrosion monitoring and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. Results from qPCR application in the field case have changed the way MIC is monitored on the oil production facility in the North Sea. A number of high quality resources have been published as technical conference papers, books, educational videos and peer-reviewed scientific papers, and thus we end the review with an updated list of state-of-the-art resources for anyone desiring to become more familiar with the topic of MIC in the upstream oil and gas sector.

AB  - The Baltic region relies heavily on imported fossil fuels and strongly emphasizes renewable energy development. However, certain obstacles, such as site selection, hinder solar energy development in this region. Therefore, major energy stakeholders must identify optimal solar photovoltaic construction locations. The present study endeavored to conduct a comprehensive and meticulous review of pertinent literature published from 2013 to 2023 to identify critical factors that influence site selection and look into various methodologies employed in this domain. Later, a two-stage approach was used for the first time to identify the most suitable locations among 39 potential cities in the Baltic region for constructing solar PV farms. In the first stage, Data envelopment analysis (DEA) models were used to filter out the areas with the highest potential by measuring their efficiency indices using temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and air pressure as inputs and sunshine hours, elevation, and irradiation as outputs. Subsequently, six selected evaluation criteria were used to prioritize the locations with solar energy potential. In the second stage, CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC)-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to determine the criteria's objective weights and rank potential sites for the research case study. The results indicate that 25 locations in the Baltic region are suitable for building solar farms, with specific photovoltaic power output being the most significant criterion that impacts solar site selection. Furthermore, by excluding Gross domestic product (GDP) and labor force from the analysis, the results can align with the Global Solar Atlas's reports.

This paper aims to examine how companies enact traceability in their global supply chains (SCs) to achieve sustainability goals and how this so-called traceability for sustainability (TfS) can contribute to (sustainable) supply chain management ([S]SCM). For this, the paper focuses on the paramount example of the apparel industry.
Design/methodology/approach
This study presents an integrative and systematic literature review of 89 peer-reviewed journal articles on the confluence of traceability and sustainability in global apparel SCs. It comprises content analysis and abductive category-building based on previous literature.
Findings
A conceptual framework emerges to describe TfS as an evolving cycle, comprising three dimensions: governance, collaboration and tracking and tracing. Resources and capabilities literature set the foundations for conceiving TfS as a distinctive meta-capability construct. Hence, besides being associated to increased performance, risk management and SC process transformation, TfS ultimately blurs boundaries and integrates non-traditional SC actors into the same ecosystem with important implications for sustainability and (S)SCM. This study refers to the industrial upgrading potential of global SCs to explain how leveraging enabling technologies for TfS may help to improve the triple-bottom-line (TBL) performance of the actors in the broad ecosystem while reducing the risks associated to those technologies. Thus, TfS can contribute to (S)SCM and to TBL sustainability within and beyond SC boundaries.
Originality/value
This study conceptually frames (S)SCM exploring TfS as a meta-capability and contributes to the underexplored question of how to achieve sustainability in global SCs.

AB  - Smart healthcare is a framework that utilizes technologies such as wearable devices, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and wireless communication technology to seamlessly access health records, link individuals, resources, and organizations, and then effectively handle and react to health environment demands intelligently. One of the main ingredients of smart healthcare is medical sensors or IoMT. Due to the complex nature of diseases, in many cases, there is a need for multimodal medical signals for their diagnoses. While using multimodal signals, the most important issue is how to fuse them – an area of burgeoning interest within the research community. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of multimodal medical signals fusion schemes that have been proposed for smart healthcare applications. Research works included in major repositories, such as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer Link, and ACM digital library have been surveyed to address several related research questions. Focus is placed on recent developments, thus only works published between 2014-2020 are considered. Finally, key research challenges and possible future directions are also provided.

AB  - The Polish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Baltic Sea is an area of increasing strategic importance for Poland's pursuit of renewable energy, especially offshore wind. This research investigates the complementarity among solar, wind, and wave energy resources within the Polish EEZ to examine these energy sources' temporal dynamics, correlations, and extremes. The primary data source corresponds to a 31-year hourly time series dataset from the ERA5 reanalysis, whose reliability was evaluated through performance metrics. The results from complementarity metrics indicate varying levels of association among the three variable renewable energy resources (VRES) in the EEZ, spanning from weak similarity to weak complementarity. The findings of this research indicate that blackouts are most probable at offshore locations during winter and autumn for renewable power systems integrating wind and solar energy, with over 70 % of occurrences within these seasons. The investigation of extreme events highlights critical elements when evaluating VRES and their complementarity. This understanding aids in effectively planning and managing renewable energy systems, ensuring resilience and reliability under challenging weather conditions. Furthermore, while the complementarity may be consistent throughout the entire Polish EEZ, the feasibility and cost of implementing hybrid power systems can significantly vary between locations.

AB  - Oil and gas (O&G) facilities often pose significant hazards to personnel, regardless whether they are located onshore or offshore. This leads to the necessity for human factors engineering (HFE), which addresses the hazard risks associated with the consequences of human errors. It also improves the operability, maintainability and user acceptance of the facilities or equipment in a holistic manner. Major players in the O&G industry recognise that HFE plays a significant role in ensuring the quality, safety and fitness for purpose of the equipment and facilities utilised. Notwithstanding its importance, neither its implementation in the global offshore O&G industry has been consistent nor has it been structurally and seamlessly deployed within the framework of facilities design and development. Thus, this paper aimed to provide some initial insights into the current state of HFE implementation in the global offshore O&G industry. This included a brief description of its multidisciplinary facets and intent within the sector, while current HFE practices, experiences, lessons learned and its role in the context of facilities development were reviewed and summarised accordingly. Furthermore, this paper would be a good starting point for organisations and design practitioners during implementation of HFE in a facility development project and to consider the accumulated past experiences to date in an efficient manner; resulting in better design outcomes.

AB  - The introduction of assembly lines in industrial plants marked the beginning of the third industrial revolution. The support of information technology has enabled continuous progresses, up to the digitalisation of the processes. In this context, the further innovation characterised by the introduction of Cyber-Physical Systems and other enabling technologies has allowed the fourth industrial revolution. Proposed by the German government, Industry 4.0 appealed to both researchers and practitioners. Since the appearance of the term Industry 4.0, the linked-term Industrial Internet has been introduced to indicate the technology stack and knowledge management required by Industry 4.0. Industrial Internet makes a factory smart by applying advanced information and communication systems and future-oriented technologies, as well as new principles of knowledge management. Undeniably, such a system introduces greater complexity in terms of technologies, knowledge and socio-cultural aspects. Companies are often unprepared to deal with innovation issues, because they lack knowledge and competences and they are not culturally prepared for the relative novelties, but especially because they lack the necessary technological pre-requisites to develop the appropriate technology stack. From this perspective, different models of maturity have been developed, both in academic and technical environments, to support companies in understanding their position within the paradigm of the Industrial Internet. Starting from a quantitative review of the maturity models designed in the general literature, this article develops a qualitative review of the models applied in Industry 4.0, characterising all relevant models and proposing future perspectives to improve existing models and develop new ones.

AB  - Mobile robots in nuclear (MRiN) has become a multidisciplinary research field that integrates numerous technologies (e.g., nuclear technology, robotic, advanced material, artificial intelligence and construction), resulting in fragmented yet extensive related literatures. In this paper, a hybrid methodology combining bibliometric analysis with qualitative discussion is proposed to explore the advancements in MRiN over the past two decades. Four research hotspots, namely design, protection, perception and planning, are identified through quantitative bibliometric analysis employing data statistics and cluster analysis. Subsequent the qualitative discussions of the four hotspots highlight recent achievements and reveal research gaps in MRiN. Furthermore, five future research directions are proposed: 1) in-depth integration of radiation information, building information modeling (BIM), with robotics; 2) novel approaches for locating radioactive sources in complex environments; 3) multi-objective optimization of shielding structures for sensitive components; 4) advanced multi-robot collaboration for concurrent operations; 5) immersive digital twin (DT) technology combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for MRiN operations. By identifying current research themes and technological trends in nuclear robotics, while providing strategic insights for MRiN's future development, this research can serve both academia and industry in terms of promoting robotics technology and computer science in nuclear industry.

AB  - The primary cause of machinery space fires is cited as the release of flammable oil mist contacting unprotected hot surfaces. With this being common knowledge why do we continue to see this type of incident reoccurring on ships carrying thousands of passengers to precarious destinations? We review regulatory and Class requirements with respect to fire safety, Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) as a rule-making instrument of the IMO, accident investigation recommendations involving fire, fire safety technology, and research literature. For each constituent of fire safety control, the paper aims to determine the preferred strategies for accident prevention and their relative cost effectiveness. Subsequently, the cost effectiveness of the current safety approach is established. This review found that fire prevention could be made more cost effective if its scope was broadened beyond the detection of proximate events occurring immediately before ignition. The findings suggest that more cost-effective safety measures can be developed by addressing systemic causes of fire. Removal of the systemic causal factors of fire from the equation, means we can address fire safety prior to the moments before ignition when the point of no return can unwittingly be passed. The paper suggests directions of how this can be achieved.

AB  - Robustness of production systems is a popular research topic that comes in many facets. However, apart from a few case studies, not much is known about what robustness actually means in practice. Therefore, this study analyzes how practitioners deal with robustness. The data is based on a fairly representative survey of the German manufacturing industry. Amongst others, it is shown what practitioners understand by robustness, how they assess it, and which measures they consider as suitable to improve it. The results not only allow practitioners to compare their own status with industry’s best practices, but also suggest further researcher areas.

AB  - Our modern lifestyle has been populated with many devices and services that make use of Artificial intelligence (AI) to improve their performance and satisfy our daily needs. Machine learning (ML), an applied subcategory of AI, allows machines to autonomously extract knowledge from data and learn from it. However, the increased popularity of the use of these technologies has made them a target of malicious parties who aim to impair the performance of ML-based systems by modifying either the training or the test data. This chapter first describes the threat landscape and explains how such attacks operate, and then leverages four representative case studies, namely Tweets classification, malicious URL detection, Internet of Things (IoT) intrusion detection and financial forecast, to demonstrate how adversarial attacks against ML-based systems can materialize and what their impact is.

AB  - Future 100% renewable energy systems will have to integrate different sectors, including provision of power, heating, cooling and transport. Such energy systems will be needed to mitigate the negative impacts of economic development based on the use of fossil fuels, but will rely on variable renewable energy resources. As two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to fossil fuel combustion, decarbonization of energy systems is imperative for combating the climate change. Integrating future energy systems with CO2 capture and utilization technologies can contribute to deep decarbonization. As these technologies can be operated flexibly, they can be used to balance the grid to allow for high levels of variable renewable energy in the power mix. The captured CO2 can be either utilized as a feedstock for various value-added applications in the chemical industry and related sectors such as the food and beverage industries. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on CO2 capture and utilization technologies, with an emphasis on their potential integration into a low-carbon, high-renewables penetration grid. The potential market size for CO2 as raw material is also elaborated and discussed. The review paper provides an insight to the development and the technological needs of different energy system sectors, as well the limitations, challenges and research gaps to the integration of the variable renewable energy sources and flexible carbon capture and utilization technologies.

AB  - With the fast progress in information technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), smart healthcare has gained considerable momentum. By using advanced technologies like AI, smart healthcare aims to promote human beings’ health and well-being throughout their life. As smart healthcare develops, big healthcare data are produced by various sensors, devices, and communication technologies constantly. To deal with these big multi-source data, automatic information fusion becomes crucial. Information fusion refers to the integration of multiple information sources for obtaining more reliable, effective, and precise information to support optimal decision-making. The close study of information fusion for healthcare with the adoption of advanced AI technologies has become an increasingly important and active field of research. The aim of this is to present a systematic description and state-of-the-art understanding of research about information fusion for healthcare with AI. Structural topic modeling was implemented to detect major research topics covered within 351 relevant articles. Annual trends and correlations of the identified topics were also investigated to identify potential future research directions. In addition, the primary research concerns of top countries/regions, institutions, and authors were shown and compared. The findings based on our analyses provide scientific and technological perspectives of research on information fusion for smart health with AI and offer useful insights and implications for its future development. We also provide valuable guidance for researchers and project managers to allocate research resources and promote effective international collaborations.

AB  - Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) has been perceived as a promising technology for biomass and waste conversion due to its distinctive features, including fast, even, and precise heating. This results in higher energy efficiency when compared to conventional pyrolysis via thermal heating. However, the scaling up of MAP of biomass and waste poses challenges, with investigations ongoing to uncover not only the technological aspect, but also both the environmental impacts and economic feasibility associated with this process/technology. The possible environmental impacts associated with MAP processes can be analyzed through systematic life-cycle assessment (LCA), while the economic feasibility can be evaluated via techno-economic analysis (TEA). This paper presents an overview of the current research trend in MAP and the products produced, as well as the LCA and TEA of the pyrolysis technologies. The LCA study reported a 2.5 folds reduction in energy consumption and up to 62% reduction in global warming potential. TEA study revealed that conventional pyrolysis has a greater profit for long-term assessment due to a higher maturity and less complexity technology; however, MAP may be more economically feasible in the future owing to the increased maturity and more established technology. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for LCA and TEA in MAP are elucidated.

AB  - As the most significant carbon sink on Earth, the ocean has been inevitably absorbing excess atmospheric CO2, leading to high concentration of CO2 that threatens marine life. Like emissions of greenhouse gases, this issue demands urgent attention. Hence, comprehensive investigation and comparison, including both non-electrochemical and electrochemical direct ocean capture (DOC) methods, are revealed in this review. The non-electrochemical approach utilizes specialized materials such as gas-permeable membranes (GPM), hollow fiber membrane contactors (HFMC), and ion exchange resins to extract CO2 from seawater. In contrast, the electrochemical method employs chemical reactions to generate H+ or OH− ions, which adjust the pH value of seawater to either release CO2 gas or precipitate carbonate, thereby removing dissolved carbon. This article comprehensively overviews each method, including the latest research findings, underlying principles, employed equipment, and performance metrics. Finally, the achievements, current gaps, corresponding perspectives, and potential solutions in CO2 capture from seawater are also proposed.

AB  - Microplastic pollution is becoming a global challenge due to its long-term accumulation in the environment, causing adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. Sludge discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a critical role as a carrier and primary source of environmental microplastic contamination. A significantly average microplastic variation between 1000 and 301,400 particles kg−1 has been reported in the sludge samples. In recent years, advanced technologies have been successfully applied to address this issue, including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Adsorption technologies are essential to utilizing novel adsorbents (e.g., biochar, graphene, zeolites) for effectively removing MPs. Especially, the removal efficiency of polymer microspheres from an aqueous solution by Mg/Zn modified magnetic biochars (Mg/Zn-MBC) was obtained at more than 95%. Also, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely applied to degrade microplastic contaminants, in which photocatalytic by semiconductors (e.g., TiO2 and ZnO) is a highly suitable approach to promote the degradation reactions owing to strongly hydroxyl radicals (OH*). Biological degradation-aided microorganisms (e.g., bacterial and fungal strains) have been reported to be suitable for removing microplastics. Yet, it was affected by biotic and abiotic factors of the environmental conditions (e.g., pH, light, temperature, moisture, bio-surfactants, microorganisms, enzymes) as well as their polymer characteristics, i.e., molecular weight, functional groups, and crystallinity. Notably, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) showed the highest efficiency in removing up to 99% microplastic particles and minimizing their contamination in sewage sludge. Further, MBRs illustrate the suitability for treating high-strength compounds, e.g., polymer debris and microplastic fibers from complex industrial wastewater. Finally, this study provided a comprehensive understanding of potential adverse risks, transportation pathways, and removal mechanisms of microplastic, which full-filled the knowledge gaps in this field.

The subject of this paper is wearable computing technology. The purpose of this paper is to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of both users and librarians. The specific goals include: description of the main features of wearable computing from the perspective of its potential usefulness in libraries; analysis of areas of wearable computing use in public institutions; discussion of the potential of wearable computing for library users; and discussion of the potential of wearable computing for librarians to determine its potential in libraries to meet the needs of users and librarians.
Design/methodology/approach
The method of subject literature overview was used. The state of research from the period 2008 to 2018 on the use of wearable computing in libraries was established based on a search of selected sources Web of Science, Scopus, Elsevier and Emerald databases and LISTA database.
Findings
Wearable computing can be used in many areas of library activities to serve the needs of users and librarians. In the context of services for users, wearable computing can be used, among others, to help users navigate the library, to provide resources in new and interesting forms, and in education and entertainment. For the needs of librarians, additional data provided via wearable devices can accelerate the process of cataloguing resources and increase motivation to work via gamification options and features that make it possible to measure personal work efficiency. Librarians can also use the data obtained wearable computing devices to more quickly track, identify, select and organize resources. As with users, librarians can also use wearable computing in their education.
Research limitations/implications
The paper is a viewpoint based on subject literature. It presents only a sketch of potential wearable computing applications in libraries. The aim of the paper is to initiate further discussion on the possibilities of using wearable devices to improve both services for users and internal library processes. The author’s hope is that the concepts presented here will be tested in practice by librarians, which will allow further development of research on this subject.
Practical implications
The results can be widely used in practice as a framework for the implementation of wearable computing solutions in libraries.
Social implications
The paper can help to facilitate the debate on the role of the implementation of new technologies in libraries.
Originality/value
The issue of the use of wearable computing has not yet been widely discussed in library and information science journals. In the very few publications on similar topics, only the perspective on the application of new solutions in services for users is presented. This paper also shows the potential for improving libraries’ internal processes with the use of wearable computing.

AB  - Industrial device scanners allow anyone to scan devices on private networks and the Internet. They were intended as network security tools, but they are commonly exploited as attack tools, as scanning can reveal vulnerable devices. However, from a defensive perspective, this vulnerability disclosure could be used to secure devices if characteristics such as type, model, manufacturer, and firmware could be identified. Automated scanning reports can help to apply security measures before an attacker finds a vulnerability. A complete device recognition procedure can then be seen as the basis for auditing networks and identifying vulnerabilities to mitigate cyber-attacks, especially among Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices that are part of critical systems. In this survey, considering SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems as monitoring and control components of essential infrastructure, we focus on analyzing the architectures, specifications, and constraints of several industrial device scanners. In addition, we examine the information revealed by the scanners to identify the threats posed by them on industrial systems and networks. We analyze monthly and yearly statistics of cyber-attack incidents to investigate the role of these scanners in accelerating attacks. By presenting the findings of an experimentation, we highlight how easily anyone could identify hundreds of Internet-connected industrial devices in Sweden, which could lead to a major service interruption in industrial environments designed for minimal human involvement. We also discuss several methods to avoid scanners or reduce their identifying capabilities to conceal industrial devices from unauthorized access.

This study aims to shed light on what the main current blockchain applications in SCM are, what the main disruptions and challenges are in SCM because of blockchain adoption and what the future of blockchains holds in SCM.
Design/methodology/approach
This study followed the systematic review approach to analyse and synthesise the extant literature on blockchain–SCM integration. The review analysed 27 papers between 2008 and 2018 in peer-reviewed journals.
Findings
Blockchain–SCM integration is still in its infancy. Scholars and practitioners are not fully aware of the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional business models. However, the electric power industry seems to have a relatively mature understanding of blockchain–SCM integration, demonstrated by the use of smart contracts. Additionally, the disintermediation provided by blockchain applications has the potential to disrupt traditional industries (e.g. health care, transportation and retail).
Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this study are represented mainly by the scarcity of studies on blockchain–SCM integration in leading journals and databases.
Practical implications
This study highlights examples of blockchain–SCM integration, emphasising the need to rethink business models to incorporate blockchain technology.
Originality/value
This study is the first attempt to synthesise existing publications about the blockchain–SCM integration, shedding light on the disruption caused by, and the necessity of, the SCM reconfigurations.

Automatic and autonomous scheduling management can be encouraged by promoting the elimination of disruptions due to the appearance of defects, regardless of their origin. Hence the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model oriented towards zero-disturbance and zero-disruption objectives has barely been studied. Both strategies combine the optimisation of production processes by implementing DTs and promoting ZDM objectives to facilitate the modelling of automatic and autonomous scheduling systems. In this context, this particular vision of the scheduling process is called smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS). The aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on the scheduling problem that considers the DT technology approach and the ZDM model to achieve self-management and reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention. Specifically, 68 research articles were identified and analysed. The main results of this paper are to: (i) find methodological trends to approach SMS models, where three trends were identified; i.e. using DT technology and the ZDM model, utilising other enabling digital technologies and incorporating inherent SMS capabilities into scheduling; (ii) present the main SMS alignment axes of each methodological trend; (iii) provide a map to classify the literature that comes the closest to the SMS concept; (iv) discuss the main findings and research gaps identified by this study. Finally, managerial implications and opportunities for further research are identified.

AB  - Blood centers and hospital blood banks are regulated as medical laboratories and therefore must be in compliance with state and federal requirements. In this chapter, we identify the regulatory agencies that provide this oversight and review key regulatory concepts including inspections, proficiency testing, licensure and registration, complexity of laboratory testing, deviations and recalls, and quality assurance of blood products. By presenting hypothetical examples from clinical practice, we illustrate these important concepts related to quality and also introduce concepts related to disaster management.

AB  - Technological advancements such as information and communication technologies (ICTs), artificial intelligence (AI), internet-of-things (IoT), and the increasing popularity of the smart city and smart living movements during the last couple of decades boosted the developments in the smart home domain. Although the number of smart home related research has been expanding rapidly, there is still a lack of systematic analysis of the evolution of this research domain. This study helps to generate an understanding of the historical vicissitude, state-of-the-art and emerging trends, and the existing smart home research clusters. The study applies a scientometric method to analyse the published scholarly research (n = 17,153) over the last two decades, from 2000 to 2021. The scientometric analysis findings reveal that: Smart home literature has experienced steady growth during the last two decades; Smart home research has mainly clustered around ICT for home automation, home information management, AI for home automation, domestic energy management, IoT for home automation, and home-based healthcare areas; IoT is seen as the most popular technology to realise fully functioning smart homes; Limited evidence exists on the urban perspective and social issues of smart home technology; Smart homes are seen potentially as a strong driver of the smart city agenda.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to address indoor fire hazards in smart buildings. This study conducted a systematic review of 54 articles from interdisciplinary databases using selected keywords over the past decade, with the aim of investigating the potential role of IoT sensors in indoor fire hazard contingency. Through thematic analysis, five main themes and 24 sub-themes were identified, including vision-based sensing, smart automation, evacuation and indoor navigation, early fire detection, intervention and prevention, and BIM-related. The results of this review indicate that there are numerous aspects of indoor fire hazards that could benefit from the use of IoT sensors, and that the recurrence of technical terminologies in the analysed articles underscores the importance of these technologies in establishing an IoT sensor network in smart building environments, particularly in addressing indoor fire incidents. The outcome and findings spurred a concept for potential future research ideas. As a result of the findings, a conceptual framework for IoT sensors in the context of smart buildings is proposed.

AB  - High temperatures can reduce battery life and possibly result in thermal runaway, so controlling the battery pack operation temperature is important for electric vehicle's performance as well as safety. This is accomplished with the help of a battery thermal management system (BTMS). In this study, a detailed review of different strategies that has been used to optimize and enhance different BTMSs has been conducted using a combination of the conventional and bibliometric approaches. Based on the analysis of the literature, it was found that several researchers in recent times have conducted studies that investigated creative design approaches, computational methods, optimal cooling, and structural improvements to improve battery performance, safety, and service life. Among the methods and materials employed in the various studies are genetic algorithms, mini-channels, composite phase change materials, orthogonal testing, nanofluids, and surrogate modeling. The study also discovered that while air-cooled BTMS provides simplicity, safety, and consistency, its use is restricted to low-capacity batteries due to its lower heat capacity. Although it needs a sealing cover to stop leaks, liquid-cooled BTMS was found to be promising. Additionally, liquid metals and nanofluids are also being explored due to their increased heat conductivity. The study also identified the limitations associated with the various cooling mechanisms. Some future research proposals were made including the need to improve thermal performance in real-time energy storage systems by combining artificial intelligence and passive cooling techniques with cutting-edge composite materials and hydrated salts.

AB  - The growing need for sustainable waste management, especially for electronic waste (e-waste), has gained attention due to its environmental and economic implications. Despite the technological evolution of electronic products, their short lifespan and frequent replacement have led to a surge in discarded equipment. In particular, e-waste is rich in valuable materials, often exceeding natural ores. The challenge lies in the recycling of complex products, such as electrical or mechatronic systems, which consist of different materials. In addition, many of these discarded products are shipped to low-cost countries, leading to environmental concerns and health risks for workers. This paper explores the potential of automating the recycling process to address these challenges. This systematic literature review examines the emerging field of automated recycling for electronic products, with a focus on the transition to a circular economy. The results show that the literature on automated disassembly is highly focused on intelligent scheduling strategies, object recognition, sorting, tooling, disassembly, and robotic solutions, with particular emphasis on robotic cell design, robot kinematics, and human-robot collaboration. This review makes a significant contribution to the growing academic discourse on automated recycling and the circular economy, while laying the groundwork for future research and innovation by postulating a comprehensive research agenda.

AB  - “The fundamental principle of systems thinking is the ability to look at events, objects and phenomena from various perspectives considered as an aggregate” (O’Connor and McDermott 2006). The article continues studying the issue of preventing the occurrence of causes of death on Russian roads, i.e. “zero” mortality. The study results are presented in a series of articles published in the “Transport of the Russian Federation” journal. It provides a rationale for the feasibility and relevance of applying a methodological approach, which is new for Russian science and practice, to solving the issue of ensuring road traffic safety (RTS) in the interpretation of its meaning, comparable with the meaning of the term “zero mortality”, namely, a multi-faceted approach that considers a multilateral assessment of the quality of management decisions adopted using the knowledge of a full set of different opinions on the objects of any complexity being studied. They include RTS assurance systems, for which a set of different opinions (aspects) regarding all their possible facets, sides, properties, features, etc. — on behalf of the state, authorities, operating structures, and society — can be transformed into a set of factors affecting the level of provided RTS, having a subset of “dangerous” factors that can become causes of death in road traffic accidents (RTAs) in the road traffic environment. The article contains: a digest of the above subset of factors, which are essential for the issue being studied and can serve as the basis for expanding the possibilities of forming a set of death causes, adjusting the functions and corresponding types of required activities functionally bound by a common goal; substantiation of a functional and structural mathematical model for the state RTS system, an algorithmic model for the mechanisms forming its main functional properties and subsets of non-accidental causes of death, which can be understood and addressed preventing the moment of a possible serious RTA, and accidental ones, which cannot be understood and addressed; a “starting” sample of literary sources, capable of expanding (when referring to the publications) and ensuring an increase in the progress of solving the issue of “zero mortality” on Russian roads by 2030 as established by the state strategy for RTS.

The trend motivated a significant amount of contributions to the analysis and design of ML applications against faults affecting the underlying hardware. The authors investigate the existing body of knowledge on Deep Learning (among ML techniques) resilience against hardware faults systematically through a thoughtful review in which the strengths and weaknesses of this literature stream are presented clearly and then future avenues of research are set out. The review reports 85 scientific articles published between January 2019 and March 2024, after carefully analysing 222 contributions (from an initial screening of eligible 244 publications). The authors adopt a classifying framework to interpret and highlight research similarities and peculiarities, based on several parameters, starting from the main scope of the work, the adopted fault and error models, to their reproducibility. This framework allows for a comparison of the different solutions and the identification of possible synergies. Furthermore, suggestions concerning the future direction of research are proposed in the form of open challenges to be addressed.

AB  - Objective
Therapeutic interventions for children and young people with dystonia and dystonic/dyskinetic cerebral palsy are limited. EEG-based neurofeedback is emerging as a neurorehabilitation tool. This scoping review maps research investigating EEG-based sensorimotor neurofeedback in adults and children with neurological motor impairments, including augmentative strategies.
Methods
MEDLINE, CINAHL and Web of Science databases were searched up to 2023 for relevant studies. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently by at least two reviewers.
Results
Of 4380 identified studies, 133 were included, only three enrolling children. The most common diagnosis was adult-onset stroke (77%). Paradigms mostly involved upper limb motor imagery or motor attempt. Common neurofeedback modes included visual, haptic and/or electrical stimulation. EEG parameters varied widely and were often incompletely described. Two studies applied augmentative strategies. Outcome measures varied widely and included classification accuracy of the Brain-Computer Interface, degree of enhancement of mu rhythm modulation or other neurophysiological parameters, and clinical/motor outcome scores. Few studies investigated whether functional outcomes related specifically to the EEG-based neurofeedback.
Conclusions
There is limited evidence exploring EEG-based sensorimotor neurofeedback in individuals with movement disorders, especially in children. Further clarity of neurophysiological parameters is required to develop optimal paradigms for evaluating sensorimotor neurofeedback.
Significance
The expanding field of sensorimotor neurofeedback offers exciting potential as a non-invasive therapy. However, this needs to be balanced by robust study design and detailed methodological reporting to ensure reproducibility and validation that clinical improvements relate to induced neurophysiological changes.

AB  - In the automotive domain, the development of all safety-critical systems has to comply with safety standards such as ISO 26262. These standards require established traceability, the ability to relate artifacts created during development of a system, to ensure resulting systems are well-tested and therefore safe. This paper contrasts general traceability challenges and solutions with those specific to the automotive domain, and investigates how they manifest in practice. We combine three data sources: a tertiary literature review to identify general challenges and solutions; a case study with an automotive supplier as validation for how the challenges and solutions are experienced in practice; and a multi-vocal literature review to identify challenges and solutions specific to the automotive domain. We found 22 challenges and 16 unique solutions in the reviews. 17 challenges were identified in the case study; six remain unsolved. We discuss challenges and solutions from the perspectives of academia, tool vendors, consultants and users, and identify differences between scientific and “grey” literature. We discuss why challenges remain unsolved and propose solutions. Our findings indicate that there is a significant overlap between general traceability challenges and those in the automotive domain but that they are experienced differently.

This paper proposes an in-depth and complete literature review of the revenue management (RM) issue in the passenger transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to investigate structural elements and characteristics that help to make sense of the current body of RM literature under a managerial perspective.
Design/methodology/approach
The RM literature landscape is analysed according to a systematic literature review approach to point out the main topics around which the scientific literature has grown in the past 30 years. Topics are further categorized in themes by means of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure.
Findings
First, the scientific literature of the past 30 years has been categorized into ten topics and four themes. Second, topics and themes are put in contrast with stages of the RM business process to highlight research areas still unaddressed by the literature. Third, the paper suggests research lines for future-related works that could positively contribute to the elevation of RM from a system of techniques to a “strategic management” theory.
Originality/value
Available literature reviews of RM in passenger transportation are focused on quantitative aspects and poorly structured in the systemic view of the RM. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first of its kind, as it aims to assess the whole body of literature, rather than specific themes, and to do it under a management/business perspective.

AB  - Arabinoxylans (AX) have become a focal point in the pharmaceutical sector owing to their physicochemical, biological, and functional properties. The purpose of this paper was to present a summary of the utilization of AX as drug release matrices through a bibliometric analysis (BA) and a literature review to spotlight the AX functional characteristics and their technological applications to promote this line of research. The BA was carried out using data from a Web of Science database research, specifically emphasizing the analysis of authors’ keywords. This approach was chosen due to its significance in comprehensively understanding a particular research field and its relevance for in-depth knowledge of a research field. The BA outcomes revealed limited information concerning the AX applications in both release matrices and as excipients in the formulation and development of drug delivery systems (DDS), so there is a need for additional scientific and technological research in these areas to address the existing information gaps. However, the literature review shows that the native and modified AX from different delivery release systems, such as macrogels (including films, tablets, and hard gelatin capsules) and multi-particulate systems (including micro and nanogels), present an excellent potential as release matrices of biomolecules and drugs, such as doxorubicin, diclofenac sodium, caffeine, gentamicin, tizanidine hydrochloride, and insulin. In conclusion, AX have a wide potential for application in the pharmaceutical industry, so this work is expected to be a reference point for future research by scientists, technologists, and entrepreneurs who cope with the subject.

AB  - Collisions between road users (drivers, cyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians) and trains at rail level crossings (RLXs) remain an intractable issue. This systematic review aimed to determine what is known regarding the factors influencing risk at RLXs, with a focus on understanding the causal relationships across the entire sociotechnical system. A systematic search identified 88 published studies. The studies were categorised according to the type of outcome measured or analysed: (1) rates and severity of crashes; (2) unsafe and non-compliant road user behaviours; and (3) road user risk perception, attitudes and beliefs. Most studies focused on unsafe and/or non-compliant road user behaviour. The factors identified within the studies as influencing risk at RLXs were classified using the Accident Mapping (AcciMap) technique, a systems analysis framework. AcciMap maps the factors that influence behaviour across six system levels ranging from Government to the operating environment. Most of the factors identified within the studies related to physical attributes of the crossing itself, its operation, and the behaviours and attributes of road users. Comparatively fewer systemic factors were identified (i.e. policy and budgeting). Few relationships between factors were identified, indicating that little consideration has been given interactions between factors (i.e. how crossing design influences end-user decision making). A research agenda is proposed based on systems thinking and the use of a ‘many model’ approach to understand and address risk at RLXs.

Game Software Engineering (GSE) is a branch of Software Engineering (SE) that focuses on the development of video game applications. In past years, GSE has achieved enough volume, differences from traditional software engineering, and interest by the community to be considered an independent scientific domain, veering out from traditional SE.
Objective:
This study evaluates the current state of the art in software engineering for industry-scale computer games identifying gaps and consolidating the magnitude and growth of this field.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review is performed following best practices to ensure the relevance of the studies included in the review. We analyzed 98 GSE studies to extract the current intensity, topics, methods, and quality of GSE.
Results:
The GSE research community has been growing over the years, producing over four times more research than before the previous GSE survey. However, this community is still very dispersed, with no main venues holding most of the GSE scientific studies. A broader range of topics is covered in this area, evolving towards those of a mature field such as architecture and design. Also, the reviewed studies employ more elaborated empirical research methods, even though the study reports need to be more rigorous in sections related to the critical examination of the work.
Conclusion:
The results of the SLR lead to the identification of 13 potential future research directions for this domain. GSE is an independent, mature, and growing field that presents new ways of software creation where the gap between industry and academia is narrowing. Video games present themselves as powerful tools to push the boundaries of software knowledge.

AB  - The transportation sector accounts for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, the electrification of this sector is a crucial contributor to the mitigation of global warming. Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles will be economically paired with internal combustion engine vehicles in the near future. However, relying on private vehicle decarbonization only cannot deliver comprehensive space management efficiency solutions in urban environments. Therefore, it is essential to invest in the technological development and deployment of electric buses for public transportation, directly enhancing the quality of life in large cities. From this perspective, this review examines a wide range of scientific literature on electric bus research using science mapping methods and content analysis to support critical thinking unveiling the main research streams, methods, and gaps of the field. The analysis indicates that future research on electric buses will be mainly devoted to sustainability (encompassing economic, environmental and quality of service dimensions), energy management strategies, and fleet operation.

AB  - Participatory modeling – the involvement of stakeholders in the modeling process – can support various objectives, such as stimulating learning processes or promoting mutual understanding of stakeholders. Participatory modeling approaches could therefore be useful for the governance of transitions, but a systematic account of potential application areas of participatory modeling methods in transition governance is still lacking. This article addresses this gap by providing a review of participatory modeling methods and linking them to phases and objectives of transition governance. We reviewed participatory modeling studies in transition research and related fields of social-ecological modeling, integrated assessment and environmental management. We find that participatory modeling methods are mostly used for participatory visioning and goal setting as well as for interactive strategy development. The review shows the potential for extending the application of participatory modeling methods to additional phases of transition governance and for the exchange of experiences between research fields.

AB  - Summary
Fuel cells utilize the chemical energy of liquid or gaseous fuels to generate electricity. As fuel cells extend their territory to include heavy-duty vehicles, new demands for proton conductors, a critical component of fuel cells, have emerged. A near-term need is ensuring the chemical and mechanical stability of proton exchange membranes to enable long lifetime vehicles. In the mid-term, achieving stable conductivity of proton conductors under hot (>100°C) and dynamic fuel cell operating conditions is desirable. In the long term, targeting high thermal stability and tolerance to water enables the utilization of high energy density liquid fuels that will increase pay-load space for heavy-duty vehicles. This article presents our perspective on these near-, mid-, and long-term targets for proton conductors of heavy-duty fuel cells.

AB  - In recent times, renewable energy sources have gained significant popularity because of the dwindling reserves of fossil fuels and the significant environmental damage resulting from their use. Among the various renewable energy sources, hydrogen stands out as one of the most crucial technologies for the future. Hydrogen can be produced through several different methods, and electrolysis is among the most frequently used methods. This method employs electrical energy to decompose water into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen molecules. When this electrical energy is derived from renewable sources such as solar or wind, then green hydrogen is produced. Systems that use electrolysis to produce hydrogen are known as electrolyzers. One of the primary challenges in the electrolysis process is ensuring the purity of hydrogen; proper control of the levels and pressures of the gas tanks can improve this purity. Automatic control strategies are very important for regulating the levels and pressures of the oxygen and hydrogen tanks. Researchers have proposed various classical techniques for controller design to mitigate this issue. This study seeks to offer a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing research on control methods for alkaline electrolyzers, which has attracted considerable attention in recent times. The findings of this review offer valuable insight for future studies aimed at developing new control strategies to enhance hydrogen purity.

AB  - While CRM technology implementation initiatives frequently end up as failures, most research has focused on user related reasons for understanding low success rates. This study extends CRM research backwards into the system implementation phase to improve understanding of the hitherto unexplored technical antecedents of CRM success. We advance a resource-based theory of CRM system capability (CRMSC) to explain how firm- and project-level capabilities act to influence organizational performance. Empirical findings from a survey matching 148 IT manager and 474 end-user responses support the conceptualization of CRMSC as a project-level capability, and suggest that CRMSC and system quality mediate the effects of firm-level IT capability on organizational productivity gains and productivity gain discrepancy. The study complements extant understanding about the link between strategic and operational IT capabilities by offering actionable insight on the combination of resources firms need to deliver a CRM system that enhances performance.

AB  - Many studies on teams report measures of team communication; however, these studies vary widely in terms of the team characteristics, situations, and tasks studied making it difficult to understand impacts on team communication more generally. The objective of this review is systematically summarize relationships between measures of team communication and team characteristics and situational contexts. A literature review was conducted searching in four electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Ergonomics Abstracts, and SocINDEX). Additional studies were identified by cross-referencing. Articles included for final review had reported at least one team communication measure associated with some team and/or context dimension. Ninety-nine of 727 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data extracted from articles included characteristics of the studies and teams and the nature of each of the reported team and/or context dimensions–team communication properties relationships. Some dimensions (job role, situational stressors, training strategies, cognitive artifacts, and communication media) were found to be consistently linked to changes in team communication. A synthesized diagram that describes the possible associations between eleven team and context dimensions and nine team communication measures is provided along with research needs.

KW  - Systematic literature review
AB  - Purpose
Even though the implementation of lean in health care environments is relatively recent, it has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. Partly because of the fact that it is a recent field of practise and research and partly because the number of works developed in this field has grown rapidly, it is important to frequently update the perspectives on this field of investigation. Thus, this study aims to review the implementation of lean tools and techniques applied to hospital organizational areas in a five-year period, between 2014 and 2018, complementing some of the most relevant reviews already published. The most important criteria such as tools, methods and principles, hospital areas intervened, improvements and difficulties were assessed and quantified.
Design/methodology/approach
As starting point for this systematic literature review (SLR), a set of selected pre-existing review publications was used to support the current study and as the ground base for the expansion of the studies about lean health care. The current study contemplated 114 articles from a five-year period between 2014 and 2018. A subset of 58 of these articles was critically assessed to understand the application of lean tools and methods in different hospital areas.
Findings
The thorough analysis of selected articles show a lack of works in continuous improvement approaches when compared to the application of production organization methods, visual management and diagnosing and problem-solving tools. The reported improvement results demonstrate alignment with the principles and foundations of lean philosophy, but such results are presented in isolated initiatives and without robust evidence of long-term maintenance. Moreover, this study shows an evolution in the number of articles referring to lean implementation in hospital areas, but in its great majority, such articles report isolated implementations in different areas, not spreading those for the global organization. Thus, some of the main recommendations are the need to implement studies on complete flows of patients, drugs and materials, instead of isolated initiatives and strive to promote the cultural change of hospitals through structural changes, following new visions and strategic objectives, supported by real models of continuous structural and sustained improvement.
Originality/value
The current study develops a new perspective of the articles published under the thematic of lean health care, published in a recent period of five years, which are not completely covered by other works. Additionally, it explicitly applied, in an innovative way, an approach that used a set of previous reviews as the starting point for this SLR. In this way, it integrates approaches and categories from different SLRs, creating a framework of analysis that can be used by future researchers. Finally, it shows the most recent implementations of lean health care, exposing the current trends, improvements and also the main gaps.

AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have drastically simplified the creation of synthetic media. While concerns often focus on potential misinformation harms, ‘non-consensual intimate deepfakes’ (NCID) – a form of image-based sexual abuse – pose a current, severe, and growing threat, disproportionately impacting women and girls. This article examines the measures implemented with the recently adopted Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA) and argues that the new criminal offences and the ‘systems and processes’ approach the law adopts are insufficient to counter NCID in the UK. This is because the OSA relies on platform policies that often lack consistency regarding synthetic media and on platforms’ content removal mechanisms which offer limited redress to victim-survivors after the harm has already occurred. The article argues that stronger prevention mechanisms are necessary and proposes that the law should mandate all AI-powered deepfake creation tools to ban the generation of intimate synthetic content and require the implementation of comprehensive and enforceable content moderation systems.

AB  - The increasing adoption of collaborative robots to support job execution in manufacturing has catalyzed companies’ attention to safety and well-being issues. Sharing the human-centric perspective and harmonious human–machine collaboration concepts emphasized by Industry 5.0, the design phase of a collaborative workstation must integrate both psychological and physical risk evaluations to provide a safe and inclusive work environment suitable for a diversified workforce. Accelerating the pre-deployment phase to quickly reconfigure workstation design and assess its impact on workload balancing and task sequencing during the deployment of assembly lines still represents a challenging task considering the available software tools. This research proposes a new mathematical model to accelerate the design of ergonomic human-robot collaborative workstations based on task alternatives and the combined consideration of postural assessment and fatigue analyses for each of them to design an ergo-friendly collaborative environment. Surface electromyography analysis is jointly adopted with postural risk assessment measured with inertial measurement units and developed by a digital ergonomic platform to determine the optimal workplace configuration for tools, equipment, and resources to promote physical well-being while considering station productivity. Experimental tests are performed to investigate arm muscles and postural risk assessment for different configurations of workstation design and collaborative human-robot job progression. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, and the advantages of the proposed approach compared to existing simulation software to quickly generate and assess alternative scenarios and find a trade-off between ergo-quality levels and system performance. The final discussion offers valuable information for decision-makers and practitioners to facilitate the integration of human factors throughout the early stages of ergo-friendly workspace design, while effectively managing the complexity generated by resource allocation and collaborative robots.

AB  - In the context of a rapidly expanding electric vehicle market, this research investigates the ideal locations for Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (EVCS) and capacitors in power grids to enhance voltage stability and reduce power losses, facilitating sustainable and efficient grid operation. Meeting the increasing demand for EV charging stations while simultaneously addressing grid reliability, voltage control, and power loss issues poses significant challenges. A hybrid approach for EV parking lot and optimal location of capacitors in voltage and power loss is proposed in this manuscript. The proposed hybrid method combines the Fire Hawk Optimizer and Spiking Neural Network, hence called the FHO-SNN technique. The objective of the proposed method is used to lessen the active-power-losses that improve system performance. The novelty of this proposed method is electric vehicle parking lot and optimal location of capacitors in voltage and lessens the power loss. The proposed system is done in the MATLAB, and it is validates their performance with existing methods, such as Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Seagull Optimization (SO), and Atomic Orbital Search (AOS). The proposed method shows low convergence time, which is 4 sec, number of feeders, and best function node is found compared with other existing methods. The optimization approach can enhance the stability and efficiency of electric grids by improving voltage profiles and reducing power losses. The implications of this research highlight the potential for optimizing the combination of electric vehicles and capacitors into the grid, resulting in a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient energy and transportation system.

AB  - The paper proposes a validated analytical model for hybrid reverse osmosis (RO) and flash desalination systems powered by photovoltaic/thermal collector collectors. The thermal energy is utilized to increase the feedwater temperature, while the electrical energy is utilized to drive the reciprocating compressor/pump to supply the necessary pressures for the RO and flash desalination. The system aims to provide a solution for bottled water in remote areas and reduce the brine and power pollution from desalination systems. The performance of the PV/T collector, RO desalinated water flux and power consumption, and flash desalination unit drinkable water production are investigated under different weather and operating conditions, including solar radiation intensity, ambient temperature, wind speed, feedwater temperature and concentration, and RO operating pressure. The analytical study reveals that solar radiation, feedwater temperature and concentration, and RO operating pressure have a significant influence on the system's performance compared to other conditions. Other factors, such as ambient temperature and wind speed, have a relatively small impact on the system's performance. Overall, the proposed system has the potential to provide a sustainable solution for bottled water in outlying areas and to reduce the environmental impact of conventional desalination systems.

AB  - Hydrogen shows great promise as a versatile energy carrier for various clean energy applications; however, it remains challenging to develop an efficient and safe storage system. Hydrogen must be stored in chemical materials like ammonia borane (NH3BH3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or metal hydride materials for proper use. Among the frequently reported hydrides, magnesium hydride (MgH2) gained significant consideration as a highly prospective material for energy storage applications. Nevertheless, the hands-on use of MgH2 is restricted by its high thermodynamic barriers and slow kinetics. Therefore, nanoconfinement of MgH2 in porous materials has appeared as a promising strategy to enhance its kinetics and thermodynamic performance. This review paper summarizes the present research on how nanoconfinement influences the kinetics and thermodynamics of MgH2 during the hydrogen adsorption/desorption process within different porous scaffolds. The review also highlights the challenges associated with the nanoconfinement approach, including the need for a fundamental understanding of the nanoconfinement effects and the development of materials with enhanced stability and cycling performance. Finally, future research directions that could lead to high storage capacity at ambient conditions based on nanoconfined MgH2 were explained. Based on the study findings, the most promising scaffolds are carbon-based materials due to their high surface area, tunable pore structures, lightweight nature, and excellent thermal and chemical stability. Hopefully, this article will serve as an eye-opening point for prospective studies in hydrogen storage using MgH2 through confinement in porous scaffolds.

AB  - Research into the organisation of building project information began to bear fruit in the 1950s when the first classification system for the construction industry was introduced. Driven by the growing use of digital tools and technologies and by the first publication of ISO 12006-2 in 2001, this research topic has become incredibly popular in recent years. However, the absence of accurate historical traceability in the literature makes it difficult to understand the origin and evolution of the most prominent classification systems. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of selected commonly used classification systems published in the last seven decades, delving into those developed in Sweden, the UK and the USA/Canada. Furthermore, the latest classification system launched by each of these countries (CoClass, Uniclass 2015 and OmniClass®, respectively) has been chosen to analyse, compare and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. The results of this research show that there is no consensus on the use of a common international classification system for the built environment. Although organisations worldwide are working diligently towards an internationally accepted standard classifier, the use of national classification systems still prevails. The main gaps to be bridged in this area are discussed in the paper and can be summarised as follows: (i) barriers are found to classify construction elements of residential buildings in a consistent, unambiguous and standardised manner, (ii) commonly used classification systems are designed so that the information required is acquired during the design and construction stages, and (iii) further work is needed to address the challenges of properly classifying construction elements at the operation and maintenance stage.

AB  - The developing agri-food sector significantly boosts food production and plays a crucial role in resolving the global food crisis. This development is valuable when accompanied by environmental sustainability. The indiscriminate use of fossil energy sources in these industries has raised serious environmental concerns in recent years. As a result, researchers have explored the substitution of renewable energies, particularly solar energy, as a means of resource conservation. However, concerns about the environmental effects of solar technology establishment have prompted investigations into their environmental footprints. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has emerged as a valuable tool for systematically evaluating the potential environmental impacts of solar energy. Furthermore, combining LCA with exergetic analysis as the main tool for assessing energy utilization can help identify the most sustainable scenarios. In this context, the present study provides a systematic and comprehensive review and critical discussion of the environmental LCA and exergetic analysis of applied solar technologies in the agri-food sector. The study first introduces all the utilized technologies in detail. It then discusses the principles, steps, and methods of LCA and exergetic analysis employed by researchers. Based on the analysis of 116 considered studies, it is concluded that photovoltaic (PV), photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T), and concentrated solar power systems (CSP) are the leading solar technologies in the agri-food sector. The study further concludes that PV systems are the most exergoenvironmentally friendly among all solar systems, while the CSP system exhibits favorable characteristics compared to PV/T, particularly from the perspective of LCA.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative technology used in manufacturing, environmental monitoring, home automation, human health applications, and other fields. IoT devices, however, are susceptible to various security risks. Cyber-attacks on IoT systems can halt the entire system, resulting in data loss. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can quickly identify malicious activity that could have compromised the network's performance. Effective IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) are necessary to protect IoT systems. Blockchain technology presents another innovative method to strengthen security systems against the latest attacks. This paper focuses on conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Blockchain-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems in IoT Networks. We reviewed several relevant blockchain-based IDS and IPS proposed for IoT networks and their mechanisms. The most recent research articles, published between 2017 and 2022, were selected from several databases. Consequently, a comprehensive review of these selected papers sheds light on their techniques, advantages, and drawbacks.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to compare open-source suites for electrochemical battery simulations in terms of simulation output and computation time. The proposed approach leverages the Battery Parameter eXchange standard to introduce a parameter porting framework that supports the implementation of equivalent cell parameters across suites, and provides a method for solver tolerance selection used for computational speed comparison. The methodology is showcased by comparing two of the most comprehensive open-source suites, PyBaMM and TOOFAB. While both provide lean model implementation, PyBaMM shows more versatility and faster mean simulation times, with TOOFAB closing the gap on simulations with coarser discretizations, particularly when order reductions are applied. Furthermore, considering portability to C and implementation simplicity, TOOFAB has a strong advantage.

However, existing solutions are facing a number of challenges preventing them from being used in our everyday tasks: (i) robots operate in unknown environments, (ii) robots collaborate with each other and even with humans, and (iii) robots shall never injure people or create damages. Researchers are targeting those challenges from various perspectives, producing a fragmented research landscape. We aim at providing a comprehensive and replicable picture of the state of the art from a software engineering perspective on existing solutions aiming at managing safety for mobile robotic systems. We apply the systematic mapping methodology on an initial set of 1274 potentially relevant research papers, we selected 58 primary studies and analyzed them according to a systematically-defined classification framework. This work contributes with (i) a classification framework for methods or techniques for managing safety when dealing with the software of mobile robotic systems (MSRs), (ii) a map of current software methods or techniques for software safety for MRSs, (iii) an elaboration on emerging challenges and implications for future research, and (iv) a replication package for independent replication and verification of this study. Our results confirm that generally existing solutions are not yet ready to be used in everyday life. There is the need of turn-key solutions ready to deal with all the challenges mentioned above.

AB  - The integration of AI technology with digital transformation has profoundly shaped the evolution towards digital triplet architecture, grounded in human-centric methodologies. By infusing human intellectual activities into both physical and cyberspace, innovative links between humans and machines are established. Despite limitations in transitioning from tangible human presence to the digital realm in cyberspace, extensive efforts are underway to harness emotional, visual, and oral responses, thereby enhancing the reasoning and predictive capabilities of digital twins. These advancements aim to elevate real-time human interactions with physical and virtual systems by integrating intelligent AI algorithms and cognitive computing systems into digital twins. This paper meticulously analyses recent trends in digital twins, tracing their evolution from traditional concepts and applications to a nuanced digital triplet hierarchy that incorporates human intuition, knowledge, and creativity within cyberspace. we delve into the hierarchical framework of the digital triplet, resonating with maturity, domination, and volition levels, enhances cognitive and perceptual capabilities in cyberspace. The study provides a systematic overview of the development of ultra-realistic digital models, incorporating real-time data-driven artefacts that integrate intelligent activities with multidomain, multiphysics, and multiscale simulations. The research scope is focused on augmenting the perceptive and heuristic capabilities of the digital triplet framework by utilizing AI in data analytics, retrieving heterogeneous data from virtual entities using semantic artificial intelligence technologies, and amalgamating AI and machine learning with human insight and perceptual knowledge. The proposed digital triplet hierarchy aims to enhance cyberspace's capacity for learning, cognitive skills, and knowledge transfer. It can be a guideline for the researcher to promote cognitive augmentation of the human brain through brain-machine/computer interface, virtual, augmented, and extended reality, fostering a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines in the industrial metaverse and industry 5.0. The paper discusses future directions for research and the challenges involved in developing intelligent digital twins towards the digital triplet paradigm, aiming to embody intelligent activities and cognitive capabilities within the framework of human–machine symbiosis.

AB  - During recent years, electrofuels (fuels from electricity, water, and carbon) have gained increased interest as substitute for fossil fuels in all energy and chemical sectors. The feasibility of electrofuels has been assessed from a range of aspects but no study has assessed the land area needed if scaling up the production based on renewables. The amount of land on Earth is limited and the competition for land, in a long-term perspective, imposes a risk of, e.g., increased food prices and biodiversity losses. The aim of this paper is to assess how much land area it would require if all fossil fuels were substituted by electrofuels (‘All electrofuel’-scenario) and compare this with the area needed if all fossil fuels were substituted by bioenergy (‘All biomass’-scenario) or by electricity (‘All electric’-scenario). Each scenario represents extreme cases towards fully renewable energy systems to outline the theoretical area needed. Main conclusions are (1) the electricity demand, if substituting all fossil fuels with electrofuels, is huge (1540 EJ) but technically obtainable, demanding 1.1% of the Earth's surface, for solar panels, in the most optimistic case, and (2) the sustainable technical potential for biomass cannot alone substitute all fossil fuels, unless radical energy demand reductions.

AB  - Vacuum-based membrane dehumidifiers (VMDs), an emerging air dehumidification technology, use selective membranes to remove moisture from humid air; these dehumidifiers have the potential to save energy and enhance thermodynamic efficiency through decoupled latent and sensible cooling. In this study, a prototype of a vacuum-based membrane dehumidifier at the scale of an air-conditioning system was developed, and its dehumidification characteristics were experimentally evaluated under various test conditions (i.e., air temperature, air humidity, air velocity, and pressure on the permeate side). Four indices were selected to examine the dehumidification performance of the system: the humidity ratio difference, moisture removal rate, dehumidification efficacy, and performance coefficient. The results revealed that the humidity ratio difference ranged 3.38–14.76 g/kg, moisture removal rate 0.16–1.09 kg/h, dehumidification effectiveness 35.4 %–82.7 %, and COP 0.16–0.86. In the parametric analysis of the prototype, the airflow rate and humidity ratio are identified as essential parameters for the dehumidification performance. Moreover, the thermodynamic perspective in the Psychrometric chart and transient operation were utilized to evaluate the operational characteristics of the prototype unit. All experimental results showed that the difference in temperature between the inlet and outlet air was less than 1.5 °C, and the saturation time is shown to be within 5 min.

AB  - In this era of Big Data and the advancement of sophisticated analytical techniques, the financial industry has the capacity to implement innovative technologies within their systems to derive crucial insights about their clientele and vigilantly monitor their activities. This landscape has seen the emergence and rise of two significant applications, namely, customer segmentation systems and early warning systems. Therefore, this study presents a systematic literature review on the automation of customer segmentation and early warning techniques with a focus on managing credit portfolio entities. The research delves into a multitude of scholarly articles from three distinct perspectives: charting the dominant trends within the literature, unpacking the overarching themes, and critically examining the integration of early warning signals within customer clustering applications. Furthermore, the review reveals a noticeable dearth of studies probing the synergistic application of these two systems. Despite their independent effectiveness in risk management and targeted marketing strategies respectively, an integrated approach holds potential for bolstering financial stability and tailoring customer service. Thus, this review stands as a significant academic contribution, advocating an integrated application of these systems within the financial industry. The findings provide a novel foundation for future research and practical applications, potentially redefining strategies within the financial sector.

AB  - EU data protection law requires that digital service providers and system developers put in place technical measures that are adequate to protect children’s informational privacy. The stringent legal obligations of implementing principles of data protection by design into digital systems intensified the engineers’ need to create processes and technological solutions to enhance children’s privacy in digital services. However, in several cases, generic controls have proven to have limited effects on the protection of children’s privacy, raising questions about the need to further develop children- specific technical controls. This paper contributes to address the need for privacy controls by providing (a) a summary of real-world applications of information technologies domains that expose children to privacy risks, and (b) a list that represents the state-of-the-art of the technical controls designed specifically to protect children’s privacy. We identify 24 technical controls that we manually classify with NIST Security and Privacy control categories and Hoepman’s Privacy design strategies. We find that most controls relate to identification and authentication, many of which in the form of techniques for age verification. In general, the vast majority of controls belong to minimization strategies. Our findings show that the field of technical controls specifically designed for children is yet to be developed.

AB  - Factories are complex systems, which are characterized by interlinked and overlapping life cycles of the constituent factory elements. Within this context, the heterogeneity of these life cycles results in life cycle complexity and corresponding conflicts and trade-offs that need to be addressed in decision situations during the planning and operation of factory systems. Also with respect to the transformation need towards environmental sustainability, there is a need for methods and tools for life cycle oriented factory planning and operation. This paper systematically reviews existing life cycle concepts of factory systems as well as frameworks, models and methods for the evaluation and engineering of factory life cycles. In order to respond to the above challenges, a general understanding about the factory life cycle, e.g. life cycle stages, related activities and interdependencies, is developed and action areas of life cycle engineering are discussed that could supplement factory planning. Following that, the paper presents an integrated, model-based evaluation and engineering framework of factory life cycles.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation is precipitating wide-ranging and often irreversible changes in cities and at the shifting peri-urban areas around the world. As a significant factor of change in the 21st Century, urbanisation is irreversibly transforming everything on its path―air, land, water, and ecology, including institutions, customs, and lifestyles. The subject scope of urbanisation research is therefore quite wide and diverse. Yet, urbanisation-induced attritions and substitutions of customary tenure practices, coupled with the associated politics and resistances, remain utterly overlooked. Using a mixed method approach (involving desktop research, remote sensing data and stakeholder interviews), this paper examines the clashes between customary tenure regime and statutory practices dictated by urban laws, and how different stakeholders are appropriating them both to promote and resist displacement or eviction. Amidst growing encroachment pressures on peri-urban communities in Nigerian cities, a new imperative for enhanced tenure security and integrated planning approach are proposed.

AB  - Zero Energy Building (ZEB) is gaining more attention as a solution to significantly mitigate the environment concerns. However, a bibliometric analysis of the topic, a very useful method to analyze the database of published publications and reviews, is lacking. Especially, to provide when and how this concept has been brought out, insights into the state-of-art technology, the findings of the collaboration networks and the challenges of ZEB. To address this gap, in this paper, ZEB studies have been reviewed using multiple perspectives and analytical tools, such as VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to analyze the collaboration networks and the thematic trends of ZEB publications. The original data was retrieved in Scopus, a total of 1051 documents including research articles and reviews published from 1976 to 2020. The analysis of the number of publications over the years shows that the development of Zero energy building research has gone through three stages: a slow development period from 1076 to 1999, followed by a development from 2000 to 2010 and finally a rapid development from 2011 to 2020. The study also reveals different rankings, including the most widely collaborated scholars, the most cited scholars, the most published countries, etc. Therein, the United State, United Kingdom and China have the most research on ZEB. Based on the analysis of co-occurrence network and evolution of thematic keywords, it is found that energy efficiency and life cycle assessment (LCA) are the main challenges for the achievement of ZEB target. Finally, these challenges have been discussed and solutions provided.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have recently gained prominence as emerging pollutants due to their significant negative impacts on diverse living forms in ecosystems, including humans, by altering their endocrine systems. EDCs are a prominent category of emerging contaminants in various aquatic settings. Given the growing population and limited access to freshwater resources, their expulsion from aquatic systems is also a severe issue. EDC removal from wastewater depends on the physicochemical properties of the specific EDCs found in each wastewater type and various aquatic environments. Due to these components' chemical, physical, and physicochemical diversity, various approaches based on physical, biological, electrochemical, and chemical procedures have been developed to eliminate them. The objective of this review is to provide the comprehensive overview by selecting recent approaches that showed significant impact on the best available methods for removing EDCs from various aquatic matrices. It is suggested that adsorption by carbon-based materials or bioresources is effective at higher EDC concentrations. Electrochemical mechanization works, but it requires expensive electrodes, continual energy, and chemicals. Due to the lack of chemicals and hazardous byproducts, adsorption and biodegradation are considered environmentally friendly. When combined with synthetic biology and an AI system, biodegradation can efficiently remove EDCs and replace conventional water treatment technologies in the near future. Hybrid in-house methods may reduce EDCs best, depending on the EDC and resources.

Background
Socially assistive robots are increasingly used as a therapeutic tool for people with dementia, as a means to improve quality of life through social connection. This paper presents a mixed-method integrative review of telepresence robots used to improve social connection of people with dementia by enabling real-time communication with their carers.
Methods
A systematic search of Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library was conducted to gather available evidence on the use of telepresence robots, specifically videoconferencing, to improve social connectedness, in people with dementia. A narrative synthesis was used to analyze the included studies.
Results
A review of 1,035 records, identified four eligible peer-reviewed publications, reporting findings about three different mobile telepresence robots. The study designs included qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, focusing primarily on examining the feasibility and acceptability of the telepresence robots within the context of dementia care. These studies reported both positive outcomes of using telepresence robots to connect people with dementia to others, as well as barriers, such as a lack of experience in using a robot and technological issues.
Conclusion
Although limited, the current literature suggests that telepresence robots have potential utility for improving social connectedness of people with dementia and their carers. However, more systematic feasibility studies are needed to inform the development of telepresence robots followed by clinical trials to establish efficacy within dementia care.

AB  - By amalgamating recent communication and control technologies, computing and data analytics techniques, and modular manufacturing, Industry 4.0 promotes integrating cyber–physical worlds through cyber–physical systems (CPS) and digital twin (DT) for monitoring, optimization, and prognostics of industrial processes. A DT enables interaction with the digital image of the industrial physical objects/processes to simulate, analyze, and control their real-time operation. DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G-and-Beyond networks) and design tools, and current computational intelligence paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing-enabled data analytics, federated learning). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.

AB  - Future possibilities for manufacturing companies using cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often described by production characteristics, which however existed long before CPS. Therefore, this paper deals with the unambiguous identification and structuring of CPS descriptive production properties to develop a common understanding across papers and makes a proposal in the form of a classification system for production characteristics, which are established in scientific literature. The paper presents an identification method consisting of a distance-based network visualization to describe the relationship between CPS and production characteristics as an overall result of a comprehensive reference analysis, which is capable of representing the current state of science.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) has become worldwide an effective pathway for sustainable development against the linear model. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) tools have been identified either as booster of circularity and as supporter for the achievement of sustainable development goals. Environmental Management System (EMS), Green Public Procurement (GPP), Ecodesign Directive, Ecolabel, Energy Label and Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) have been considered either by academic and practitioners as tools useful to promote CE. Although the attention on SCP tools and CE has growth, no studies have investigated the linkages between these two topics. To bridge this gap, the aim of this study is to provide a literature review on the integration between CE and SCP tools. The revisited material consisted of 455 studies and was evaluated using a systematic approach. By critically analysing 35 papers, the study identified EMS and Ecodesign as the tools with the highest level of integration with CE, while the other tools seem to be characterized by a “stand-alone” approach. However, the in-depth analysis of the results highlighted that there is still room for improvement of scholars’ contribution on the integration between SCP tools and CE. We identified three main areas for future research agenda in order to spur further academic and technical debate. The first major area concerns the role of EMS in increasing organisations’ circularity; The second main area includes Ecodesign Directive and ETV in the design and manufacturing processes of the products; the third main area focuses on GPP, Ecolabel and Energy Label in driving greener consumption by setting products’ circular criteria.

AB  - As computer vision algorithms increase in capability, their applications in clinical systems will become more pervasive. These applications include: diagnostics, such as colonoscopy and bronchoscopy; guiding biopsies, minimally invasive interventions, and surgery; automating instrument motion; and providing image guidance using pre-operative scans. Many of these applications depend on the specific visual nature of medical scenes and require designing algorithms to perform in this environment. In this review, we provide an update to the field of camera-based tracking and scene mapping in surgery and diagnostics in medical computer vision. We begin with describing our review process, which results in a final list of 515 papers that we cover. We then give a high-level summary of the state of the art and provide relevant background for those who need tracking and mapping for their clinical applications. After which, we review datasets provided in the field and the clinical needs that motivate their design. Then, we delve into the algorithmic side, and summarize recent developments. This summary should be especially useful for algorithm designers and to those looking to understand the capability of off-the-shelf methods. We maintain focus on algorithms for deformable environments while also reviewing the essential building blocks in rigid tracking and mapping since there is a large amount of crossover in methods. With the field summarized, we discuss the current state of the tracking and mapping methods along with needs for future algorithms, needs for quantification, and the viability of clinical applications. We then provide some research directions and questions. We conclude that new methods need to be designed or combined to support clinical applications in deformable environments, and more focus needs to be put into collecting datasets for training and evaluation.

AB  - The remarkable ability of titanium alloys to preserve their superior physical and chemical characteristics when subjected to extreme conditions significantly enhances their importance in the aerospace, military, and medical sectors. However, conventional machining of titanium alloys leads to elevated tool wear, development of surface defects, and reduced machining efficiency due to their low heat conductivity, and chemical affinity. These issues can be somewhat counteracted by integrating ultrasonic vibration in the conventional machining of titanium alloys and also enhance sustainability. This review article offers a holistic evaluation of the influence of ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling and turning on cutting forces, temperature, tool wear, and surface integrity, encompassing surface morphology, surface roughness, surface residual stress, surface hardness, and surface tribological properties during titanium alloys machining. Furthermore, it investigates the sustainability aspect that has not been previously examined. Studies on the performance of ultrasonic-assisted cutting revealed several advantages, including decreased cutting forces and cutting temperature, improved tool life, and a better-machined surface during machining. Consequently, the sustainability factor is improved due to minimized energy consumption and residual waste. In conclusion, the key challenges and future prospects in the ultrasonic-assisted cutting of titanium alloys are also discussed. This review article provides beneficial knowledge for manufacturers and researchers regarding ultrasonic vibration-assisted cutting of titanium alloy and will play an important role in achieving sustainability in the industry.

AB  - Situation awareness is shown through human factors research to be a valuable construct to understand and improve how humans perform while operating complex systems in critical environments. Within cyber security one such environment is the Security Operations Center (SOC). With the increasing threat of hybrid warfare, knowledge about situation awareness within SOC environments, where human error or low performance may be detrimental, must be developed. This paper reports on the results of a Systematic Descriptive Literature Review of the current research on situation awareness within SOCs. The goal of the paper is to analyze how situation awareness is understood in the current research. To achieve this goal three aspects of understanding were addressed: Theoretical foundations; levels of conceptualization; and measurement of situation awareness. Theoretical foundations in the literature were assessed by how situation awareness was defined and the presence of references to theoretical models of SA. The results show a clear trend of basing the research on Endsley's three level situation awareness model; this model has been developed into a domain specific formulation called “Cyber Situation Awareness”. Some parts of the literature, particularly in research aimed at developing tools for improving situation awareness, lack a theoretical foundation; some refer to alternative theoretical foundations of situation awareness like Stanton et al.’s Distributed Situation Awareness. Further, a balance between conceptualizations on the individual, group and system level has been identified. Within research aimed at developing tools for improving situation awareness there are some examples of specialized and precise measurements of situation awareness, but in general the research seems too reliant on indirect measures of situation awareness. The paper concludes with the proposition of connecting the systems-based theoretical perspective of distributed situation awareness into the research, utilizing a systems level conceptualization of situation awareness. This might prove to be a useful bridge between the human cognitive perspective of situation awareness and the development of the complex technical environment of critical importance that SOCs represent.

AB  - The objective of this study is to conduct a bibliometric review of literature on electronic invoicing to provide an understanding of the growing field and valuable sources for future research. A total of 191 papers within the period of 1997 to July 2021 were included in our analysis. The systemic analysis revealed several insights in research progression over two decades, relevant authors and leading institutions including countries, most frequent keywords, and the principal methodologies and theories adopted. Although the field of electronic invoicing is still emerging, it is interesting to see trending keywords such as ‘data mining’, ‘automation’, ‘blockchain’, ‘digital storage’, and ‘machine learning’ as demonstrated in recent publications. The study also attempted to develop a framework and proposed an integrated theory of electronic invoicing since the general theoretical framework does not exist in the literature. Several research gaps were exposed related to more studies in the emerging field of electronic invoicing and how future studies could further shape the field by addressing yet unanswered questions. We anticipate that the findings in this study will be a valuable contribution and resource for e-invoicing research.

AB  - To facilitate the personalized smart manufacturing paradigm with cognitive automation capabilities, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has attracted ever-increasing attention by offering an adaptive and flexible solution. DRL takes the advantages of both Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), by embracing the power of representation learning, to make precise and fast decisions when facing dynamic and complex situations. Ever since the first paper of DRL was published in 2013, its applications have sprung up across the manufacturing field with exponential publication growth year by year. However, there still lacks any comprehensive review of the DRL in the field of smart manufacturing. To fill this gap, a systematic review process was conducted, with 261 relevant publications selected to date (20-Oct-2022), to gain a holistic understanding of the development, application, and challenges of DRL in smart manufacturing along the whole engineering lifecycle. First, the concept and development of DRL are summarized. Then, the typical DRL applications are analyzed in the four engineering lifecycle stages: design, manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance. Finally, the challenges and future directions are illustrated, especially emerging DRL-related technologies and solutions that can improve the manufacturing system’s deployment feasibility, cognitive capability, and learning efficiency, respectively. It is expected that this work can provide an insightful guide to the research of DRL in the smart manufacturing field and shed light on its future perspectives.

AB  - Since the introduction of the concept of “digital twins” (DTs) in 2002, the number of practical applications in different industrial sectors has grown rapidly. Despite the hype surrounding this technology, companies face significant challenges upon deciding to implement DTs in their organizations due to the novelty of the concept. Furthermore, little research on DT has been conducted for the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of accurately representing and modeling the physics behind production processes. To consolidate the fragmented literature on the enabling factors and challenges in DT implementation in the process industry, this study organizes the existing studies on DTs with a focus on barriers and enablers. On this basis, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on DTs by organizing the DT literature and by proposing conceptual models describing enablers of and barriers to DT implementation, as well as their mutual relationships.
