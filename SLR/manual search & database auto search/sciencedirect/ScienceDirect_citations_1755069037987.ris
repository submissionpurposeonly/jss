AB  - We introduce a comprehensive guide to improve literature sampling in systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) in management and adjacent social science disciplines. Analyzing 404 SLRs and MAs from top-tier management-related journals and the 135 methodological studies on which they relied revealed significant opportunities to improve sampling quality. We found that inadequate guidance and an overreliance on unfounded “best practices” often leads to suboptimal search strategies and incomplete reporting. To improve literature sampling, we have developed a guide that details four sequenced and prioritized scoping, searching, screening, and reporting steps. The guide also includes recommendations for the most suitable literature databases to search with, suggested (AI-enabled) tool support, and two checks to validate the effectiveness of search strategies. We created this guide by adapting the state-of-the-art recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA—the widely acknowledged benchmarks in methodical and reporting guidance—and supplementing them with additional evidence-based methodological insights. By adopting the guide, authors can ensure their sampling is effective and meets the high standards of SLRs and MAs, thereby likely boosting the impact of their review. The guide is applicable to all review types that require comprehensive, transparent, and reproducible sampling, including bibliometric studies and integrative reviews.

AB  - Urban mobility is a complex system influenced by various factors such as infrastructure, technology, and human behavior. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating and understanding urban mobility dynamics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of ABM applications in urban human mobility, offering insights into prevailing trends in this field. The analysis of model scales highlights the predominance of area and city scales, highlighting the need for greater exploration at the intersection, metropolis, and street scales. Furthermore, the examination of technological environments shows a reliance on desktop and laptop computers, complemented by a growing adoption of specialized ABM tools such as SUMO, Anylogic, NetLogo, GAMA, and MATSim. Additionally, the study correlates ABM objectives with societal needs, revealing areas of alignment and gaps. While competitiveness and smart mobility receive considerable attention, there is a pronounced lack of focus on improving urban accessibility, sustainability, and public health. The analysis underscores the importance of addressing these gaps to ensure that ABM applications contribute effectively to addressing societal challenges.

AB  - Resumen
El sistema educativo es un agente socializador importante. En muchas ocasiones, es señalado como solución de los problemas que padece la sociedad. Sin embargo, al mismo tiempo, es donde más discriminación sufren las personas trans, aun sabiendo las implicaciones que esto conlleva hacia su salud mental. Por esta razón, y con la intención de alejarse de la perspectiva clínica de la realidad trans, se ha realizado una revisión sistemática de la literatura centrada en los cinco últimos años para conocer qué tipo de estudios se realizan con menores trans y cómo están vinculados al sistema educativo. Las búsquedas se han realizado utilizando las bases de datos Proquest, Scopus y Web of Science y se han seleccionado 39 artículos. Los resultados indican que, para superar el mal clima escolar que perciben las personas tras, son necesarias leyes, políticas educativas y reglamentos escolares que recojan expresamente esta realidad. La falta de formación del profesorado es evidente, aunque su actitud ante el alumnado trans puede marcar la diferencia. En consecuencia, se debe dotar al profesorado de herramientas para responder a las distintas realidades trans que se encuentran en las aulas.
The educational system is an important socializing agent. It is often regarded as solution to the social problems that society suffers. Nevertheless, at the same time the school setting is where trans people suffer a high discrimination, even knowing the implications that this entails in the mental health of these people. Therefore, with the intention of moving away from the clinical view of the trans reality, this updated systematic review focus on trans minors within the educational system. ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science databases were used to research the literature, and 39 articles were selected. Results indicate that in order to overcome the bad school climate perceived by trans students, laws, educational policies and school regulations that address this reality are necessary. A lack of teacher training is highlighted despite the fact that the attitude of teachers towards trans students can make a difference in their lives. Consequently, teachers should be provided with the tools to deal with different trans realities they encounter in their classrooms.

AB  - AgentAI represents a transformative approach within distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which autonomous agents work either individually or collaboratively in decentralized environments to address challenging problems. AgentAI enhances scalability, robustness, and flexibility by utilizing advanced communication, learning, and decision-making capabilities, making it integral to diverse applications in Industry 4.0. The ability of AI systems to interpret sensory data in open-world environments has seen significant advancements in recent years. This progress emphasizes the need to move beyond reductionist approaches and embrace more embodied and cohesive systems, which integrate foundational models into agent-driven actions. Existing surveys often focus on isolated domains or specific autonomy levels, lacking a cohesive analysis that spans the full spectrum of AgentAI development in Industry 4.0. This survey explicitly fills this gap by introducing a multi-domain taxonomy and by systematically analyzing both non-autonomous and fully autonomous AgentAI systems, offering a comprehensive synthesis not previously available in the literature. Additionally, the paper extends the discussion to Industry 5.0 and 6.0, exploring the evolution of AgentAI from automation to collaboration and, ultimately, to fully autonomous systems. This comprehensive analysis highlights the potential of AgentAI in driving industries toward a more efficient, sustainable, and adaptable future.

AB  - The twin transition, which involves the integration of digital and green transformations, is increasingly recognized as crucial for achieving a sustainable and competitive future. These intertwined transitions aim to decarbonize the economy by leveraging advanced digital technologies. Despite growing policy efforts to advance the twin transitions agenda and move toward a net-zero society by 2050, organizations face significant challenges in aligning digital innovations with sustainability goals. These challenges include the lack of a clear conceptualization, foundational success factors, and a structured series of activities needed to achieve the twin transition. These current shortcomings carry practical implications for implementing the twin transition and speak to the need for further research. Consequently, this study addresses these gaps by identifying the factors influencing the organizational implementation of the twin transition. To this end, we conduct a semi-structured literature review to synthesize current research on twin transitions. We provide a novel definition of twin transitions as “two parallel and mutually reinforcing digital and green transitions that amplify each other, leading to sustainable competitiveness for firms”. Moreover, our analysis delineates a twin transition implementation framework, which includes triggers, organizational practices, foundational success factors, and outcomes for organizations. Our findings indicate that twin transitions are manifested through two key organizational practices: the initial stage of twin transition practices and the practices to achieve maturity in the twin transition. Furthermore, the study contributes to the growing literature at the intersection of digitalization and sustainability, providing numerous suggestions for future research and highlighting the importance of focusing on a firm-centric research agenda.

AB  - We present insights into the geometry of the ratio consensus algorithm that lead to finite time distributed stopping criteria for the algorithm in higher dimension. In particular we show that the polytopes of network states indexed by time form a nested sequence. This monotonicity allows the construction of a distributed algorithm that terminates in finite time when applied to consensus problems in any dimension and guarantees the convergence of the consensus algorithm in norm, within any given tolerance. The practical utility of the algorithm is illustrated through MATLAB simulations.

AB  - The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis speed and robustness. This systematic review gives a comprehensive overview of few-shot learning methods for medical image analysis, aiming to establish a standard methodological pipeline for future research reference. With a particular emphasis on the role of meta-learning, we analysed 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023, conducting a risk of bias assessment and extracting relevant information, especially regarding the employed learning techniques. From this, we delineated a comprehensive methodological pipeline shared among all studies. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of the studies’ results concerning the clinical task and the meta-learning method employed while also presenting supplemental information such as imaging modalities and model robustness evaluation techniques. We discussed the findings of our analysis, providing a deep insight into the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods and the most promising approaches. Drawing on our investigation, we yielded recommendations on potential future research directions aiming to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.

AB  - This study explores the application of swarm robotics and swarm and evolutionary computing techniques in environmental management and sustainability, a highly specific and increasingly demanding niche research area. Through a bibliometric analysis of two collections of peer-reviewed papers, key trends and emerging research areas are identified. The first collection, comprising approximately 450 papers, focuses on specific applications of swarm robotics systems in environmental use cases, including swarms of UAVs, AUVs, and USVs, particularly in tasks such as ecological monitoring, agricultural management, and disaster response. This analysis highlights essential keyword clusters, with ``ecological restoration'' emerging as a significant topic, and ``agricultural robots'' and ``remote sensing'' as active frontiers. Building on this analysis, eight directions are proposed to address environmental challenges across five categories. The second collection, consisting of around 198 papers, examines the different swarm and evolutionary computing algorithms employed in this niche area, identifying ten significant research clusters. Notably, the ``secure incentive mechanism'' is a trending area, emphasizing the development of reliable and secure cooperative multi-robot systems. Recent methods in this cluster utilize deep reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithms to enhance cooperation efficiency. Five potential directions categorized into two main groups are explored to address security and reliability challenges within swarm robot systems in environmental tasks. The findings underscore the critical role of swarm robotics in environment-focused tasks such as ecosystem recovery and the importance of secure cooperation mechanisms, paving the way for advancements in agriculture, resource management, intelligent infrastructure, and urban systems.

AB  - Resumen
La psoriasis es una enfermedad autoinmune crónica que afecta a múltiples órganos, para la cual se buscan nuevas terapias con mejores resultados y menos efectos adversos en los pacientes. Este artículo presenta una revisión narrativa realizada en bases como Scopus, PubMed y ScienceDirect (2020–2024), con el objetivo de analizar cómo los hábitos de vida saludables influyen en las manifestaciones clínicas de la psoriasis mediante la regulación de la microbiota intestinal. Los resultados respaldan que los hábitos saludables, como una alimentación equilibrada y el manejo del estrés a través del ejercicio físico y estrategias que promuevan la salud mental, tienen gran impacto en la calidad de vida de los pacientes. Estos hábitos modulan la respuesta inflamatoria sistémica mediante el eje intestino-piel y regulan las citoquinas inflamatorias relacionadas con la psoriasis. Con base en la literatura revisada, se proponen intervenciones sobre estos hábitos como parte de terapias adyuvantes. En conclusión, los hábitos saludables mejoran la presentación y pronóstico de la psoriasis y requieren un enfoque integral y multidisciplinario que involucre a dermatólogos, nutricionistas, psicólogos y otros profesionales de la salud.
Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, for which new therapies are being sought to achieve better outcomes and fewer adverse effects in patients. This article presents a narrative review conducted in databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ScienceDirect (2020–2024), with the objective of analyzing how healthy lifestyle habits influence the clinical manifestations of psoriasis through the regulation of the gut microbiota. The results support those healthy habits, such as a balanced diet and stress management through physical exercise and strategies that promote mental health, have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. These habits modulate the systemic inflammatory response through the gut-skin axis and regulate inflammatory cytokines associated with psoriasis. Based on the reviewed literature, interventions focused on these habits are proposed as part of adjuvant therapies. In conclusion, healthy habits improve the clinical presentation and prognosis of psoriasis and require a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, nutritionists, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals.

AB  - Resumen
Este informe muestra el modo en que los resultados de la búsqueda en la literatura de estudios sobre la toma de decisiones relativa a la gestión sanitaria pueden ayudar a los anestesiólogos a mejorar la rotación del quirófano. Se realizó una búsqueda en la base de datos Scopus para obtener estudios relevantes sobre el incremento de la rotación del quirófano. Seguidamente se examinaron referencias y citas. Dicha búsqueda identificó las estrategias para reducir el tiempo de inactividad del quirófano, facilitar el solapamiento de cirugías, y optimizar la programación del quirófano. Los hallazgos clave muestran que reducir únicamente los tiempos controlados por la anestesia es insuficiente para añadir casos quirúrgicos extra dentro de un periodo laboral de ocho días, de manera fiable. En su lugar, los logros de productividad significativos se alcanzan gestionando los tiempos de rotación del quirófano, utilizando salas de inducción y revisando los flujos de trabajo para maximizar la eficiencia. Los estudios muestran que el solapamiento de cirugías y el uso estratégico de espacios adyacentes pueden incrementar significativamente el número de casos quirúrgicos realizados diariamente. La mayoría del crecimiento quirúrgico se ve impulsado por la acomodación de los cirujanos con baja carga de casos en múltiples especialidades. Facilitar el acceso del tiempo quirúrgico a dichos cirujanos, mediante la programación flexible y la resecuenciación de casos es esencial. Además, los anestesiólogos deberán implicarse en la programación diaria del quirófano y la secuenciación de casos, particularmente en los dos días previos a la cirugía. Los objetivos duales son el incremento del uso del quirófano y la reducción de los tiempos de espera del paciente. Dichos resultados del informe de casos de gestión destacan la importancia de las prácticas de gestión del quirófano basadas en la evidencia, así como la implicación proactiva de los anestesiólogos en las decisiones sobre programación, para mejorar la rotación quirúrgica.
This report shows how the results of a literature search for studies on healthcare management decision-making can help anaesthesiologists improve operating room (OR) turnover. The Scopus database was searched to obtain relevant studies on increasing surgery turnover. References and citations were then examined. The search identified strategies to reduce OR downtime time, facilitate overlapping surgeries, and optimize OR scheduling. Key findings show that reducing anaesthesia-controlled times alone is insufficient to reliably add extra surgical cases within an 8-hour workday. Instead, significant productivity gains are achieved by managing OR turnover times, using induction rooms, and revising workflows to maximize efficiency. Studies show that overlapping surgeries and strategic use of adjacent spaces can significantly increase the number of surgical cases performed daily. Most surgical growth is driven by accommodating low caseload surgeons across multiple specialties. Facilitating OR time access for these surgeons through flexible scheduling and re-sequencing of cases is crucial. Additionally, anaesthesiologists should be engaged in daily OR scheduling and case sequencing, particularly within 2 days of surgery. The dual goals are to increase OR utilization and reduce patient wait times. These results from the management case report underscores the importance of evidence-based OR management practices and proactive involvement of anaesthesiologists in scheduling decisions to enhance surgical turnover.

AB  - Summary
Brown seaweeds are keystone species of coastal ecosystems, often forming extensive underwater forests, and are under considerable threat from climate change. In this study, analysis of multiple genomes has provided insights across the entire evolutionary history of this lineage, from initial emergence, through later diversification of the brown algal orders, down to microevolutionary events at the genus level. Emergence of the brown algal lineage was associated with a marked gain of new orthologous gene families, enhanced protein domain rearrangement, increased horizontal gene transfer events, and the acquisition of novel signaling molecules and key metabolic pathways, the latter notably related to biosynthesis of the alginate-based extracellular matrix, and halogen and phlorotannin biosynthesis. We show that brown algal genome diversification is tightly linked to phenotypic divergence, including changes in life cycle strategy and zoid flagellar structure. The study also showed that integration of large viral genomes has had a significant impact on brown algal genome content throughout the emergence of the lineage.

AB  - Stroke survivors often suffer from upper limb spasticity and impaired motor function. This review seeks to: (1) explore the efficacy of neural mobilization, particularly using the Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test 1 (ULNT1), in modulating electromyographic (EMG) activity of muscles; (2) examine its role in reducing spasticity and improving functional outcomes; and (3) outline the current state of knowledge, identifying existing gaps and directions for future research. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on studies that implemented ULNT1 and EMG analysis in post-stroke patients. The included studies varied in participant characteristics, methodologies, and outcome measures. The results demonstrated that neural mobilization has the potential to reduce EMG activity in spastic muscles and modify pain perceptions. However, results regarding the improvement of range of motion and functional outcomes were mixed. Neural mobilization and electromyographic analysis show promise for improving post-stroke rehabilitation. However, further research is required to confirm these benefits, with more rigorous methodologies and larger sample sizes.
Resumen
Los sobrevivientes de un accidente cerebrovascular a menudo sufren de espasticidad en el miembro superior y disfunción motora. Esta revisión tiene como objetivos: 1) explorar la eficacia de la movilización neural, particularmente mediante el Test neurodinámico del miembro superior 1 (ULNT1), en la modulación de la actividad electromiográfica de los músculos; 2) examinar su papel en la reducción de la espasticidad y en la mejora de los resultados funcionales y 3) delinear el estado actual del conocimiento, identificando las brechas existentes y las direcciones para futuras investigaciones. Se llevó a cabo una revisión exhaustiva de la literatura, centrándose en estudios que implementaron el ULNT1 y el análisis electromiográfico en pacientes tras un ictus. Los estudios incluidos variaron en características de los participantes, metodologías y medidas de resultado. Los resultados demostraron que la movilización neural tiene el potencial de reducir la actividad electromiográfica en músculos espásticos y modificar las percepciones del dolor. Sin embargo, los resultados respecto a la mejora del rango de movimiento y de los resultados funcionales fueron mixtos. La movilización neural y el análisis electromiográfico muestran un potencial prometedor para mejorar la rehabilitación tras un ictus. No obstante, se requiere más investigación con metodologías más rigurosas y tamaños de muestra más grandes para confirmar estos beneficios.

AB  - As the ability to interpret and anticipate artificial intelligence (AI) research trends is becoming increasingly important, previous studies have highlighted the potential of computational literature review (CLR) within the AI domain. However, existing approaches may be limited in understanding domain-specific terminologies and complex contexts and delivering timely, forward-looking insights within the rapidly evolving AI landscape. As a remedy, this study proposes a systematic approach for effectively exploring AI landscapes using AI-specific pre-trained language model (PLM)-based topic modeling, and emergingness analysis. We newly adopt the PapersWithCode database, considering its credibility based on source codes and venue information, human-crafted tags (e.g., methods), and periodic updatability. The core components of the proposed approach are: (1) constructing a dynamic AI landscape to capture time-varying trends using AI-specific PLMs and unsupervised clustering; (2) assessing the emergingness of individual AI topics to deliver anticipatory insights; and (3) developing an interactive topic evolution map that traces the temporal transitions of key topics from their predecessors to successors. A case study of 18,870 papers on scaled dot-product attention mechanisms demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in understanding what AI topics can be identified as emerging, along with their defining characteristics, and the evolutionary pathways of a given target topic. Our systematic process and quantitative outcomes are expected to serve as complementary tools for strategic foresight and AI trend monitoring while contributing to academia by proposing the integration of new data sources and perspectives into AI-specific CLR.

AB  - The multifunctionality of forest systems calls for appropriately complex modelling approaches to capture social and ecosystem dynamics. Using a social-ecological systems framework, we review the functionality of 31 existing agent-based models applied to managed forests. Several applications include advanced cognitive and emotional decision-making, crucial for understanding complex sustainability challenges. However, far from all demonstrate representation of key elements in a social-ecological system like direct interactions, and dynamic representations of social and ecological processes. We conclude that agent-based approaches are adequately complex for simulating both social and ecological subsystems, but highlight three main avenues for further development: i) robust methodological standards for calibration and validation of agent-based approaches; ii) modelling of agent learning, adaptive governance and feedback loops; iii) coupling to ecological models such as dynamic vegetation models or species distribution models. We round-off by providing a set of questions to support social-ecological systems modelling choices.

AB  - Farm level scale policy analysis is receiving increased attention due to a changing agricultural policy orientation. Agent based models (ABM) are farm level models that have appeared in the end of 1990's, having several differences from traditional farm level models, like the consideration of interactions between farms, the way markets are simulated, the inclusion of agents' bounded rationality, behavioral heterogeneity, etc. Considering the potential of ABMs to complement existing farm level models and that they are a relatively recent approach with a growing demand for new models and modelers, we perform a systematic literature review to (a) consolidate in a consistent and transparent way the literature status on policy evaluation ABMs; (b) examine the status of the literature regarding model transparency; the modeling of the agents' decision processes; and the creation of the initial population.

This study aims to offer a bibliometric and coding analysis of blockchain articles published in the accounting, auditing and accountability fields.
Design/methodology/approach
The data were collected using the Scopus database and a bibliometric and qualitative coding analysis with the keywords “blockchain” and “accounting” or “auditing” or “accountability.” Of the 514 initial sources, 93 peer-reviewed papers, book chapters and conference proceedings in the areas of business, management and accounting were finally selected. Nonscientific sources such as nonpeer-reviewed books and white papers were excluded.
Findings
This study reveals a promising and multidisciplinary field of research dominated by scholars and less by practitioners. Qualitative research, especially discourse analysis, is the most used method among authors. This study gives some useful insights about blockchain's definition and characteristics, business models, processes involved, connection with other technologies and relationships with accounting theories. Among the most interesting insights, the results confirm that technology as an external force can create an intersection among several research areas: accounting, auditing, accountability, business, management, computer science and engineering fields. Finally, in terms of research themes, although blockchain has a clear effect on auditing accounting, the links with the area of accountability are less clear and validated.
Originality/value
This study highlights the current state of the field, combining methodological approaches and providing valuable future research insights. Additionally, it is also a starting point for professionals to fully understand blockchain's characteristics and potential with a constructive and systemic approach.

AB  - Recently, the civilian applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining more interest in several domains. Due to operational costs, safety concerns, and legal regulations, Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is commonly used to design models and conduct tests. This has resulted in numerous research works addressing ABS in civilian UAV applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ABS contribution in civilian UAV applications by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the relevant research in the previous ten years. Following the SLR methodology, this objective is broken down into several research questions aiming to (i) understand the evolution of ABS use in civilian UAV applications and identify the related hot research topics, (ii) identify the underlying artificial intelligence systems used in the literature, (iii) understand how and when ABS is integrated in broader and more complex internet of things & ubiquitous computing environments, and (iv) identity the communication technologies, tools, and evaluation techniques used to design, implement, and test the proposed ABS models. From the SLR results, key research directions are highlighted including problems related to autonomy, explainability, security, flight duration, integration within smart cities, regulations, and validation & verification of the UAV behavior.

To review the available evidence on nurses’ attitudes to and knowledge about euthanasia.
Methods
A literature review was carried out in the databases: PubMed (including Medline), CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CUIDEN, with inclusive terms of nurses’ attitudes and knowledge regarding euthanasia both nationally and internationally. The selection criteria were articles in Spanish, English, Catalan or French published from January 2012 to September 2019 and studies that analysed the nurses’ attitudes and knowledge regarding euthanasia and articles that were full available for analysis.
Results
Initially a total of 566 articles were found, and finally 8 met the inclusion criteria of the research question in the review. The total number of nurses participating in the studies was 3,571. Most of the nurses, both at international and national level, have a positive attitude towards the legalization of euthanasia; however, all studies report a lack in nurses’ knowledge on the specific theme of euthanasia.
Discussion
The results show that nurses describe their attitude as positive towards the practice of euthanasia. In terms of knowledge, nurses reported the need to have more specific training on this subject is conclusive. In addition, this review provides a global and current vision that can serve as a necessary starting point for further work and progress in nurse training and for future research.

AB  - Soon after the pandemic outbreak in 2020, it was proposed that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 may explain most of COVID-19’s manifestations. Therefore, manipulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by using well known and commercialized blockers of its classical arm or by repurposing new stimulators of the alternative RAS pathway in clinical development was seen as a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this therapeutic approach had previously shown significant promise in the treatment of other respiratory viral respiratory infections and forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Consequently, several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were launched to test the efficacy of rebalancing the RAS to reduce the severity of COVID-19. While most of these trials produced neutral results, certain studies reached their primary endpoints. In the present collaborative review, sponsors and main investigators of some of these trials attempt to reach a consensus regarding their clinical significance and which factors influenced their differing outcomes. The knowledge gained through the careful analysis of these RCTs of RAS modulators in patients with severe COVID-19 may prove useful for other forms of acute lung injury.

AB  - In the last two decades, cities have embraced advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, information and communications technology-based systems, internet of things, and big data analytics as a key component of the urban environment. These ‘smart cities’ use technological and digital solutions to enhance quality of life, increase access to and utilisation of urban services, and improve resource management. However, adopting advanced technologies is fraught with uncertainty and unpredictability which presents several challenges in designing inclusive smart city policies. In this study, we identify and advance synergies needed for designing policies for inclusive smart cities. We analyse policy design components of Singapore's Smart Nation program – goals, instruments, and their interactions in policy packages. We demonstrate how policymakers pursue policy goals for inclusive development while balancing technological transformation. Results indicate the need for developing adaptive spaces for policy design in smart cities that respond and adjust to the uncertainties associated with adopting advanced technologies while retaining the desired policy objectives for inclusive development. These spaces are shown to have a large variation in policy instruments combined with synergistic and facilitative interactions between them. Our findings further the discussion on adaptive policy design and their role in smart city governance.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is among the advanced technologies driving significant transformations in the manufacturing sector. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in scholarly publications focusing on AI applications in manufacturing in recent years. This paper investigates the diverse applications of AI in manufacturing through a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature. The study employs metadata analysis, including titles, keywords, authors, and affiliations, to investigate regional variations and thematic trends in the field. Keywords are first analyzed for significance and categorized into 11 distinct categories. Significant keywords specific to each country are then identified to highlight individual research areas. Topic modeling is utilized to uncover nine key topics and their respective proportions across countries. Finally, clustering based on topic distributions identifies countries with similar research interests within AI applications in manufacturing. The theoretical implications emphasize the need to develop interdisciplinary approaches that reflect AI’s transformative role in reshaping manufacturing. As AI drives shifts in technology, economics, and sustainability, it calls for an integration of new concepts like AI-led smart manufacturing and global innovation ecosystems, which are essential for understanding the broader societal and economic impacts. These shifts also underscore the importance of examining global technological convergence and international research collaborations.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is a central strategy to strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector over the next years. Nevertheless, there is a lack of common understanding of Industry 4.0 and tools to help companies’ transformation to Industry 4.0, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these research gaps, this study proposes a framework to characterise and evaluate Industry 4.0 scenarios to aid companies’ transition towards Industry 4.0. For this, a design science (multi-methodological) approach is adopted, including an Industry 4.0 use case survey, modelling and simulation and two proof-of-concept cases developed in collaboration with a Canadian college centre for technology transfer. The results indicate that the proposed framework can help companies identify Industry 4.0 scenarios more intuitively to assist project conception, portfolio selection and planning during Industry 4.0 roadmap development. Finally, the results of this study suggest that Industry 4.0 can be implemented incrementally while companies increase their digital capabilities and maturity.

AB  - Objective
Restoring noncarious cervical lesions are challenging to clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the clinical performance/longevity of glass ionomer cements (GIC) and composite resins (CR) used for noncarious cervical lesions (NCCL) through a systematic review and meta-analysis (MA).
Data
Randomized and controlled clinical trials and nonrandomized clinical trials, which compared the clinical performance/longevity of CR and GIC (conventional and/or resin-modified) in the treatment of NCCL, were included.
Source
The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Seven MAs were performed considering (1) the clinical performance of the parameters in common: retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, secondary caries, color, anatomic form, surface texture and (2) a follow-up time of 12, 24 and 36 months. The prevalence of successful restorations and the total number of restorations per clinical parameter/follow-up time were used to calculate the relative risk (95% CI).
Study selection
After screening of the studies, 13 studies were used for quantitative synthesis. The risk difference (CI 95%, α, I2) between GIC and CR for anatomic form was 0.00 (-0.02, 0.02; p = 0.83; 0%); for color was -0.02 (-0.08, 0.04; p = 0.48; 80%); for surface texture was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02; p = 0.31; 63%); for secondary caries was -0.00 (-0.01, 0.01; p = 0.87; 0%); for marginal discoloration was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.03; p = 0.23; 3%); for marginal adaptation was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.04; p = 0.34; 32%) and for retention was 0.07 (0.02, 0.12; p = 0.003; 76%).
Conclusion
GIC showed a clinical performance significantly higher than CR in regard to retention, whereas for the other parameters, GIC was similar to CR.
Clinical significance
NCCLs is increasingly prevalent among the population and this type of lesion causing defects in the tooth that affect not only aesthetics but also everyday habits, such as drinking, eating and teeth brushing, due to the sensitivity these lesions cause.

AB  - Acne fulminans is a severe and rare form of inflammatory acne. Lesion severity and subsequent scarring has a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. We conducted a narrative review of the literature on acne fulminans based on a search for relevant English- and Spanish-language articles published in Medline. We included case reports and case series. The main aim was to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with acne fulminans. A secondary aim was to determine whether quality of life was affected by the site or extent of lesions. We reviewed 91 articles describing 212 cases of acne fulminans. The mean age of the patients (91.94% male) was 16.6 years. A personal and family history of acne vulgaris was reported for 97.63% and 54.90% of patients, respectively. A trigger was identified in 44.79% of cases. The main cause was pharmacologic (96.63%) and the main drug isotretinoin (65.28%). The sites most often affected were the face (89.31%), the posterior trunk (77.86%), and the anterior trunk (74.81%). The predominant disease subtype was acne fulminans with systemic symptoms (59.12%), which were mostly general (97.06%). Systemic corticosteroids were the most widely used treatment (81.03%). The impact of the disease on quality of life was reported for two patients. In conclusion, acne fulminans mainly affects the face and trunk of male adolescents with a history of acne vulgaris. The main subtype was acne fulminans with systemic symptoms, and most patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The effect of acne fulminans on quality of life is under-reported.
Resumen
El acné fulminans (AF) es una forma rara y grave de acné inflamatorio. La intensidad de las lesiones cutáneas y las cicatrices secundarias impactan negativamente en la calidad de vida. Presentamos una revisión narrativa de casos de AF publicados en Medline. Se incluyeron artículos escritos en lengua castellana o inglesa, que reportasen casos aislados o series de casos de AF, de los que se recogieron variables clínico-demográficas. El objetivo principal de la revisión fue describir las características clínico-demográficas del AF. Secundariamente se pretendió determinar si la localización o la extensión lesional repercuten en la calidad de vida. Se revisaron 212 casos de AF incluidos en 91 artículos (edad media: 16,6 años, 91,94% varones); 97,63% de los pacientes presentaron acné previo al brote de AF y 54,90% contaba con antecedentes familiares de acné. En 44,79% existió un factor desencadenante de AF (98,63% farmacológico: 65,28% isotretinoína). Las localizaciones más habitualmente afectas fueron cara (89,31%), tronco posterior (77,86%) y anterior (74,81%). El subtipo predominante fue el AF asociado a síntomas sistémicos (59,12%). Entre los síntomas sistémicos destacó la sintomatología general (97,06%). El tratamiento más prevalente fue la corticoterapia sistémica (81,03%). La repercusión del AF en la calidad de vida se reportó en dos pacientes. Como conclusiones, el AF predomina en los varones adolescentes con antecedentes de acné vulgar, afectando fundamentalmente la cara y el tronco. La forma más frecuente es el AF con síntomas sistémicos. Para su tratamiento, los corticoides sistémicos son los fármacos más frecuentemente empleados. La repercusión del AF en la calidad de vida está infrarreportada.

AB  - Resumen
La cesárea es una de las cirugías más comúnmente realizadas en obstetricia y consiste en la extracción de un neonato a través de una incisión abdominal y uterina. Esta intervención podría provocar diferentes secuelas, como el dolor, que puede ser tratado mediante técnicas de fisioterapia. El objetivo de este trabajo es analizar la literatura existente para conocer cuáles son los efectos de la fisioterapia en el dolor tras la cesárea. Se llevó a cabo una búsqueda bibliográfica en las bases de datos PudMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Scopus, Web of Science y Enfermería, Fisioterapia y Podología (ENFISPO). Se emplearon los términos de búsqueda «pain», «cesarean section», «physiotherapy», «physical therapy» y «physical therapy modalities». Se limitaron los estudios a ensayos clínicos aleatorizados publicados en inglés o español. De los 220 resultados iniciales, se escogieron 12 artículos para su análisis. Las terapias que se llevaron a cabo fueron variadas, incluyendo electroterapia, masoterapia y crioterapia para analizar diferentes variables. La fisioterapia es beneficiosa en el control del dolor de las pacientes tras una cesárea a través de técnicas como la estimulación nerviosa eléctrica transcutánea (TENS). Otras terapias como la masoterapia y la crioterapia parecen obtener algunas mejoras, pero no se puede concluir que tengan beneficios significativos.
Cesarean section is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in obstetrics and involves the removal of a neonate through an abdominal and uterine incision. This intervention can cause different consequences, such as pain, which can be treated using physiotherapy techniques. The objective of this work is to analyze the existing literature to know what the effects of physiotherapy are on pain after cesarean section. A bibliographic search was carried out in the databases PudMed, Cinahl, Medline, PEDro, Scopus, Web of Science and ENFISPO. The search terms «Pain», «Cesarean Section», «Physiotherapy», «Physical Therapy» and «Physical Therapy Modalities» were used. Studies were limited to randomized clinical trials published in English or Spanish. Of the 220 initial results, 12 articles were chosen for analysis. The therapies carried out were varied, including electrotherapy, massage therapy and cryotherapy to analyze different variables. Physiotherapy is beneficial in controlling pain in patients after a cesarean section through techniques such as TENS. Other therapies such as massage therapy and cryotherapy seem to obtain some improvements, but it cannot be concluded that they have significant benefits.

AB  - The use of alternative renewable energy sources such as those obtained from biomass is an excellent alternative to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere, generating high-calorific biofuels. Olive oil is a product of global importance, with Brazil being one of the largest consumers. Although the country is a major importer of olive oil, its production is low. However, it generates large quantities of by-products, such as olive pomace, with little explored energy potential and often discarded. Therefore, this work aims to show the possible routes of conversion of this biomass into biomethane and biohydrogen, and also determining its bibliometric data from the scientific literature regarding the use of this biomass for energy purposes. The estimated production of biogas through the use of olive pomace generated during olive oil production amounted to 716,000 m3/year in Rio Grande do Sul. On the othe hand, the maximum estimated biomethane and hydrogen production for the state was equal to 450,000 m3/year and 110 tons per year, respectively, generating 1.800 MWh of electricity. The results will facilitate quantification of the current state of research and development focus in the area of utilization of olive pomace for energy. This means that, with regard to trends, research gaps and publication activity, this study can pinpoint those areas that still require further investigation and development of new technologies. Additionally, this work shows that olive pomace contains considerable potential to be used as a feedstock for renewable energy generation in Brazil and could potentially play a significant role in meeting Brazil's renewable energy demand via biomethane and biohydrogen. This strategy comes handy not only with international pushes to shift to clean energy but also provides a solution to the waste management in the olive oil production industries.

AB  - A 21st-century bibliometric analysis was carried out to reflect on the effects of microencapsulation technology on the anthocyanin stability. From 172 articles retrieved, there was an increase in the number of articles published from 2012 to 2021 and in the number of patents during the 22 years. Brazil (n = 52, 30 %) and Mexico (n = 16, 10 %) were the countries with the highest number of publications, followed by United States, China, Colombia, Romania, Poland, Italy, and Iran. Thirteen clusters were established, with 2–7 authors related to each other. Nineteen recent articles were for analysis of the anthocyanin sources, microencapsulation process (technique and wall material), pH values and water activity (aw), and effects or applications in model systems. Among the trends, tests on the use of autochthonous wall material stand out, that is, one that has a composition in biopolymers originating from the original source of anthocyanin extraction (core material), such as pectin, starches, proteins, and lipids.

Se realizó una búsqueda en las bases de datos Medline, Web of Science y Scopus, utilizando los términos MeSH «depression», «pregnancy», «postpartum» y «exercise». Se analizaron 15 estudios en los que el protocolo de intervención más utilizado fue el ejercicio estructurado supervisado de naturaleza aeróbico, de fuerza, estiramientos, de relajación y de suelo pélvico. También se aplicó actividad física no reglada basada en actividades de la vida diaria como caminar. Se observaron mejoras significativas en las variables indicativas de depresión y otros factores de bienestar psicológico. Por lo tanto, el ejercicio ha demostrado ser un método válido para mejorar la depresión durante el embarazo y el posparto. Los hallazgos en este trabajo podrían suponer un método más de tratamiento en la depresión durante estas etapas.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the current scientific literature on the effects of exercise on depression during pregnancy and postpartum. A search was conducted in the Medline, Web of Science and Scopus databases using the MeSH terms “depression”, “pregnancy”, “postpartum” and “exercise”. Fifteen studies were analysed in which the most commonly used intervention protocol was supervised structured aerobic exercise, strength, stretching, relaxation, and pelvic floor exercise. Non-regulated physical activity based on activities of daily living such as walking was also applied. Significant improvements were observed in variables indicative of depression and other factors of psychological well-being. Therefore, exercise has been shown to be a valid method to improve depression during pregnancy and postpartum. The findings in this work could represent a further method of treatment for depression during these stages.

Objetivos
El objetivo principal es identificar qué tratamientos de fisioterapia se utilizan para mejorar la postura en pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson (EP). Los objetivos secundarios son determinar cuáles de estos tratamientos son más eficaces e identificar qué efectos produce la reeducación de la postura en pacientes con EP.
Estrategia de búsqueda
La búsqueda de información se realizó entre febrero y marzo del 2015 en 9 bases de datos: Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline, PEDro, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, SciELO, IME y ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global.
Resultados
Se han seleccionado 7 estudios, cuyas intervenciones fueron: estimulación magnética, reeducación postural global (RPG), terapia acuática, entrenamiento de la marcha en tapiz rodante y sesiones de fisioterapia individuales o grupales. Varios estudios presentaron diferentes riesgos de sesgo y las muestras poblacionales fueron escasas (entre 15 y 54 participantes).
Conclusiones
Las intervenciones más eficaces para mejorar la postura en pacientes con EP utilizadas desde la fisioterapia son la RPG y el entrenamiento de la marcha cuesta abajo en tapiz rodante. La RPG también mejorara la marcha, el equilibrio y la movilidad del tronco. Futuras investigaciones deberían estudiar los efectos de las intervenciones que pueden mejorar la postura en la EP con muestras poblacionales más amplias y limitando, en la medida de lo posible, los riesgos de sesgo.

AB  - The interaction between excited states of a closed-shell chromophore and a nearby free radical species gives rise to spin-coupled doublet states, namely singdoublet and tripdoublet, as well as a quartet state. This coupling facilitates transitions that are otherwise spin-forbidden, thereby enhancing intersystem crossing and influencing luminescence and non-radiative decay pathways. In this chapter, we explore these interactions using multistate density functional theory (MSDFT). By employing a minimal active space (MAS) comprising just ten determinant configurations, MSDFT effectively captures local and charge-transfer excitations with inclusion of correlation effects. MSDFT extends the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory from the ground state to encompass all electronic states, underscoring the potential for developing computationally efficient methods to study excited states. Numerical results demonstrate that MSDFT accurately reproduces both qualitative trends and quantitative excited-state energies, in accord with previous studies using extended multistate complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2). The work explores energy changes along a reaction path from the D0/D1 minimum energy crossing intersection to the D2/D3 crossing in the exciplex formed by 10-methylphenothiazine and a dicarboximide electron acceptor linked to the stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO).

AB  - Resumen
La posmenopausia es el periodo que sigue a la menopausia, donde la mujer experimenta una serie de cambios, entre los que destacan los síntomas vasomotores, la dificultad para dormir, el bajo estado de ánimo y la sequedad vaginal. Estos se asocian a un deterioro de la salud física, mental y sexual, lo que disminuye la calidad de vida de las mujeres. La fisioterapia como alternativa terapéutica presenta grandes beneficios para aliviar estos síntomas, por lo que con esta revisión se pretende recopilar la literatura científica más actual para evaluar sus efectos en la calidad de vida de las mujeres posmenopáusicas. Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica durante el mes de diciembre de 2023 en las bases de datos PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library y PEDro. Se emplearon los descriptores «Physical Therapy Modalities», «Menopause», «Climacteric» y «Quality of Life». Se incluyeron ensayos clínicos aleatorizados que estuviesen publicados en los últimos 6 años en inglés o español. Tras aplicar los criterios de elegibilidad, se obtuvieron 9 resultados. Los estudios escogidos desarrollaron distintas intervenciones de fisioterapia, entre las que destacan diferentes programas de ejercicio, sesiones de yoga o de pilates, masaje craneofacial e incluso programas psicoeducativos. En todos ellos la principal variable analizada fue la calidad de vida. Las distintas modalidades de fisioterapia parecen mejorar los síntomas y, con ello, la calidad de vida de las mujeres en la etapa posmenopáusica.
Postmenopause is the period following menopause, where women experience a series of changes, including vasomotor symptoms, difficulty sleeping, low mood, and vaginal dryness. These are associated with a deterioration in physical, mental and sexual health, which decreases women's quality of life. Physiotherapy as a therapeutic alternative has great benefits to relieve these symptoms, so this review aims to compile the most current scientific literature to evaluate its effects on the quality of life of postmenopausal women. A bibliographic search was carried out during the month of December 2023 in the PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PEDro databases. The descriptors «Physical Therapy Modalities», «Menopause», «Climacteric» and «Quality of Life» were used. Randomized clinical trials that were published in the last 6 years in English or Spanish were included. After applying the eligibility criteria, 9 results were obtained. The chosen studies developed different physiotherapy interventions, including different exercise programs, yoga or Pilates sessions, craniofacial massage and even psycho-educational programs. In all of them, the main variable analyzed was quality of life. The different modalities of physical therapy seem to improve symptoms and, therefore, the quality of life of women in the postmenopausal stage.

AB  - Normal ocular microbiota is composed of different Gram-negative and positive bacterial communities that act as commensals on the ocular surface. An imbalance in the homeostasis of the native species or dysbiosis triggers functional alterations that can eventually lead to ocular conditions, indicating the use of contact lenses as the most relevant predisposing factor. Through a bibliographic review that added scientific articles published between 2018 and 2022, the relationship between healthy ocular microbiota and dysbiosis associated with the use of contact lenses that trigger ocular conditions was analyzed. The ocular microbiota in healthy individuals is mainly composed of bacteria from the phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. These bacterial communities associated with the use of contact lenses develop dysbiosis, observing an increase in certain genera such as Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., which under normal conditions are commensals of the ocular surface, but as their abundance is increased, they condition the appearance of various ocular conditions such as corneal infiltrative events, bacterial keratitis and corneal ulcer. These pathologies tend to evolve rapidly, which, added to late detection and treatment, can lead to a poor visual prognosis. It is suggested that professionals in the ophthalmology area learn about the composition of the communities of microorganisms that make up this ocular microbiota, in order to correctly distinguish and identify the causative agent, thereby providing a adequate and effective treatment to the user.
Resumen
La microbiota ocular normal está compuesta por diferentes comunidades bacterianas Gram negativas y positivas que actúan en la superficie ocular como comensales. Un desequilibrio en la homeostasis de las especies nativas o disbiosis desencadena alteraciones funcionales que eventualmente pueden conllevar afecciones oculares, señalándose al uso de lentes de contacto como el factor predisponentes más relevante. Mediante una revisión bibliográfica que incluyó artículos científicos publicados entre el año 2018 y 2022, se analizó la relación entre la microbiota ocular sana, la disbiosis asociada al uso de lentes de contacto que desencadena afecciones oculares. La microbiota ocular en individuos sanos, se compone principalmente por bacterias de los filos: Proteobacterias, Actinobacteria y Firmicutes. Estas comunidades bacterianas al verse asociadas al uso de lentes de contacto desarrollaron disbiosis, observándose un aumento de ciertos géneros como Staphylococcus spp. y Pseudomonas spp., que en condiciones normales son comensales de la superficie ocular, pero al estar aumentada su abundancia condicionan la aparición de diversas afecciones oculares como eventos infiltrativos corneales, queratitis y úlcera corneal bacterianas. Dichas patologías tienden a evolucionar de manera rápida, lo que, sumado a una detección y tratamiento tardíos, puede desencadenar en un pronóstico visual deficiente. Se sugiere que, frente a diversas afecciones de la superficie ocular, los profesionales en el área de oftalmología conozcan la composición de las comunidades de microorganismos que conforman esta microbiota ocular, de manera de distinguir e identificar correctamente el agente causal y con ello brindar un tratamiento adecuado y efectivo al usuario.

KW  - Structured literature review
AB  - This study reviews 128 empirical studies on mandatory auditor rotation (MAR) in light of the long-standing debate on the effectiveness of MAR and the different regulatory choices made worldwide over time. A structured literature review was conducted to address three research questions. How has empirical research on MAR developed from 2000 to 2022? What is the focus and critique of the empirical research on MAR? What is the future of MAR empirical research? The findings reveal growing empirical evidence on MAR. However, this evidence is fragmented and country-based. Scholars have primarily focused on audit firm rotation rather than audit partner rotation. While quantitative research based on archival data predominates, survey questionnaires prevail in a few regions. Evidence on how MAR impacts auditor independence, the auditor–client relationship, and audit market concentration is scant, whereas audit quality is the most investigated research question. Nonetheless, assessing whether MAR benefits audit quality remains challenging because the research outcomes depend on the research question, rotation type, research method, and regulations enforced in the empirical setting. Based on this comprehensive and rigorous overview of worldwide MAR empirical research, knowledge gaps are underlined, avenues for future research are suggested, and warnings are issued to shareholders and policymakers.

KW  - Bibliometric analysis
KW  - Systematic literature review
AB  - With the advent of aviation deregulation, the rapid development of low-cost carriers (LCCs) has posed significant competitive pressures to established airlines, particularly full-service carriers (FSCs). In response to these challenges, FSCs have undergone substantial operational strategy reforms. One such response has been adopting the airline-within-airline (AWA) strategy, wherein FSCs establish subsidiary LCCs. These subsidiary LCCs are either utilised as fighting brands to compete with major LCC competitors directly or to expand the market coverage of the parent airline. However, not all subsidiary LCCs have succeeded, and their impacts on the market competition structure and outcomes have varied significantly. We aim to provide a thorough review of existing studies and address a series of vital questions, including the market impact of AWA, incentives for adopting such strategy, and the successful operation patterns of subsidiary LCCs under the AWA framework. To ensure the breadth and depth of our review, we construct an article database and employ semantic analysis to capture relevant studies' titles, keywords, and abstracts. We summarise and report the adopted research methodologies, aviation markets studied, keywords and author co-occurrence networks, as well as research trends and gaps in previous literature. Through bibliometric analysis, we identify the importance of subsidiary autonomy and coordinating labour policy between low-cost and full-service group members. Meanwhile, the changing dynamic of airline competition requires flexible adjustment in route configuration, and up-to-date empirical investigation is necessary to understand airline group strategy. The significant disruption brought by the COVID-19 pandemic has not been detailly studied for AWA. Our literature review could provide insights into the current state of research in this area while also identifying future research opportunities.

AB  - The absence of studies on the tropospheric reaction mechanism of unsaturated ketones increases the difficulty for the accurate assessment of their environmental fate. Herein, the gaseous and aqueous chemistry of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) with ·Cl and ·OH, as well as the ensuing radical (e.g., chloroperoxy and hydroxyperoxy radicals) reactions are investigated from a theoretical perspective. A new pathway for the formation of alkoxyl radicals from peroxyl radicals is presumed. The reaction activity of alkoxyl radicals takes the order of β–scission > with O2 > with H2O > Russell mechanism. The aqueous environment shows the negative solvent effect on these two systems. The “polarization” of the proportion of the addition and abstraction reactions is intensified by the solvent effect. Although the rate constants kMVK-Cl > kMVK-OH > kMVK-O3, ·OH-induced MVK reaction is still the dominant sink of MVK. If the effect of ·Cl is ignored, the atmospheric lifetimes of MVK will be overestimated by 12% and even more. The detailed reaction mechanisms and product information for the reaction of ·Cl with MVK are calculated for the first time. Low volatility oxygenated products (such as organic acids, α-dicarbonyls, and some C4 multifunctional molecules) produced in the title reactions may be an important bridge between unsaturated ketone and aqSOA. An increased eco-toxicity can occur from MVK to its degradation products in the ·Cl-MVK system, highlighting the necessity in the research of LMW unsaturated hydrocarbon on environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Introduction
Gaining practical experience in health professions education is a significant challenge. Simulation-based training has emerged as a key solution to this issue, but the high costs associated with advanced equipment and software limit accessibility for many institutions. Hence, to close this gap, this study aims to map the research field of low-cost simulation in health professions education through a bibliometric analysis.
Methods
Utilizing a bibliometric study design, we analyzed publications from 2003 to 2022 in the Scopus Database, in accordance to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. Publications discussing low-cost simulation in English were included. Data points such as research design, study location, and outcomes were extracted. The Scival Platform and VosViewer were used to analyze publication trends, prolific institutions, authors, journals, and conceptual and intellectual structure.
Results
The study found an increase in low-cost simulation research from 2003 to 2022, with significant growth after 2015. Observational studies predominated (68.57%), with general surgery being the most studied specialty. Less than half of the studies reported cost details, and only 2 compared the low-cost model with a standard. The United States led in scientific production, with notable collaboration networks. The keyword co-occurrence and co-citation analyses highlighted 4 main clusters in low-cost simulation research, emphasizing surgical training.
Conclusions
This investigation highlights the expanding interest in low-cost simulation to enhance access to hands-on training in health professions education, especially under financial constraints. However, the research field requires further development, particularly in validating these models against their more expensive counterparts. Such validation is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness and comparability of low-cost simulation.
Resumen
Introducción
Adquirir experiencia práctica en la formación de las profesiones sanitarias es un reto importante. El aprendizaje basado en simulación ha surgido como una solución a este problema, pero los elevados costes asociados a los equipos y programas avanzados limitan la accesibilidad de muchas instituciones. De ahí la necesidad de cerrar esta brecha. Este estudio pretende delimitar el campo de investigación de la simulación de bajo costo en la formación de las profesiones sanitarias mediante un análisis bibliométrico.
Métodos
Utilizando un diseño de estudio bibliométrico, analizamos las publicaciones de 2003 a 2022 en la base de datos Scopus, siguiendo las directrices de Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020. Se incluyeron las publicaciones que discutían la simulación de bajo coste en inglés. Se extrajeron datos como el diseño de la investigación, la ubicación del estudio y los resultados. La plataforma Scival y VosViewer se emplearon para analizar las tendencias de publicación, las instituciones prolíficas, los autores, las revistas y la estructura conceptual e intelectual.
Resultados
El estudio encontró un aumento de la investigación con simulación de bajo coste desde 2003 hasta 2022, con un crecimiento significativo después de 2015. Predominaron los estudios observacionales (68,57%), siendo la cirugía general la especialidad más estudiada. Menos de la mitad de los estudios informaron sobre detalles de costes, y solo dos compararon el modelo de bajo coste con uno estándar. Estados Unidos lideró la producción científica, con notables redes de colaboración. Los análisis de co-ocurrencia de palabras clave y co-citación destacaron cuatro clusters principales en la investigación sobre simulación de bajo coste, con énfasis en la formación quirúrgica.
Conclusiones
Esta investigación pone de relieve el creciente interés en la simulación de bajo coste para mejorar el acceso a la formación práctica en la educación de las profesiones de la salud, especialmente bajo restricciones financieras. Sin embargo, el se requiere un mayor desarrollo, sobre todo en lo que respecta a la validación de estos modelos económicos frente a sus homólogos más caros. Dicha validación es crucial para garantizar la eficacia y comparabilidad de las simulaciones de bajo coste.

AB  - Rigs are critical capital-intensive resources for oil and gas exploration and production operations, such as drilling, completion, and workover. The Rig Scheduling Problem (RSP) comprises deciding which rigs will serve each of the wells and when the operations must be performed. Several studies considering the theoretical and practical perspectives of the RSP are available, but no complete literature review exists. Aiming to fill this gap, we developed an extensive and systematic literature review. We propose a classification for the RSP and examine 130 studies selected after implementing a structured search and analysis protocol. The majority of the papers surveyed consider homogeneous workover rigs for onshore wells, usually employing heuristics. Moreover, we observe a trend towards addressing more complex problems involving heterogeneous fleets and more realistic assumptions through advanced analytical methods. The opportunities for further research identified include considering uncertainty, integrating the RSP with other decisions, and validating technical developments in real instances.

AB  - This work proposes a solution to the distance-constrained formation control problem to attain symmetric formations. Utilizing recent results from rigidity theory for symmetric frameworks, we design a gradient-based control strategy that simultaneously drives the agents to the desired inter-agent distances and also a special position characterizing additional symmetry constraints on the graph. We show that for graphs where there exist edges between agents in the same vertex orbit induced by the automorphism group, no additional information exchange links are required. Furthermore, leveraging the symmetry constraints of the system it is possible to solve the formation control problem with fewer edges than standard approaches. In particular, the framework is not required to be minimally infinitesimally rigid in this case. Our results are demonstrated with a numerical example.

This concept analysis aims to provide a conceptual definition for school-based health centers (SBHCs). Despite growing evidence of SBHC growth and impact, there is a gap in the conceptual clarity of SBHCs.
Method
A systematic review using Walker and Avant's 8-step method of concept analysis produced 369 articles, of which 17 were analyzed. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched with no time limit to capture the history and development of SBHCs. Search terms included “school-based health” and “school-based health center.”
Results
Accessible and advanced practitioners, heterogeneity, integrated care and location, and youth-friendly provide defining attributions to SBHCs. Antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents are discussed.
Discussion
This concept analysis highlights evidence supporting the potential impact of SBHCs as a health service model for advancing health equity. Clear criteria contribute to understanding SBHCs and serve as a basis for ongoing research and stakeholder collaboration.

AB  - Purpose
This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural entrepreneurship (AE) and new technologies using academic and practitioners' perspectives to understand how new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and augmented reality can promote agri-businesses.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper adopts a content and thematic analysis of 325 academic sources extracted from the Scopus database and 683 patents retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) dataset. Additionally, the research applies the Kruskal–Wallis test as a non-parametric test for evaluating differences in the main concepts discussed in the two sources.
Findings
The academic and practitioners' debate highlights a trading zone among the two streams. patents' analysis from the EPO reveals four main common themes as a new business that benefits from AI in weather predictions, new smart and intelligent ways to monitor crops, new businesses that use clouds to control plant's humidity. The analysis of Scopus's sources demonstrates theoretical approaches related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and practical strategies in terms of entrepreneurial skills to support the agricultural sector. However, barriers among the two streams of sources exist in innovation management and scale-up entrepreneurial initiatives.
Research limitations/implications
Regarding implications, the authors aim to connect academic and practitioners' views by understanding the new potential innovation applications and the connected new research avenues. Limitations might arise from the sources used to develop our analysis.
Originality/value
The paper is novel because it investigates the issues arising from the relationship between AE and new technologies by examining original validated patents released by practitioners and approved by the EPO, rather than reviewing blogs or the financial press. This leads to a holistic understanding of the impact of tangible practices among agricultural entrepreneurs. The results support the view that new trading zones and case studies are needed to highlight and show the positive impact of technologies in this field. The authors argue that practitioners require scholars to reduce the ambiguity between AE and its expected results, leading to investments to boost new agricultural business ideas.

Objectives
To synthesise the dentoalveolar, periodontal and skeletal changes that occur when using maxillary expansion techniques assisted by temporary anchorage devices compared to conventional protocols.
Methods
Five databases and grey literature were consulted, up to December 2023, focusing on intervention designs and excluding other type of studies. The quality assessment was conducted by using the adaptation for orthodontics of the CONSORT statement, the guidelines for reporting non-randomised studies, the RoB-2 tool, and the ROBINS-I tool. A descriptive summary and meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4 were performed.
Results
Nine clinical trials were included (n=377 patients, mean age 13.2±0.6) with a diagnosis of transverse maxillary deficiency. The analysed studies showed qualitative dentoalveolar and periodontal changes after expansion, which were greater on the maxillary first premolars in tooth-borne appliances. Meta-analyses for some effects were included from two studies (n=64); patients who used tooth-borne appliances had greater effects of buccal intercoronal width between the premolars with statistically significant differences (Std Mean difference 2.34; 95% CI: 0.04–4.65 p=0.05). Conversely, those patients who used bone-borne or hybrid appliances had greater effects of buccal intercoronal width between molars with statistically significant differences (Std Mean difference −0.64; 95% CI: −1.38–0.10; p=0.09).
Conclusions
According to the studies analysed, all measurements increased in the intervention groups after expansion. Quantitative analyses show different findings at dentoalveolar level when tooth-borne, bone-borne or hybrid appliances are considered. Nevertheless, the results should be taken with caution due to the heterogeneity of the studies. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021283170), with no funding to report.

Bibliographic review from a search of the health science databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, Cuiden, Scopus, Cochrane, as well as specialized platforms, general and thematic browsers. The limits were language (English or Spanish) and publication date (2005-2015).
Results
180 articles met the inclusion criteria, and 16 of them were selected for analysis. The main results were grouped into three categories of analysis: direct patient care, family-focussed care and the nurse's role within the team.
Conclusions
the described roles place the nurse as a key element in humanising death in the ICU and so nurses can and must lead change, playing an active role in creating strategies that really promote the integration of a palliative care approach in ICU.

AB  - In recent years, autonomous electric vehicles (A-EVs) have attracted the attention of academia and industry. In urban mobility, this topology requires consensus to control behaviours under swarm robotics. Although several model-based solutions have successfully enhanced accuracy and overcome some limitations, specific technological, methodological, and security issues remain. In this study, we systematically reviewed existing research related to swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems in urban mobility. Based on the obtained results, we propose a new directed acyclic graph-based multilayer architecture model. Furthermore, we propose a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model to make predictions. To validate the model, available data based on real traffic in Madrid (Spain) were considered.

Introduction and objective
Pudendal neuralgia is a severely intense, painful, neuropathic condition, involving the dermatome of the pudendal nerve (S2, S3, S4). The diagnosis is complex and usually takes many years to be made. Techniques that use electrical current have been shown to decrease pain and improve quality of life in patients with this condition. The aim of this review was to analyze the existing literature on the effects of electrical current in the treatment of patients with pudendal neuralgia.
Material and methods
A literature search was carried out in PubMed, Cinahl, Medline, Cochrane Library, ENFISPO, PEDro, Scopus and Web of Science databases, using the search terms “Electric Stimulation Therapy”, “pudendal neuralgia” and “pudendal nerve entrapment”.
Results
The most frequently repeated intervention is pulsed radiofrequency. Other techniques used are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy and neuromodulation. All studies show significant improvement in pain, analgesic intake, depression-anxiety or quality of life.
Conclusions
The application of electrical current seems to be effective in the management of pudendal neuralgia. The scientific evidence is scarce, of poor methodological quality, and its use is based on the efficacy demonstrated in other indications of chronic pain.

AB  - Objectives
To describe and synthesise literature on clinical decision-making within diagnostic radiography, to uncover the important elements, and to identify knowledge gaps for further investigation. The scoping review question was: How do diagnostic radiographers make clinical decisions?
Key findings
Radiographers make clinical decisions before, during and after examinations. The primary source of information radiographers use is the clinical request, however, if they doubt something, they rely on their colleague's points of view rather than evidence-based practice. Many elements must be considered in the clinical decision-making process; however, lack of autonomy, sparse information on the clinical requests, and lack of time affect the process, which can lead to a barrier to effective decision-making.
Conclusion
Clinical decisions are made based on many different elements before, during, and after examinations in combination with different types of knowledge, as well as technical and organisational aspects within radiography clinical practice.
Implication for practice
There is a need to focus on giving more attention to developing the decision-making elements. In addition, there must be more focus on improving intra-professional work between radiographers and radiologists to facilitate radiographers' opportunities to act on their clinical decisions.

AB  - Intelligent Unmanned Convenience Stores (IUCVSs, hereafter) introduce a fresh, intelligent service providing customers with an innovative shopping experience making use of technologies such as computer vision, Artificial Intelligence, automated payment systems, smart entry and exit systems, and more that eliminate lines and direct interaction with retail staff. This integrated suite of digital technologies functions as a silicon shopkeeper, automating the responsibilities typically carried out by human personnel in traditional convenience store operations. Although there has been a growing emphasis on research over the past decade, the literature concerning IUCVSs still lacks coherence, being dispersed across diverse contexts. Therefore, the current moment offers a favourable opportunity to evaluate the field by establishing the foundation for forthcoming research to delineate the extent of IUCVSs. The present research provides a glimpse into the existing body of literature examining consumer receptiveness to technological interfaces in retail as opposed to human interfaces by empirically investigating the emergence and growth of IUCVSs. Searching on SCOPUS and the Web of Science has yielded a final set of 106 articles relevant to IUCVSs. Therefore, by utilising the TCCM review framework, this study offers an in-depth understanding of the prevailing theories, countries shaping the contexts, the crucial variables as typical characteristics, and the various research approaches employed in IUCVSs research from 1996 to 2024. This study contributes to the existing literature by conducting a comprehensive review of these articles, a task previously unexplored by scholars, and presents an integrated conceptual framework for IUCVSs by amalgamating the insights gleaned from such studies. This study concludes by discussing various theoretical and managerial implications and suggesting potential avenues for future research directions using the TCCM framework.

AB  - Tension leg platform (TLP) floating wind turbines (FWTs) represent a promising frontier in the research and development of the offshore wind industry. The recent completion of the first TLP floating wind farm, Provence Grand Large, marks a significant milestone. Compared to other FWT designs, TLP FWTs have advantages in motion dynamics and structural utilization, leading to improved performance and reduced cost. However, their unique physical characteristics require specialized design considerations and innovative solutions for practical implementation. To facilitate the development of next-generation TLP FWTs, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review focused on various design aspects: development, technical challenges, requirements, innovative concepts, and research methods. An overview is provided, detailing key design parameters of existing TLP FWTs, such as weight, displacement, installed capacity, and the natural period of motion. Additionally, the design challenges of TLP FWTs are summarized. Afterwards, the TLP FWT designs are classified and critically reviewed, highlighting the design features and installation methods of innovative concepts while identifying development trends in the field. Then, numerical and experimental methods for design are discussed, along with current research gaps. Finally, this paper presents four key areas for future research on TLP FWTs.

AB  - Dynamic scheduling plays a pivotal role in smart manufacturing by enabling real-time adjustments to production schedules, thereby enhancing system resilience and promoting sustainability. By efficiently responding to disruptions, dynamic scheduling maintains productivity and stability, while also reducing resource consumption and environmental impact through optimized operations and the potential integration of renewable energy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a cutting-edge artificial intelligence technique, shows promise in tackling the complexities of production scheduling, particularly in solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its potential, a comprehensive study of DRL's impact on dynamic scheduling, especially regarding system resilience and sustainability, has been lacking. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a systematic review of DRL-based dynamic scheduling focusing on resilience and sustainability. Through an analysis of two decades of literature, key application scenarios of DRL in dynamic scheduling are examined, and specific indicators are defined to assess the resilience and sustainability of these systems. The findings demonstrate DRL's effectiveness across various production domains, surpassing traditional rule-based and metaheuristic algorithms, particularly in enhancing resilience. However, a significant gap remains in addressing sustainability aspects such as energy flexibility, resource utilization, and human-centric social impacts. This paper also explores current technical challenges, including multi-objective and multi-agent optimization, and proposes future research directions to better integrate resilience and sustainability in DRL-based dynamic scheduling, with an emphasis on real-world application.

AB  - Aim
To evaluate the efficacy of natural antimicrobials derived from phenolic compounds (NAPs), compared to synthetic antimicrobials (SAs), in the biofilm control and microorganisms (MOs) count among children and adolescents at different intervention times through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
Electronic searches were carried out in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, VHL, and Grey Literature. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials were included. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the tools ROBINS-I and RoB 2.0. Meta-analyses (MAs) were performed according to three parameters: the influence of NAPs on the plaque index (PI) mean; the period of NAPs administration (≤15 days/>15 days) on the biofilm reduction; and the influence of NAPs on the MOs count subgrouping according to the type of MO (total MOs, S. mutans, and Streptococcus spp.). The standard mean differences were calculated (p ≤ 0.05) for all analyses, and the heterogeneity was tested through the I2 index. The evidence was certainty-tested using the GRADE approach.
Results
Sixteen studies were selected for qualitative synthesis, and 12 studies were included in the MAs. NAPs were less efficacious in improving the PI (p < 0.0001, I2>87 %) and reducing biofilm over time (p < 0.01, I2>87 %) but presented a reduction in MOs count similar to that of SAs (p = 0.3, I2 = 0%). The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
Conclusion
Although the use of NAPs is similar to the use of SAs in reducing MOs count, it is less effective than SAs in improving PI mean and for biofilm reduction over time.

The new product development (NPD) process has been mainly closed, and the products selected for market launch have been chosen from within the industries. Co-creation is a process in which new ideas are created and developed by industries, consumers, and other stakeholders.
Scope and approach
This review uses industry and consumer perspectives to explore the potential of co-creation in new food product development. For that, a discussion on engaging consumers in the co-creation process, the main applications in the new food product development, the methods used, and trends and challenges are provided. Key Findings and Conclusions: Co-creation has been applied mainly for meat, dairy, and bakery products or communication strategies (posts, labels, and packaging), with more studies considering developing new and healthier products and hybrid meat. Different methods have been applied in the co-creation process of food products, including focus groups (online or face-to-face), questionnaires, interactive online platforms, and face-to-face workshops. In general, co-creation results in original, valuable, feasible, and new ideas that can foster product innovation and may trigger process innovation, mainly when applied at the early stages of NPD. Factors related to the online platform, moderator, consumer motivation, participant selection, and ethical aspects should be considered for effective results. Finally, more studies should be performed using more consumers and different co-creation methods. This review is the first on the application of co-creation in new food product development, providing important insights and a discussion on the strengths, limitations, and factors to be considered.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are continuously and rapidly evolving, and these developments can have diverse consequences. ICT solutions are ubiquitous across all sectors of the economy. From a scholarly perspective, it is intriguing to observe the areas of economic activity where ICT solutions are deployed and how these solutions can contribute to the gradual transition of the economy towards sustainability. This article reports on original research aimed at individuals seeking green self-employment opportunities through the utilization of ICT. The study considers the perspective of this specific group of people and the issue of sustainable development as it discusses ICT solutions. Thus, the article identifies two interrelated, equal, and complementary objectives. The first objective is to determine the main areas where individuals seeking green self-employment use ICT solutions. The second objective is to investigate whether ICT solutions can foster the creation of green self-employment opportunities. To achieve these objectives, the study conducts a qualitative analysis of documents that describe economic activities. These documents served as the basis for applying for funding to start a business between 2019 and 2022. Specifically 603 application forms were analyzed. The study identifies key barriers to the implementation of ICT solutions in creating self-employment opportunities and highlights future implications and areas of development for ICT solutions that focus on green self-employment.

AB  - Different types of noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bond and halogen bond are analyzed for the pyrimidine containing sulfonamide derivative. Detailed structural, noncovalent, halogen interactions present in the title compound has been investigated by the single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The compound is crystallized in the triclinic crystal system with the space group P1¯.The crystal structure analysis revealed that various N-H...N, N-H...S, C-H...N, and C-H...O interactions are responsible for crystal packing. The different components are connected by a network of hydrogen bonds and halogen...halogen interactions. Also, The Hirshfeld surface analysis were done to validate the interactions quantitatively. The results obtained from ab initio calculations described herein reveal a major contribution from the electrostatic interaction on the stability of the systems considered. Beside the electrostatic interaction, the charge-transfer force and the second-order orbital interaction also play an important role in the formation of the title molecule, as suggested by the NBO analysis. The presence of halogen bonds in the molecule has been identified in terms of the QTAIM and NCI analyses, and several linear relationships have been established to provide more insight into halogen bonding interactions.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached pandemic proportions with negative impacts on global health, the world economy and human society. The clinical picture of COVID-19, and the fact that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an imbalance in the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). We review clinical strategies that are attempting to rebalance the RAS in COVID-19 patients by using ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or agonists of angiotensin-II receptor type 2 or Mas receptor (MasR). We also propose that the new MasR activator BIO101, a pharmaceutical grade formulation of 20-hydroxyecdysone that has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and cardioprotective properties, could restore RAS balance and improve the health of COVID-19 patients who have severe pneumonia.

AB  - Resumen
La microbiota ocular normal está compuesta por diferentes comunidades bacterianas Gram negativas y positivas que actúan en la superficie ocular como comensales. Un desequilibrio en la homeostasis de las especies nativas o disbiosis desencadena alteraciones funcionales que eventualmente pueden conllevar afecciones oculares, señalándose al uso de lentes de contacto como el factor predisponente más relevante. Mediante una revisión bibliográfica que incluyó artículos científicos publicados entre el año 2018 y 2022, se analizó la relación entre la microbiota ocular sana, la disbiosis asociada al uso de lentes de contacto que desencadena afecciones oculares. La microbiota ocular en individuos sanos, se compone principalmente por bacterias de los filos: proteobacterias, actinobacteria y firmicutes. Estas comunidades bacterianas al verse asociadas al uso de lentes de contacto desarrollaron disbiosis, observándose un aumento de ciertos géneros como Staphylococcus spp. y Pseudomonas spp., que en condiciones normales son comensales de la superficie ocular, pero al estar aumentada su abundancia condicionan la aparición de diversas afecciones oculares como eventos infiltrativos corneales, queratitis y úlcera corneal bacterianas. Dichas patologías tienden a evolucionar de manera rápida, lo que, sumado a una detección y tratamiento tardíos, puede determinar un pronóstico visual deficiente. Se sugiere que, frente a diversas afecciones de la superficie ocular, los profesionales en el área de oftalmología conozcan la composición de las comunidades de microorganismos que conforman esta microbiota ocular, de manera de distinguir e identificar correctamente el agente causal y, con ello, brindar un tratamiento adecuado y efectivo al usuario.
Normal ocular microbiota is composed of different Gram-negative and positive bacterial communities that act as commensals on the ocular surface. An imbalance in the homeostasis of the native species or dysbiosis triggers functional alterations that can eventually lead to ocular conditions, indicating the use of contact lenses as the most relevant predisposing factor. Through a bibliographic review that added scientific articles published between 2018 and 2022, the relationship between healthy ocular microbiota and dysbiosis associated with the use of contact lenses that trigger ocular conditions was analyzed. The ocular microbiota in healthy individuals is mainly composed of bacteria from the phyla: proteobacteria, actinobacteria and firmicutes. These bacterial communities associated with the use of contact lenses develop dysbiosis, observing an increase in certain genera such as Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., which under normal conditions are commensals of the ocular surface, but as their abundance is increased, they condition the appearance of various ocular conditions such as corneal infiltrative events, bacterial keratitis and corneal ulcer. These pathologies tend to evolve rapidly, which, added to late detection and treatment, can lead to a poor visual prognosis. It is suggested that professionals in the ophthalmology area learn about the composition of the communities of microorganisms that make up this ocular microbiota, in order to correctly distinguish and identify the causative agent, thereby providing a adequate and effective treatment to the user.

AB  - Aim
To assess the efficacy of infiltrated amides in reducing pain caused by arterial puncture for blood gas analysis.
Method
A search protocol was developed and applied across four databases (Medline, SCOPUS, Embase, and TRIP Database). Clinical trials published between January 2000 and May 2024, in either Spanish or English, were considered. Clinical trials comparing the analgesic efficacy of infiltrated amides in adult patients undergoing arterial puncture were selected.
Results
Five randomised clinical trials were selected, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 133 adult patients per randomization group. The studies showed mixed results regarding the efficacy of infiltrated amides in reducing pain associated with arterial puncture. Two studies highlighted mepivacaine for its pain reduction efficacy, while the other three demonstrated variable efficacy of lidocaine.
Conclusions
The efficacy of infiltrated amides as local anaesthetics in arterial puncture for blood gas analysis varies. Mepivacaine appears promising; however, further studies are needed to establish clear recommendations. It is crucial to consider patient preferences and professional experience when deciding on the use of these anaesthetics.

AB  - Resumen
La endometriosis es una patología ginecológica crónica e inflamatoria caracterizada por la presencia de tejido endometrial fuera del útero. Entre las manifestaciones clínicas están el dolor pélvico crónico, la fatiga, la dismenorrea, la dispareunia, la infertilidad, la disuria y la disquecia. La fisioterapia puede formar parte del tratamiento sintomático de la endometriosis, es por ello, que con esta revisión se pretende analizar la bibliografía científica para evaluar el efecto de la fisioterapia en este padecimiento. Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica durante las dos primeras semanas del mes de diciembre de 2022 en las bases de datos PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) y Enfermería-Fisioterapia-Podología (ENFISPO). Se emplearon los descriptores «Endometriosis» «Physical Therapy Modalities», «Physiotherapy», «Physiotherapist», «Physical therapy» y «Physical rehabilitation». Los resultados se limitaron a estudios clínicos aleatorizados publicados en inglés o español. Se obtuvieron un total de 943 artículos, de los cuales seis fueron seleccionados tras aplicar los criterios de elegibilidad. Las investigaciones seleccionadas desarrollaron diferentes intervenciones de fisioterapia con técnicas tales como la electroterapia con estimulación nerviosa transcutánea (TENS) y láser pulsado de alta intensidad (HILT), el entrenamiento de relajación muscular progresiva, la actividad física aeróbica, la terapia manual y el ejercicio terapéutico a través del yoga. La fisioterapia parece aportar beneficios en cuanto a la reducción del dolor pélvico y mejora de la calidad de vida en mujeres con endometriosis.
Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory gynecological pathology characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus. Clinical manifestations include chronic pelvic pain, fatigue, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility, dysuria and dyschezia. Physical therapy can be part of the symptomatic treatment of endometriosis; therefore, this review aims to analyze the scientific literature to evaluate the effect of physical therapy in endometriosis. A bibliographic search was carried out during the first two weeks of December 2022 in the databases PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL and ENFISPO. The descriptors “Endometriosis” “Physical Therapy Modalities”, “Physiotherapy”, “Physiotherapist”, “Physical therapy” and “Physical rehabilitation” were used. Results were limited to randomized clinical studies published in English or Spanish. A total of 943 results were obtained, of which 6 were selected after applying the eligibility criteria. The selected studies develop different physiotherapy interventions with techniques such as electrotherapy with TENS and high intensity pulsed laser, progressive muscle relaxation training, aerobic training, manual therapy, and therapeutic exercise through yoga. Physiotherapy appears to provide benefits in terms of reducing pelvic pain and improving quality of life in women with endometriosis.

AB  - Background:
Understanding dependencies within microservices is essential for maintaining and evolving scalable and efficient software architectures. Dependencies influence how changes in one microservice might propagate to other microservices. With the decentralized nature of microservices, these dependencies might not be explicit to developers and lead to unique challenges in modern software development environments.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to synthesize existing literature on microservice dependencies, identify the types of dependencies, and examine the strategies employed to manage and analyze these relationships. This effort aims to elucidate how dependencies affect microservice systems and to provide a comprehensive overview of dependency management within microservices.
Method:
We conducted a multivocal literature review, starting with an initial dataset of 1,733 papers from academic literature (white literature). This corpus was narrowed down through a rigorous filtering process to 45 key publications that address the identification, management, and impacts of dependencies in microservices. Additionally, we incorporated 926 articles from grey literature sources such as Google, Stack Overflow, and Stack Exchange, expanding the scope beyond traditional academic research. After the filtration process, 45 articles were fully synthesized to integrate practical insights and professional experiences into our review.
Results:
The review identifies several types of dependencies in microservice systems and synthesizes this information into a unified dependency taxonomy. This review highlights a range of approaches to dependency management, revealing a significant gap in systematic catering approaches to generate taxonomies for dependencies and the need for integrated management tools. The findings underscore the fragmented nature of existing dependency management practices and the potential for more holistic approaches.
Conclusion:
This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, outlining effective strategies and pointing out areas needing improvement in dependency management. By offering a structured overview of the topic, the study serves as a roadmap for future research and development efforts to enhance the robustness and maintainability of microservices.

AB  - Resumen
Con el objetivo de revisar los resultados recientes obtenidos tras la aplicación de maniobras de reposicionamiento en el tratamiento del vértigo posicional paroxístico benigno (VPPB), se realizó una búsqueda de enero de 2010 a mayo de 2016 en Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL y PubMed. Los criterios de inclusión fueron: estudios con pacientes afectados por VPPB, a los que se les realizase una maniobra de reposicionamiento, y con resultados pre- y postintervención. Se obtuvieron 17 estudios. Estos resaltan que el canal semicircular posterior es el más afectado habitualmente, que el VPPB afecta más a mujeres y durante la sexta y séptima décadas de la vida, que el principal test de valoración empleado es el de Dix-Hallpike y que la maniobra de Epley es la más usada y parece que más efectiva. Sin embargo, se precisa protocolizar las pautas diagnósticas y de tratamiento del VPPB, teniendo en cuenta que hay resoluciones espontáneas, afectación de otros canales semicirculares distintos al posterior o pueden existir contraindicaciones a determinados movimientos en algunos pacientes. Además, son necesarios estudios de mayor calidad metodológica.
This study aimed to review current evidence on the results obtained after implementation of repositioning manoeuvres in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). To do this, a search was made of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and PubMed databases for articles published from January 2010 to May 2016. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies in patients with BPPV treated with a repositioning manoeuvre, and with pre- and postintervention results. Seventeen studies were obtained. The main results indicate that the posterior semicircular canal is usually the most affected site and that BPPV is more common in men than in women and during the sixth and seventh decades of life; the main test used is the Dix-Hallpike test and the most widely used manoeuver is the Epley manoeuvre, which seems to be the most effective. However, guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV should be protocol-based, considering that the condition sometimes resolves spontaneously, there may be involvement of other semicircular canals, and certain movements may be contraindicated in some patients. There is a need for studies with higher methodological quality.

AB  - As a transversal concept tied to human evolution, security has increased its relevance at the same pace as development and digitisation. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the sophistication of advanced persistent threats, the emerging paradigm of cognitive security (i.e., defined by some authors as the use of self-aware and adaptable AI with learning capabilities to detect and mitigate security threats) gains momentum. Nevertheless, cognitive security is a complex concept that requires a more granular description. In this article, we redefine cognitive security by first analysing the state of the art to derive the current state of practice and the definitions of cognitive security. Next, we expand the concept of cognitive security by analysing its multiple pillars, including learning theories, AI technologies, human–computer interactions, and the ethical and legal aspects impacting its development and implementation. The latter is crucial towards understanding cognitive security, providing insight into its potential and prerequisites towards its realisation while emphasising its multidisciplinary nature. In addition to such a description, we analyse the current challenges in three closely interconnected fields, namely cybersecurity, digital forensics, and digital investigations, to provide a taxonomy that can be used to assess the current challenges and limitations of cognitive security and understand its potential better. Finally, we propose future research directions, aiming to develop cognitive systems capable of continuous learning, adaptation, and ethical compliance in dynamic cybersecurity environments. Our findings highlight the role of cognitive computing systems in enhancing cybersecurity, discussing the integration of human cognition and AI for proactive and resilient security solutions.

AB  - Background
Informal caregivers (IC) play an important role in the community as health care providers for people who are dependent on self-care. Health literacy contributes to empowerment, better care, and self-management of one’s own health and can be developed using digital technologies.
Objective
This study aims to map scientific evidence about the use of digital technologies to promote health literacy and the empowerment of ICs.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed databases were searched to find primary studies on the theme. Inclusion criteria were based on the Population, Concept, and Context logic. To be selected for analysis, studies must have involved informal or family caregivers aged ≥18 years who provide care to dependent persons and who have access to the internet and digital devices (computer, smartphone, and tablet). A total of 2 independent researchers (SS and LVH) performed the screening process. This study is part of a main project that was approved by the Ethics Committee for Health of the Regional Health Administration of Lisbon and Tagus Valley (reference 058/CES/INV/2022).
Results
A total of 9 studies were included in the review. The analysis of the studies showed that ICs use digital tools, such as computers and smartphones, with smartphones being the preferred tool. ICs use the internet to access information; manage home tasks; communicate with relatives, their peers, and health care professionals; and take part in forums. Due to difficulties in leaving their houses, forums are highly valued to preserve human connections.
Conclusions
The use of digital technologies to convey clear, objective, reliable, and accessible information is a strategic action for promoting health literacy and for contemplating the variable care needs of ICs. By working with ICs in the development of new technologies, researchers are building a new tool that meets ICs’ needs.

AB  - Importance
Findings from several high profile meta-analyses have raised concerns about an ongoing global decline in sperm concentration and male fertility. However, these studies exhibit considerable heterogeneity in key variables including study population, methodology, fertility status, and geographic region.
Objective
To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring temporal trends in sperm concentration among fertile men and men unselected for fertility status in the United States.
Data Sources
A literature search performed in Scopus and PubMed databases for studies published between 1970 and 2023. Additional studies were included from citations of prior global meta-analyses and reviews evaluating temporal trends in sperm count.
Study Selection and Synthesis
Studies were included if they presented original data on sperm concentration in US men without known infertility from 1970 to 2023. Aggregate data were assessed across all study populations, with additional subgroup analyses stratified by fertility status and US region.
Main Outcomes
Weighted generalized linear models were generated to evaluate the association between mean sperm concentration and sample collection year.
Results
A total of 874 articles were screened, with 58 meeting the inclusion criteria. These represented 75 unique study populations totaling 11,787 men in the United States. Across all study populations, no change in sperm concentration was observed between 1970 and 2018 in unadjusted models (β = 0.14 million/mL per year). When adjusting for US region, no statistically significant decline in sperm concentration was seen. When adjusting for both region and fertility status, a modest annual decline was observed to meet statistical significance (β = –0.35 million/mL per year). Of the 49 study populations reporting adequate data to determine mean total sperm count, there was a significant increase in total sperm count of 2.9 million per year between 1970 and 2018. Subgroup analysis found no statistically significant change in mean sperm concentration among any US census region or fertility status cohort.
Conclusion and Relevance
In contrast to prior global studies, this analysis suggests no clinically significant decline in sperm concentration among confirmed fertile men and the general male US population without known infertility. Although these findings provide some reassurance against a widespread rapid decline, further studies are necessary to better understand this important topic.
La concentración de esperma se mantiene estable en los hombres estadounidenses fértiles: una revisión sistemática y meta-análisis
Importancia
Hallazgos de varios meta-análisis de elevada calidad han aumentado la preocupación sobre un posible descenso global en la concentración del esperma y la fertilidad masculina. Sin embargo, estos estudios muestran una considerable heterogeneidad en variables clave, como la población estudiada, la metodología, el estado de fertilidad y la región geográfica.
Objetivo
Realizar una revisión sistemática y un meta-análisis para explorar las tendencias temporales en la concentración de esperma entre hombres fértiles y hombres no seleccionados según su estado de fertilidad en los Estados Unidos.
Fuentes de datos
Se realizó una búsqueda en las bases de datos Scopus y PubMed para estudios publicados entre 1970 y 2023. Se incluyeron estudios adicionales citados en meta-análisis globales y revisiones previas que evaluaron tendencias temporales en el conteo de espermatozoides.
Selección y síntesis de estudios
Se incluyeron estudios que presentaban datos originales sobre la concentración de espermatozoides en hombres estadounidenses sin infertilidad conocida desde 1970 hasta 2023. Se evaluaron datos agregados de todas las poblaciones estudiadas, con análisis de subgrupos estratificados por estado de fertilidad y región de los EE. UU.
Resultados principales
Se generaron modelos lineales generalizados ponderados para evaluar la asociación entre la concentración promedio de espermatozoides y el año de recolección de la muestra.
Resultados
De 874 artículos analizados, 58 cumplieron los criterios de inclusión, representando 75 poblaciones de estudio únicas con un total de 11787 hombres en los EE. UU. En las poblaciones estudiadas, no se observó ningún cambio en la concentración de espermatozoides entre 1970 y 2018 en los modelos no ajustados (b = 0.14 millones/mL por año). Al ajustar por región de EE. UU., no se encontró un descenso estadísticamente significativo. Al ajustar por región y estado de fertilidad, se observó un ligero descenso anual estadísticamente significativo (b = -0.35 millones/mL por año). En las 49 poblaciones de estudio con datos adecuados para calcular el conteo total de espermatozoides, se observó un aumento significativo de 2.9 millones al año entre 1970 y 2018. El análisis de subgrupos no encontró cambios estadísticamente significativos en la concentración promedio de espermatozoides por región del censo de EE. UU. ni por estado de fertilidad.
Conclusión y relevancia
A diferencia de estudios globales previos, este análisis sugiere que no hay una disminución clínicamente significativa en la concentración de espermatozoides entre hombres fértiles confirmados y la población masculina general sin infertilidad conocida en los Estados Unidos. Aunque estos hallazgos aportan cierta tranquilidad sobre un descenso rápido generalizado, se necesitan más estudios para comprender mejor este tema tan importante.

Introducción
La emergencia sanitaria por COVID-19 generó una gran presión laboral en las instituciones de salud, ocasionando la aparición de trastornos mentales como estrés, ansiedad, depresión, insomnio y estrés postraumático en los trabajadores de la salud (TS). El objetivo de esta investigación fue determinar la prevalencia de los trastornos mentales y los factores asociados en esta población durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
Métodos
Se realizó una revisión de revisiones publicadas del 1 de enero de 2020 al 30 de abril de 2023 en las bases de datos PubMed, Scopus y Scielo. La calidad metodológica de los artículos se evalúo mediante la escala de evaluación crítica de revisiones sistemáticas de estudios de intervenciones de salud (AMSTAR-2).
Resultados
Se extrajo información de 42 revisiones sistemáticas con o sin metaanálisis. Los trastornos de salud mental más frecuentes en los TS fueron el trastorno de ansiedad, depresivo, estrés, insomnio y trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT). Se identificaron como factores de riesgo: ser mujer, ser profesional de enfermería, ser personal de la salud de primera línea, trabajar en una unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI), no tener acceso a equipos de protección personal y contar con un conocimiento insuficiente sobre la enfermedad. La herramienta más utilizada para mejorar el afrontamiento de los profesionales de la salud fue la capacitación al personal.
Conclusiones
El personal de la salud que enfrentó la pandemia por COVID-19 presentó una alta prevalencia de trastornos mentales. Se requiere la formulación de políticas e implementación de estrategias que permitan prevenir los trastornos mentales y promover la salud mental en los profesionales.
Introduction

AB  - Video understanding technology has become increasingly important in various disciplines, yet current approaches have primarily focused on lower comprehension level of video content, posing challenges for providing comprehensive and professional insights at a higher comprehension level. Video analysis plays a crucial role in athlete training and strategy development in racket sports. This study aims to demonstrate an innovative and higher-level video comprehension framework (ChatMatch), which integrates computer vision technologies with the cutting-edge large language models (LLM) to enable intelligent analysis and inference of racket sports videos. To examine the feasibility of this framework, we deployed a prototype of ChatMatch in the badminton in this study. A vision-based encoder was first proposed to extract the meta-features included the locations, actions, gestures, and action results of players in each frame of racket match videos, followed by a rule-based decoding method to transform the extracted information in both structured knowledge and unstructured knowledge. A set of LLM-based agents included namely task identifier, coach agent, statistician agent, and video manager, was developed through a prompt engineering and driven by an automated mechanism. The automatic collaborative interaction among the agents enabled the provision of a comprehensive response to professional inquiries from users. The validation findings showed that our vision models had excellent performances in meta-feature extraction, achieving a location identification accuracy of 0.991, an action recognition accuracy of 0.902, and a gesture recognition accuracy of 0.950. Additionally, a total of 100 questions were gathered from four proficient badminton players and one coach to evaluate the performance of the LLM-based agents, and the outcomes obtained from ChatMatch exhibited commendable results across general inquiries, statistical queries, and video retrieval tasks. These findings highlight the potential of using this approach that can offer valuable insights for athletes and coaches while significantly improve the efficiency of sports video analysis.

AB  - In recent years, decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have gained increasing attention for solving complex optimization problems. However, existing weight vector adaptation methods often struggle to balance diversity and convergence. To address this issue, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on transfer learning (MOEA/D-TL), which integrates joint distribution adaptation (JDA) to coordinate the populations generated by genetic and differential operators. The key innovations of MOEA/D-TL include: (1) a dual-operator framework that leverages JDA to integrate the strengths of both operators; (2) auxiliary population labeling using Pareto dominance, leveraging JDA’s characteristics; and (3) sparsity-driven adaptive weight vector adjustment to refine population distribution. Extensive experiments on 44 benchmark problems demonstrate that MOEA/D-TL outperforms nine state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a 42%–60% improvement across three performance metrics. When applied to the optimization of sliding bearings with conflicting objectives (load capacity, heat generation, and friction coefficient), MOEA/D-TL yields solutions with broader distribution and improved uniformity compared to seven other algorithms. These results validate the algorithm’s capability to balance diversity and convergence effectively.

AB  - Over the last two decades, mindfulness has become increasingly mainstream in the workplace and has attracted significant scholarly attention. However, there lacks a comprehensive and updated review of mindfulness that identifies historical research trends and establishes the current state of knowledge. To address this gap, we conduct a structured review of 217 articles published in top management and psychology journals between 2003 and 2022. Our findings reveal an uneven development in mindfulness research by topic. For example, while substantial research has examined the associations between mindfulness and both job performance and health outcomes, few studies have considered which factors moderate these associations. We propose five areas for future research that will facilitate a deeper understanding of mindfulness at work: the associations between mindfulness and adaptive performance, the design of mindfulness interventions, the complex nature of mindfulness effects, team mindfulness, and the interactions between different levels of mindfulness.

AB  - Finding the equilibrium strategy of agents is one of the central problems in game theory. Perhaps equally intriguing is the inverse of the above problem: from the available finite set of actions at equilibrium, how can we learn the utilities of players competing against each other and eventually use the learned models to predict their future actions? Instead of following an estimate-then-predict approach, this work proposes a decision-focused learning (DFL) method that directly learns the utility function to improve prediction accuracy. The game's equilibrium is represented as a layer and integrated into an end-to-end optimization framework. We discuss the statistical bounds of covering numbers for the set of solution functions corresponding to the solution of a generic parametric variational inequality. Also, we establish the generalization bound for the set of solution functions with respect to the smooth loss function with an improved rate. Moreover, we proposed an algorithm based on the iterative differentiation strategy to forward and backpropagate through the equilibrium layer. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is established. Finally, We numerically validate the proposed framework in the utility learning problem among the agents whose utility functions are approximated by partially input convex neural networks (PICNN).

Objetivo
Evaluar la eficacia de las amidas infiltradas para reducir el dolor causado por la punción arterial para gasometría.
Método
Se elaboró un protocolo de búsqueda que se empleó en cuatro bases de datos (Medline, SCOPUS, Embase y TRIP Database). Se consideraron ensayos clínicos publicados entre enero de 2000 y mayo de 2024, en español o en inglés. Se seleccionaron ensayos clínicos que compararan la eficacia analgésica de las amidas infiltradas en pacientes adultos sometidos a punción arterial.
Resultados
Fueron seleccionados 5 ensayos clínicos aleatorizados, con tamaños muestrales comprendidos entre 10 y 133 pacientes adultos por grupo de aleatorización. Los estudios mostraron resultados mixtos en la eficacia de las amidas infiltradas para reducir el dolor asociado con la punción arterial. Dos estudios destacaron la mepivacaína por su eficacia en la reducción del dolor, mientras que otros tres mostraron una eficacia variable de la lidocaína.
Conclusiones
La eficacia de las amidas infiltradas como anestésicos locales en la punción arterial para gasometría es variable. La mepivacaína se muestra prometedora; sin embargo, se necesitan más estudios para establecer recomendaciones claras. Es fundamental considerar las preferencias del paciente y la experiencia del profesional al decidir el uso de estos anestésicos.
Aim
To assess the efficacy of infiltrated amides in reducing pain caused by arterial puncture for blood gas analysis.
Method
A search protocol was developed and applied across four databases (Medline, SCOPUS, Embase, and TRIP Database). Clinical trials published between January 2000 and May 2024, in either Spanish or English, were considered. Clinical trials comparing the analgesic efficacy of infiltrated amides in adult patients undergoing arterial puncture were selected.
Results
Five randomized clinical trials were selected, with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 133 adult patients per randomization group. The studies showed mixed results regarding the efficacy of infiltrated amides in reducing pain associated with arterial puncture. Two studies highlighted mepivacaine for its pain reduction efficacy, while the other three demonstrated variable efficacy of lidocaine.
Conclusions
The efficacy of infiltrated amides as local anesthetics in arterial puncture for blood gas analysis varies. Mepivacaine appears promising; however, further studies are needed to establish clear recommendations. It is crucial to consider patient preferences and professional experience when deciding on the use of these anesthetics.

AB  - The rapid digital transformation of transportation systems has elevated Extended Reality (XR) technologies—including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)—as critical tools. XR improves safety, optimizes mobility, and enhances human-machine interaction.This study presents a bibliometric analysis and thematic review of XR research in transportation. We analyzed 283 Scopus-indexed publications from 2014 to 2024 using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and Python-based libraries. The results show an annual publication growth rate of 18.15%. Cornell University, the University of Glasgow, and Delft University of Technology emerged as leading institutional contributors. National leadership was dominated by the United States, Germany, and China.Thematic mapping identified key areas such as autonomous vehicle validation, pedestrian-AV interaction, AI-driven traffic simulation, immersive driver training, and AR navigation for rail and maritime transport. Keyword analysis emphasized research focuses including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Vehicles, Pedestrian Safety, Mixed Reality, Traffic Simulation, and Human Factors.Despite this progress, significant challenges persist. Studies often lack ecological validity, demographic diversity, scalability, cybersecurity resilience, and ethical transparency. Most XR applications remain confined to laboratory settings with limited real-world validation or cross-cultural generalizability.To address these gaps, we propose integrated frameworks and a strategic research agenda. We emphasize ecological realism, cognitive-adaptive XR designs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical governance.This study consolidates existing knowledge and outlines future research directions. XR is positioned as a transformative and human-centered technology, crucial for advancing safer, smarter, and more inclusive transportation ecosystems.

AB  - Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize health care by enhancing both clinical outcomes and operational efficiency. However, its clinical adoption has been slower than anticipated, largely due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Existing frameworks remain insufficient and tend to emphasize technical metrics such as accuracy and validation, while overlooking critical real-world factors such as clinical impact, integration, and economic sustainability. This narrow focus prevents AI tools from being effectively implemented, limiting their broader impact and long-term viability in clinical practice.
Objective
This study aimed to create a framework for assessing AI in health care, extending beyond technical metrics to incorporate social and organizational dimensions. The framework was developed by systematically reviewing, analyzing, and synthesizing the evaluation criteria necessary for successful implementation, focusing on the long-term real-world impact of AI in clinical practice.
Methods
A search was performed in July 2024 across the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify relevant studies published in English between January 2019 and mid-July 2024, yielding 3528 results, among which 44 studies met the inclusion criteria. The systematic review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Data were analyzed using NVivo through thematic analysis and narrative synthesis to identify key emergent themes in the studies.
Results
By synthesizing the included studies, we developed a framework that goes beyond the traditional focus on technical metrics or study-level methodologies. It integrates clinical context and real-world implementation factors, offering a more comprehensive approach to evaluating AI tools. With our focus on assessing the long-term real-world impact of AI technologies in health care, we named the framework AI for IMPACTS. The criteria are organized into seven key clusters, each corresponding to a letter in the acronym: (1) I—integration, interoperability, and workflow; (2) M—monitoring, governance, and accountability; (3) P—performance and quality metrics; (4) A—acceptability, trust, and training; (5) C—cost and economic evaluation; (6) T—technological safety and transparency; and (7) S—scalability and impact. These are further broken down into 28 specific subcriteria.
Conclusions
The AI for IMPACTS framework offers a holistic approach to evaluate the long-term real-world impact of AI tools in the heterogeneous and challenging health care context and lays the groundwork for further validation through expert consensus and testing of the framework in real-world health care settings. It is important to emphasize that multidisciplinary expertise is essential for assessment, yet many assessors lack the necessary training. In addition, traditional evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with AI’s rapid development. To ensure successful AI integration, flexible, fast-tracked assessment processes and proper assessor training are needed to maintain rigorous standards while adapting to AI’s dynamic evolution.

AB  - With the continuous growth of the urban population, the world is confronting numerous challenges in the near future of cities, related to environmental, economic and social aspects (e.g., traffic congestion, air pollution, waste management, etc.). The smart cyber city concept is introduced as a solution to achieve sustainability, effective management of energy, and smart living. Designing such complex systems with such features is an equally complex challenge. The cyber physical system (CPS) and the Internet of thing (IoT) are keys to achieve the realization of current smart city. In this paper, a survey of smart city vision is given while highlighting the potential benefits of a smart cyber city. A bibliometric network with Vosviewer software was created in order to select the most significant papers. It reviews smart city's key requirements and smart city enabling technologies. It then highlights the potential role of CPS and IoT. Finally, an outline of future research areas is given.

AB  - Introduction: In COPD patients, mucus plugs are associated with lower lung function, worse quality of life, higher all-cause mortality, and a higher rate of exacerbations. The aim of the study was to determine whether subjects with COPD with a higher cumulative smoking history, such as current smokers, have a higher mucus plug score compared to former and never smokers with COPD. Material and Methods: We have carried out a systematic review of the literature (SRL) and a meta-analysis (MA). Results: Nine articles were finally included in the SRL, and 6 of them were part of the MA. We found that subjects who had never smoked had a lower rate of mucus plugs when compared to active and ex-smokers (OR 0.08 [CI 95% 0.06, 0.12]). When comparing subjects with and without mucus plugs between current smokers vs. ex-smokers, we found that ex-smokers had a higher rate of mucus plugs than current smokers (OR 1.12 [CI 95% 1.02,1.24]). When comparing subjects without mucus plugs or with a low mucus plug score (0-2) with a high mucus plug score (>3) between current smokers vs. ex-smokers, we found that ex-smokers had a higher mucus plug score than current smokers (OR 1.19 [CI 95% 1.08, 1.32]) Conclusions: We found that subjects who have never smoked have a lower rate of mucus plugs than those who have smoked and that ex-smokers with COPD have a higher rate of mucus plugs than current smokers with COPD. Quitting smoking is the most significant modifiable risk factor for COPD.
Resumen
Introducción: En pacientes con EPOC, los tapones mucosos se asocian con una función pulmonar más baja, peor calidad de vida, mayor mortalidad por cualquier causa y una mayor tasa de exacerbaciones. El objetivo del estudio fue determinar si los sujetos con EPOC con un mayor historial de tabaquismo acumulado, como los fumadores actuales, presentan una mayor puntuación de tapón mucoso en comparación con los exfumadores y los nunca fumadores con EPOC. Material y Métodos: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de la literatura (SRL) y un metaanálisis (MA). Resultados: Nueve artículos se incluyeron finalmente en la SRL, y 6 de ellos formaron parte del MA. Se observó que los sujetos que nunca habían fumado presentaron una menor tasa de tapones mucosos en comparación con los fumadores activos y exfumadores (OR: 0,08 [IC 95%: 0,06; 0,12]). Al comparar sujetos con y sin tapones mucosos entre fumadores actuales y exfumadores, se observó que los exfumadores presentaron una mayor tasa de tapones mucosos que los fumadores actuales (OR: 1,12 [IC del 95%: 1,02; 1,24]). Al comparar sujetos sin tapones mucosos o con una puntuación baja de tapón mucoso (0-2) con una puntuación alta de tapón mucoso (>3) entre fumadores actuales y exfumadores, se observó que los exfumadores presentaron una puntuación de tapón mucoso mayor que los fumadores actuales (OR: 1,19 [IC del 95%: 1,08; 1,32]). Conclusiones: Se observó que los sujetos que nunca han fumado presentan una menor tasa de tapones mucosos que los que han fumado, y que los exfumadores con EPOC presentan una mayor tasa de tapones mucosos que los fumadores actuales con EPOC. Dejar de fumar es el factor de riesgo modificable más significativo para la EPOC.

AB  - Purpose
Entrepreneurship education plays a crucial role in the development of entrepreneurs and the enhancement of entrepreneurial activities in every economy. This paper presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of this paper is to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions.
Design/methodology/approach
Systematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence-based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected databases, using predetermined key words by the researchers.
Findings
The main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80 percent of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database.
Research limitations/implications
The paper is limited since it is based on a review of literature from a selected range of databases, covering a specific time span. This potentially excludes other studies outside this time span. Scholarship in this area and context will benefit greatly when researchers target, choose and engage the higher ranked and more impactful journals as the outlet for their research outputs.
Practical implications
At a time when efforts are being made to address socioeconomic issues like poverty and unemployment through mainstream training in entrepreneurship education, this paper provides a better understanding of the state of research in this context, by highlighting the potential gaps as to where research investigation is needed for better policy formulation and guiding future research.
Originality/value
There are limited studies that focus on the issue of entrepreneurial mindset in entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Overall, this paper identifies an important gap in the literature that warrants future research.

AB  - Purpose
The objective of this study is to advance the understanding of the connection between cultural distance and the cross-border diffusion of innovations by conducting a systematic review and analysis of previous literature.
Design/methodology/approach
This study involved a literature review. A total of 35 articles published in ABS journals were identified from key management, international business and marketing journals. The articles were analyzed by the methodologies and findings presented.
Findings
The literature review shows that the adoption and diffusion of innovation and new products are bound to be deeply influenced by cultural distance. Specifically, national cultures influence the willingness of consumers to buy new products at both the individual and organizational levels; organizational culture plays a key role in the process of launching new products and diffusing innovations to the market. However, existing studies and their findings are fragmented and inconsistent. Controversial views remain regarding the impact of national cultural dimensions on the diffusion of innovation at the individual and organizational levels.
Originality/value
This is the first systematic review of the literature specifically focusing on the impact of cultural distance on the cross-border diffusion of innovation. In identifying the research gaps and limitations of extant studies, the authors point to avenues for future research to develop a more integrated research agenda for marketing, management and international business research.
Propósito
El objetivo de este estudio es avanzar en la compresión de la conexión que existe entre la distancia cultual y la difusión transfronteriza de innovaciones, mediante la realización de una revisión sistemática y un análisis de la literatura previa.
Diseño/metodología/enfoque
Este estudio incluyó una revisión de la literatura. Y se identificaron un total de 35 artículos en las revistas, relacionados con clave de gestión, negocios internacionales y marketing, publicados en revistas de ABS. Los artículos fueron analizados por las metodologías y hallazgos presentados.
Resultados
La revisión de la literatura muestra que la adopción y la difusión de la innovación y los nuevos productos, están fuertemente influenciados por la distancia cultural. Específicamente, las culturas nacionales influyen en la disposición de los consumidores a comprar nuevos productos, tanto a nivel individual como a nivel organizacional; la cultura organizacional desempeña un papel clave en el proceso de lanzamiento de nuevos productos y difusión de innovaciones en el mercado. Sin embargo, los estudios existentes y sus hallazgos son fragmentados e inconsistentes. Sigue dándose opiniones controvertidas sobre el impacto de las dimensiones culturales nacionales en la difusión de la innovación a nivel individual y organizacional.
Originalidad/valor
Esta es la primera revisión sistemática de la literatura, que se centra específicamente en el impacto de la distancia cultural en la difusión transfronteriza de la innovación. Al identificar las brechas de la investigación y las limitaciones de los estudios existentes, señalamos vías para futuras investigaciones, con el fin de desarrollar una agenda de investigación más integrada para el estudio de marketing, administración y negocios internacionales.

Diseño
Revisión sistemática.
Fuentes de datos
Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL y PsycINFO.
Selección de estudios
Se realizó la búsqueda el 17 de junio de 2024. Se incluyeron los artículos originales y reporte de casos, cuya temática fuera afín al propósito principal de este trabajo, y publicados en los últimos 10 años.
Extracción de datos
Dos revisores realizaron la extracción de datos. Se valoró la calidad metodológica con las herramientas de evaluación crítica para estudios no aleatorizados del Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).
Resultados
Fueron incorporados un total de 19 estudios. El retraso en el diagnóstico, la ausencia de formación en la atención hacia esta patología, así como la subjetividad de su sintomatología, hacen que la fibromialgia sea un gran desafío para los profesionales de la salud. Se describe un prototipo estereotipado de paciente, que convierte la fibromialgia en una enfermedad de prestigio inferior, sin base orgánica que la legitime.
Conclusiones
Los profesionales de la salud señalan la falta de formación adecuada para diagnosticar y tratar la fibromialgia. Las personas que padecen esta enfermedad suelen ser consideradas pacientes difíciles, cuya credibilidad se cuestiona constantemente y están marcadas por el estigma. Este trabajo identifica los factores que generan discordancia tanto en profesionales como en los propios afectados para optimizar la práctica clínica.
Objective
To describe the prejudices, attitudes and stereotypes that health professionals, mainly in general medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, rheumatology, mental health, nursing and physiotherapy, have towards fibromyalgia.
Design
Systematic review.
Data sources
Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL and PsycINFO.
Study selection
The search was carried out on 17 June 2024. Original articles and case reports, whose subject matter was related to the main purpose of this work, and published in the last ten years, were included.
Data extraction
Data extraction was performed by two reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI).
Results
A total of 19 studies were included. The delay in diagnosis, the lack of training in the management of this condition, and the subjectivity of its symptoms make fibromyalgia a significant challenge for healthcare professionals. A stereotypical patient profile is described, which contributes to fibromyalgia being perceived as a low-prestige disease, lacking an organic basis that legitimizes it.
Conclusions
Health professionals highlight the lack of adequate training to diagnose and treat fibromyalgia. People suffering from this disease are often seen as difficult patients, whose credibility is constantly questioned and stigmatised. This study identifies the factors that cause discordance between professionals and patients, in order to optimise clinical practice.

This research offers insights to promote the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Based on the proposed hypothesis, IoT-TE research is highly relevant to SDG 7 and SDG 11. Therefore, this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of publications that support SDGs in IoT-TE. 873 articles from the Scopus database up to December 2023 were analyzed with its significant trends. A substantial portion of the citations focused on research published within the past ten years, reaching a notable peak in 2018 with an estimated 15,000 citations. IoT-TE research predominantly supported target was 7.3 Target (double the improvement in energy efficiency). This is the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of IoT-TE literature supporting SDGs. The identified research gaps will influence IoT-TE research future directions and encourage cooperative research efforts. Furthermore, the research themes showed that energy efficiency is the forefront keyword of the current bibliometric research about IoT-TE. This study will help decision-makers and practitioners interested in SDGs understand the latest advances in research and achieve sustainability.

AB  - ﻿Abstract
In the pursuit of discovering and developing compounds with antioxidant and other biological activities, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated 10 hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives of 4-hydroxybenzohydrazide (ohbh1-10) as potential antioxidants. The compounds were synthesized using a Milestone FlexiWave microwave reactor, which significantly reduced reaction times and improved product yields. The radical-scavenging activities of the synthesized derivatives were assessed through DPPH and ABTS assays, revealing moderate antioxidant activity compared to the standard antioxidant, Trolox. To explore their potential biological applications, molecular docking simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinities of the hydrazide-hydrazones within the active sites of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The in silico studies indicated that ohbh10 could act as a dual inhibitor of MAO-B and AChE. Additionally, ADME predictions for ohbh10 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and gastrointestinal absorption. Future work will focus on introducing additional hydroxyl groups into the molecular framework to enhance radical-scavenging properties. Furthermore, the molecular docking results will be validated through in vitro experiments to confirm the dual inhibitory potential of ohbh10 against MAO-B and AChE.

AB  - Background
Stroke is a very common pathology, with a high prevalence of impairment of the sensorimotor function of the upper limb. There are many scales that assess this variable. Fugl-Meyer Assessment is one of the most widely used, but there are many versions of this scale to assess this construct.
Purpose
To identify, critically appraise, and summarize the different Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) versions to recognize which is better to measure upper-extremity sensorimotor function in stroke patients.
Study Design
A psychometric systematic review was carried out in this research.
Methods
An exhaustive search was conducted during June and July 2023 in the following databases: Pubmed, Web of Science (WoS), Open Grey, Scielo, Cochrane, Dialnet, and LILACS. By the most updated consensus-based standards fot the selection of health status Measurement INstruments methodology (COSMIN) and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements for a systematic review of the measurement properties of existing patient-reported outcome measures to select the most appropriate outcome measurement instrument. The protocol of this systematic review was registered in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/dy54p/).
Results
About 22 versions of the FMA were identified in 36 studies. The Upper Extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) was the version most frequently analyzed (n = 13) among the included articles.
Conclusions
Fugl-Meyer Assessment (Full version, 50 items, FMA) was the questionnaire version with the most evaluated psychometric characteristics and most translations, with the better score regarding the quality of evidence, which indicates that is the recommended FMA version to assess upper-extremity sensorimotor function in stroke patients.

AB  - Fuel truck parking lots are crucial components of transportation networks, facilitating the storage and organization of fuel trucks to ensure efficient fuel distribution. These facilities play a vital role in minimizing transportation delays and reducing emissions. However, the proximity of fuel tanks in these lots poses inherent risks, including fire, explosions, and domino accidents. The present study aimed to analyze the domino effect in fuel truck parking lots. To achieve this, a hybrid approach combining the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) method with the Bayesian networks (BNs) was employed for quantitative cause-consequence analysis. Additionally, empirical equations were utilized to model the consequences, followed by the dynamic analysis of the domino effect using the Multi-Agent (MA) method. The accuracy of the introduced hybrid method was evaluated through a case study conducted at one of the most sizable parking lots. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed approach in quantifying risks and identifying mitigation strategies, highlighting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the proposed hybrid model offers a scientifically rigorous framework for handling uncertainty, providing valuable insights for enhancing safety measures and mitigating risks in fuel truck parking lots.

AB  - Background
Three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis has the potential to assess dynamic spasticity (DS). However, little is known about which parameters can be utilized for assessment.
Objective
To evaluate the application of 3D gait analysis in assessing DS during walking and to identify the most relevant parameters for clinical practice.
Methods
A systematic scoping review was conducted by a multidisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians. A literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was conducted using the following inclusion criteria: (i) clinical trial study; (ii) focused on the relationship between spasticity and gait analysis indicators during walking. The risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data were analyzed using content analysis and quantification techniques.
Results
Four key parameters in 3D gait analysis—spatiotemporal parameters, kinematics, kinetics, and myoelectric signals—are utilized to evaluate alterations in DS during walking. Among the spatiotemporal parameters, the most frequently used metrics are speed, stride length, and cadence. In kinematics, the ankle and knee joint angles are the most commonly measured indicators. For kinetics, the ankle joint moment and plantar pressure are the primary focus. For myoelectric signals, the most utilized metrics include the patterns and duration of muscle co-contraction.
Conclusions
3D gait analysis is feasible for precisely evaluating DS during walking. However, to obtain a comprehensive evaluation, it is essential to integrate multiple metrics. High-quality research is urgently needed to provide more precise assessment protocols by analyzing changes in gait parameters before and after spasticity interventions.

AB  - In recent years, mechanisms of cooperation in power systems have attracted increasing attention from academia and industry. Such mechanisms require sharing the benefits of cooperation among participants based on some rational and obvious principles. In this regard, Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) provides a rich theoretical background for the analysis of projects where participants (called players) can make collective actions to obtain mutual benefits. CGT concepts not only solve the subsequent allocation problems but also reveal the bargaining power of players and estimate the stability of cooperation over a project. In this paper, we aim to classify and promote CGT applications in power systems. While covering a broad range of applications (such as cost and benefit allocation, transmission pricing, projects ranking, allocation of power losses), we pay particular attention to power system expansion planning. We first introduce an illustrative example of cooperation in transmission expansion planning and discuss the applicability of CGT solution concepts. To give a complete picture of the state of the art, we perform a citation network analysis of more than 3000 related studies from 1996 to 2020. Exploiting the graph layout and modularity algorithms, we identify the main research communities and highlight their contributions. We found that significant progress has been achieved in developing mechanisms of cooperation in power systems based on CGT solution concepts. However, several challenges and limitations of these concepts still have to be overcome, such as scalability, nonconvexity of cooperative games, coalitions formation assumption, ex-post game-theoretic analysis, incompleteness and manipulability of information. The overview presented in this paper and the citation network analysis performed can help scientists and engineers in comprehending the CGT solution concepts, discovering novel applications for power systems, and contributing to this promising multidisciplinary research direction.

AB  - Resumen
La histerectomía es una de las intervenciones ginecológicas más frecuentes en todo el mundo. En ocasiones, esta cirugía puede generar importantes cambios en los aspectos emocionales, psíquicos, anatómicos y sociales, lo que puede alterar el funcionamiento sexual en las mujeres que la padezcan. El objetivo de esta búsqueda es analizar el impacto sobre la función sexual en mujeres histerectomizadas por motivos benignos. Durante el mes de enero de 2018 se llevó a cabo una búsqueda sistemática en las bases de datos Medline, Cinahl, PubMed, LILACS, Scopus y Web of Science. Tras aplicar los criterios de inclusión y exclusión seleccionados, se obtuvieron un total de 15 artículos en los cuales se analizaron entre otros la enfermedad de base, el tipo de intervención y el ítem alterado en la función sexual. Como conclusión, existe cierta controversia sobre los efectos de la histerectomía sobre la sexualidad, aunque la mayoría determina que tras la cirugía se produce una mejora en la función sexual.
Hysterectomy is one of the most frequent gynaecological interventions in the world. This surgery can sometimes generate important changes in the emotional, psychic, anatomical and social aspects, including alterations of sexual functioning in women who suffer from it. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact on sexual function in women hysterectomised for benign reasons. During the month of January 2018 a systematic search was carried out in the databases Medline, Cinahl, PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science. After applying the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 15 articles were obtained. An analysis was performed on variables such as the basic pathology, type of intervention, and altered items in sexual function. As a conclusion, there is some controversy over the effects of hysterectomy on sexuality, although most determine that an improvement in sexual function occurs after the surgery.

AB  - The global agri-food industry generates a large volume of waste annually, which causes both environmental and economic problems. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of agri-food wastes and by-products to produce self-sufficient fish feed. This study aimed to analyze the intellectual structure of the recent research on the utilization of agri-food wastes and by-products as self-sufficient fish feed materials based on 922 Scopus-indexed core collection documents from 252 journals written by 4420 authors from 73 countries with an annual growth rate of 18.65% over the last four years (2019–2022). This bibliometric study implemented knowledge domain visualization (KDV) using VOSViewer and Biblioshiny in the Bibliometrix R-package to investigate the basic scientometric profile of the selected fields. The results showed that Dawood M.A.O., with PageRanks of 0.0732, 19 total publications, 695 global citations from 2019 to 2022, and closeness values of 0.25, was the most productive author within the field. Subsequently, China was determined to be the most productive country (93 valid documents) and have the strongest collaboration network. Major research hotspots in the field included aquaculture and sustainable aquaculture, fish feed with agri-food waste, rainbow trout species, the development of a circular economy, probiotic applications, and cell signaling cytokines and peptides. This bibliometric study provides comprehensive information on the intellectual domain and research landscape on self-sufficient fish feed and also shows how interest in this research topic and similar ones is growing.

AB  - Modular construction (MC) is an increasingly important construction technique. However, it also requires the use of sophisticated scheduling algorithms. A comprehensive literature review of different scheduling systems used for prefabricated construction, was conducted using the PRISMA methodology. Over 500 relevant papers were analysed and 59 critical applications of production scheduling metaheuristics were closely examined. However, very few of these were for modular construction. This paper provides a deep analysis of GA applications in scheduling and the newer techniques using PSO, SA and ACO. The results of the review suggest 6 directions for future research namely, (i) Consideration of added complexities, (ii) Responsiveness of the scheduling system to new tenders or work, (iii) Integrating production scheduling with Manufacturing Execution and Control Systems, (iv) Dynamic scheduling, (v) Simulation-based optimization techniques for MC, (vi) Use of AI and machine learning concepts for MC. This paper will inform better production scheduling of MC projects.

AB  - Decision-making problems, particularly in transformation and planning processes, often involve multiple conflicting objectives/criteria that should be considered. However, it is possible to distinguish between two different types of problems. In the first type, a predefined and discrete set of alternatives has to be evaluated. In the second type, conversely, the set of suitable solutions is not explicated in advance but requires constraint functions for its definition. Alternative generation for choice problems is a vital activity in decision analysis that is sometimes overlooked and underdeveloped. Within this context, the present contribution proposes an integrated approach for supporting a participatory process of scenario planning. This approach combines three interrelated steps. Firstly, data pertaining to the context are collected using SWOT and Stakeholder Analysis. Secondly, the elicitation of preferences expressed by the main stakeholders involved in the planning process is conducted through a multicriteria method. Thirdly, a multi-agent system (MAS) supports the scenario building phase. MAS takes into account both the satisfaction of citizens' and stakeholders' preferences and the comprehensive sustainability of the site, according to a set of multi-dimensional indicators. The generation of alternative scenarios is contingent upon the consideration of preferences and sustainable performance, but also on the suitability of current and new land uses, which are based on a rich set of data elaborated through a Geographic Information System (GIS). The case study of Basse di Stura in Turin (Italy) represents a useful example to test the applicability of this integrated approach. This is due to the fact that the transformation in this area is at an impasse, due to the high pollution of the soil and the different perspectives of the stakeholders involved. The results reveal the ability of this integrated approach in facilitating the development of participatory solutions, that can take into account sustainable objectives, stakeholders' needs and the specificity of the context under analysis.
