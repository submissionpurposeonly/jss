AB  - The objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review of scientific literature regarding socio-environmental disclosure. For this purpose, the Scopus and Web of Science journal databases were used to collect primary studies. Subsequently, the content of the abstracts was extracted using the content analysis technique. The analysis period of the corpus spans from 2009 to 2024, encompassing a total of 113 primary studies. The research protocol developed by Tranfield et al. (2003) was used, considering its stages: (i) review planning, (ii) review conduction, and (iii) report writing and dissemination of results. Additionally, the data from the final corpus were processed using the bibliometric software VOSviewer and Bibliometrix for comprehensive scientific mapping analysis. The analyzed results of the corpus indicate that the theme still has room for exploration in future studies. A co-citation analysis of the documents was also conducted, revealing three clusters of complementary strands: environmental disclosure practices, sustainability assurance, and organizational legitimacy. The corpus words were evaluated, revealing a measured association between construct performance (disclosure and corporate social responsibility - CSR) and other keywords. Among the pairs of words with statistically significant associations are “performance” and “organizations,” as well as “legitimacy.” These associations demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between the various measurement indicators related to Socio-environmental Disclosure. Finally, a list of future research proposals was provided so that those interested in the explored theme can further deepen their analysis of the knowledge on the subject in question.

AB  - Every year in Newfoundland, young Atlantic puffins, Fratercula arctica, departing their nests at night for the first time become stranded in towns near their breeding colonies, a phenomenon thought to be caused by attraction towards artificial light. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among high-pressure sodium (HPS), Warm white light-emitting diode (LED), Cool white LED, Blue LED and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation and husbandry programmes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic puffin strandings is the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine whether aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.

AB  - The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has been instrumental in the optimization of friction stir welding (FSW) parameters. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), were utilized to predict mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and optimize pivotal welding parameters, such as rotational speed, feed rate, axial force, and tilt angle. These methodologies enabled precise real-time control, thus improving the quality and consistency of the resulting welded joints. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in friction stir welding (FSW). The objective of the study was to synthesize existing research using AI to predict mechanical properties and optimize welding parameters. Furthermore, the study aimed to illustrate how artificial intelligence has improved the caliber and dependability of FSW joints through real-time observation and defect identification. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on the utilization of AI in FSW. A search algorithm was applied to databases such as ScienceDirect and Web of Science, resulting in the identification of 27 relevant scientific papers. The selection criteria were designed to identify studies that employed AI techniques for the prediction and optimization of FSW parameters. The principal findings indicated the pervasive deployment of 34 distinct AI techniques, with ANN being the most prevalent. Hybrid models combining AI with optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms, were particularly effective. These models demonstrated high precision in predicting tensile strength and detecting internal defects, significantly improving joint quality. In conclusion, AI applications in FSW have proven essential for optimizing welding processes, with hybrid AI models showing superior performance. The continued integration of AI in FSW is expected to enhance the efficiency and reliability of welding operations, offering significant industrial advantages.

AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) play an important role in climate mitigation and decarbonization strategies. Many researchers have studied Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), but few have identified the barriers and drivers from a bibliometric perspective. This research aims to fill this gap by providing bibliometric analysis, while also identifying research trends and topic evolution in this field. The analysis revealed that China and the USA are leading the research activities in this topic. Five conceptual themes were identified from the literature through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) keyword clustering: life cycle assessment and sequestration, technological advances in CO2 capture and separations, techno-economic analysis, CO2 conversion technologies, and metallic organic framework. Furthermore, an analysis of the co-occurrence network map using the keyword plus bibliometric data suggests that the barriers and drivers of CCS and CCU are not universally shared across the CCUS field. The recognition of these differences may support further research in the development of supportive policies and could provide input into the creation of new business models. The primary contribution of this research is a comprehensive bibliometric analysis detailing the current state, thematic areas, and the barriers and drivers associated with CCS and CCU, while also outlining future research directions.

AB  - Since the discovery of insulin, its parenteral use has been discouraged by the inadequacy of the treatment protocol such as action on non-target sites and liver-compromised effects. Eventually, this results in peripheral insulin resistance and immunogenicity. In contrast, oral insulin delivery has become a popular and well-accepted approach that enables hepatic insulin action via portal circulation to regulate glucose output. Indeed, such action is crucial for preserving glucose homeostasis. However, the primary challenge is associated with the gastrointestinal barrier. Polymeric micelles (PMs) formed from amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs) specially designed for oral insulin using stimuli-responsive moieties, polysaccharide-based blocks, charge reversible blocks, etc. in the form of zwitterionic PMs, complex PMs, and dual/multi-responsive PMs can overcome the limitations. Their self-assembly at lower critical micelle concentration (0.1–1 µM) offers higher thermodynamic stability. Eventually, this makes them unique over other nanoparticles. Thus, PMs harness the potential to improve the efficacy of insulin by providing ease of administration, controlled systemic exposure, prolonged residence time, and broad flexibility and tunability. However, toxicity and inadequate release are claimed to be major concerns for PMs. In this work, we have scrutinised the critical molecular features of ABCs influencing the physicochemical characteristics of PMs for spatiotemporal insulin release. Herein, we discuss key issues that restrict their translation to the clinical practice followed by opportunities that can be used to overcome the same for the success of oral insulin PMs.

AB  - The global hospitality industry is undergoing a profound transformation, primarily driven by the internet era within the context of Industry 4.0 and the continuous evolution of the metaverse. The metaverse offers limitless possibilities for creating immersive and personalized accommodation experiences by closely integrating the virtual with the real world. It also provides a new perspective and mindset for guiding the hospitality industry to rethink and redesign service models and business processes. Although the metaverse application in the hospitality industry has already made significant progress, this process still faces numerous barriers, and the specific application scenarios of the metaverse hospitality industry (MHI) remain unclear. This study aims to develop an integrated decision support framework for exploring the barriers and potential application scenarios in metaverse hospitality. First, the interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) is introduced to quantify the complex and uncertain information in the decision-making procedure. Second, the IT2F-BWM with the IT2F weighted averaging (IT2FWA) operator is proposed to calculate the barriers’ weights considering the group opinions. Third, the IT2FWA operator and IT2F-ExpTODIM method are incorporated to prioritize the potential application scenarios in MHI. Finally, a case study on the prioritization of barriers and application scenarios in MHI is utilized to test the effectiveness and practicality of the presented framework. Results show that the technology barrier (0.5217) and the interaction technology (0.2483) have the highest levels among the main and sub-main barrier hierarchies, respectively. The findings of this article may enrich the theories of uncertain decision-making methods and provide instructive suggestions for the operation and management of metaverse hospitality practice.

AB  - Information systems are crucial for companies to enhance strategic decision-making based on strategic watch. Keeping informed about the evolution of the sector is crucial for maintaining a sustainable and resilient supply chain, which is essential for a company's success. To improve competitiveness and anticipate market trends, such as detecting weak signals (early signs of emerging concepts e.g., DDMRP a few years ago), AI can accelerate the monitoring process that typically includes four main phases: defining needs, collecting data, ranking documents, and disseminating results. We present our collective intelligence-based approach of a semi-automatic technological watch information system for the perfumery-cosmetics sector.

AB  - The agri-food sector has come under increasing pressure to increase safety standards. Both consumers and expert authorities are demanding that the agri-food chain implement higher levels of traceability and transparency to make the system less susceptible to fraud and to ensure higher quality. These needs have become even more pressing following food scandals that occurred in the 2000s. Recent European policies have supported the growth of technological and digital innovations in firms, recognizing that digitization has a strategic role to play in modernizing the agri-food sector and moving toward ecological transition. This paper aims to verify whether blockchain's cutting-edge technology can provide effective technical and strategic support to the agri-food system in achieving the aforementioned goals. A total of 123 articles underwent descriptive analysis and network analysis focusing on the topic of blockchain in the agri-food context. The methods used were the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol and VOSviewer software. The results highlight the growing importance of (and increased interest in) blockchain and its functionality when applied to the agri-food sector.

AB  - We empirically investigate the effect of electronic case-processing on court efficacy. We draw on monthly court-level panel data on adjudication and enforcement in Brazilian labor justice, a major pillar of the Brazilian justice system where electronic case-processing is a recent phenomenon and court inefficacy has been a pervasive concern. Using dynamic panel methods and multiple estimation approaches to address endogeneity, we show, first and foremost, that in both adjudication and enforcement a shift to electronic case-processing unequivocally increases judicial productivity and court clearance rate while reducing case disposition times. In adjudication, electronification exhibits diminishing marginal returns: additional electronification does not yield further efficacy gains once the share of electronically-processed court caseload is between 50% and 75%. We do not find similarly stark evidence of plateauing of the effect of electronification in enforcement, a key court activity domain where attaining fully electronic case-processing would thus be especially advantageous. Overall, our findings suggest that electronic case-processing provides one viable path to unclogging courts and enhancing administration of justice.

AB  - In recent decades, sustainability has surged as a pivotal topic in academic discourse, driven by heightened global awareness of its critical role in addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequities. Consequently, cities and local authorities are increasingly prioritizing sustainability integration into urban development strategies. However, the realization of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals faces challenges, with only 12–15 % of targets estimated to be met by the 2030 deadline. Scholars attribute this under-performance to the absence of a comprehensive approach to sustainable urban development. This study investigates the framework and mechanisms of mature future cities’ theories in achieving sustainability, focusing on sustainable urban development principles. Through a systematic review utilizing Natural Language Processing and statistical analysis of over 27,000 SCOPUS documents, the research evaluates 43 future cities’ theories from 1900 to 2023. Criteria such as comprehensiveness, consistency, empirical support, and applicability to sustainable development are analyzed. The study identifies mature theories like Smart City, Resilient City, and Sustainable City as promising avenues for sustainable urban development, albeit requiring refinement. The findings offer valuable insights to guide research and practice towards achieving sustainable urban development in cities.

AB  - Interdisciplinary scientific fields, such as synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and human brain science, often emerge at the intersection of existing scientific disciplines. This fundamental process is described in the literature streams of ‘science convergence’ and the ‘evolution of new scientific fields’. However, despite their empirical relevance and the potential for science convergence to accelerate the evolution of these new fields, the two concepts have been developed separately up to this point. In this study, we therefore investigate the interplay between the two concepts by first conducting a systematic review of the literature on science convergence to examine its underlying dynamics. We then integrate the concept of science convergence into the current understanding of the evolutionary process of new scientific fields, leading to a new theoretical conceptualization and typology of the different pathways in the evolution of interdisciplinary scientific fields. The pathways exhibit varying levels of interdisciplinary research activities at different stages of the evolutionary process. We apply this typology to cases of synthetic biology, bioinformatics, and human brain science, illustrating how science convergence and an early emphasis on interdisciplinary research activities drive the evolutionary process of a new scientific field. In essence, our typology and its related proxies enable policymakers and other actors to understand how science convergence gives rise to new interdisciplinary scientific fields.

AB  - Investigative genetic genealogy has emerged as an effective investigation tool in the last few years, gaining popularity, especially after the arrest of the Golden State Killer. Since then, hundreds of cases have been reported to be solved thanks to this novel and promising technique. Unsurprisingly, this success also led law enforcement authorities in the EU to experiment with it. However, there is an ambiguity on which legal basis in the EU data protection framework should be used to access the personal data of genetic genealogy database users for investigative purposes, which may put the legality and legitimacy of investigative genetic genealogy in Europe at stake. Accordingly, this article examines whether the “manifestly made public by the data subject” legal basis enshrined in Article 10(c) of the Law Enforcement Directive could be used for such purposes. Based on its analysis, the article argues that this legal basis cannot be used for such purposes, given that the personal data in question are not “manifestly made” “public”, and they are not disclosed “by the data subject” in all cases. Therefore, the article concludes by suggesting a way forward to ensure the lawfulness of this investigation method in the EU data protection framework.

This chapter presents descriptive evidence about the evolution of us housing prices, quantities, and regulations since 1980, indicating that supply constraints appear to be increasingly binding. We then provide an overview of the various approaches used to model construction and land development for homogeneous and heterogeneous housing in static and dynamic contexts to understand housing supply. Our treatment incorporates empirical implementation and policy implications throughout. Finally, we provide an overview of quantitative evidence on the consequences of relaxing various types of supply constraints.

AB  - Plant microbial fuel cells represent an innovative type of microbial fuel cell technology, utilizing plant rhizodeposition to fuel electrochemically active bacteria on the anode surface, thereby generating bioelectricity. This study delves into some botanical aspects of plant species employed in PMFCs and Constructed Wetland PMFCs, aiming to investigate whether their bioelectrical performance is influenced by Raunkiær life forms and root architecture. Our study involved 40 plant species described in 38 documents. In some cases, nomenclature issues prevented the interpretation of actual species used in the experiments. The bioelectrical performance of PMFCs appeared to be significantly affected by both life forms and root architecture. Therophytes and Hemicriptophytes exhibited higher median values than the other life forms, while the Geophyte group showed very high power density values despite a lower median value. In contrast, CW-PMFCs do not appeared to be significantly affected by the botanical traits considered, likely due to the limited data collected on this experimental configuration. The plant species that performed the best in PMFCs include Carex hirta, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Glyceria maxima and Canna indica, all of which have an adventitious root system. C. hirta, G. maxima and C. indica are geophytes, while A. plantago-aquatica is a hydrophyte. Consequently, epiphytes, chamaephytes and nanophanerophytes, as well as plants with fibrous root systems, appeared to be not recommended for PMFCs. Nevertheless, the results of our study may have certain limitation due to nomenclature issues that prevented the accurate identification of species used in the PMFCs, the absence of a standardized benchmark for electrical measurement, and the lack of clear match between each species and its bioelectrical performance, reducing the data pool.

AB  - Introduction
Advancements in resuscitative care and burn surgery have improved survival rates after extensive burn injuries, shifting focus to enhancing the quality of survival. Conventional treatment with split-thickness skin grafts (STSG) presents limitations such as donor-site morbidity, limited availability in extensive burn injuries, and hypertrophic scarring. Tissue engineering aims to address these drawbacks by developing optimal skin substitutes. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current applications of cultured cells in burn surgery, encompassing diverse approaches and addressing existing challenges to enhance burn wound management and improve patient outcomes.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was performed across three databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for articles on cultured cell use in burn treatment. Only clinical studies were included. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Quality assessment was performed.
Results
The search yielded 167 articles, of which 14 met the eligibility criteria. The selection included 8 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective cohort trials, and 1 retrospective cohort study. Various tissue-engineered skin substitutes, from cultured epidermal autografts to dermal regeneration templates seeded with cultured cells, showed promising outcomes. Several substitutes exhibited take rates comparable to STSG with improved scar quality.
Conclusion
Results are promising, though standardization of cultured skin substitutes and robust clinical trials with larger populations and appropriate comparators are still lacking.

AB  - Wildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses. These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs — topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.

AB  - This paper examines the economic value of marine and coastal ecosystem services by analyzing 67 studies published in scientific literature. It appraises, collects, and analyzes economic valuations, combining a systematic literature review and meta-analysis regressions. The studies focus on ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, marine waters, and mangrove forests, with recreation, tourism, and fishing being the most valued services. The economic value ranges for provisioning services are between $99 to $1535 per hectare per year, cultural services are between $45 to $2170 per hectare per year, and recreation and tourism services range from $185 to $895 per individual per year. However, the estimates should be used with caution due to the limited number of publications and the use of value transfer techniques. This paper’s findings can help develop future research for academics and practitioners communities and inform policy discussions about preserving these valuable ecosystems in the context of the climate crisis.

AB  - Despite the environmental benefits of composting, recent studies worldwide have highlighted the emergence of microplastics (MPs) in compost, posing a potential threat to soil health. This systematic review summarizes existing research on MPs pollution in compost, emphasizing abundance, sources, characteristics, potential ecological risks, and future perspectives. 19 studies from different countries, mostly China, were included in the review. Compost types analyzed included animal manures, sewage sludge, municipal solid waste (MSW), and organic solid waste. Fibers, fragments, and films were the most common shapes, and most of these MPs were between 0.5 to 3 mm in size. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are among the most frequently identified polymers. MPs abundance ranged from 0 to 2.88 × 105 items/kg, with the highest levels in chicken manure and animal/plant mixtures. Primary MPs sources were MSW, sewage sludge, animal manure and plant residues. Using the Hazard Index (H), the ecological risk assessment revealed a high risk (H > 100) for certain composts. Further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of MPs in compost on soil health and ecosystem functioning. Waste management and treatment processes need to be improved to reduce MPs pollution in compost raw materials. This review highlights the growing problem of MPs in compost and the need for targeted mitigation strategies.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role in data collection for a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across remote, urban, and marine environments. In large-scale deployments, UAVs often face complex decision-making challenges, for which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution. This paper presents a comprehensive review of research on UAV-assisted IoT utilizing DRL, covering key research questions relating to DRL algorithm variants, deployment objectives, architectural features, integrated technologies, UAV roles, optimization constraints, energy management strategies, and performance metrics. Findings indicate that value-based and actor-critic algorithms are the most commonly employed, targeting objectives such as path planning, transmit power control, scheduling, velocity and altitude control, and charging optimization. Other architectural considerations include clustering, security, obstacle avoidance, buffered sensors, and multi-UAV coordination. Beyond data collection, UAVs are also used for tasks such as device selection, data aggregation, and sensor charging, with energy management primarily achieved through charging and energy harvesting techniques. Performance is typically assessed using metrics like energy efficiency, throughput, latency, packet loss, and Age of Information (AoI). The paper concludes by outlining several promising research directions and open challenges critical to the successful deployment of UAVs as aerial communication platforms, especially in IoT data collection. By organizing existing work across key themes and outlining promising future directions, this review offers a valuable reference for researchers and technology professionals alike.

AB  - Objective
Given the uncertainty surrounding the most effective exercise prescription variables (frequency, intensity, type, duration) and the impact of Parkinson’s disease (PD) characteristics (illness duration, age, severity, baseline cognitive status, levodopa dosage) on different subdomains of executive function (EF) improvement, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with moderator analysis to assess these effects.
Method
Six electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, AGELINE) were searched by two independent authors. Clinical trials published before April 2024 that reported the effect of chronic exercise on EF in individuals with PD were included.
Results
Of 608 identified studies, 18 studies met eligibility criteria. The overall effect size (ES) of exercise on EF was small but positive and significant (ES= 0.21, p < .001). Among EF subdomains, cognitive flexibility showed significant improvement. Regarding exercise prescription, larger ES were observed for high (≥2 per week) frequency, moderate to vigorous intensity, mind-body exercise, and 45–60 min for each session. Sample characteristics such as older age, high levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) (≥600 mg/day), and baseline cognitive impairment were found to attenuate the effect of exercise on EF.
Conclusion
Exercise is a promising non-pharmacological intervention for enhancing EF in PD, particularly improving cognitive flexibility. Mind-body exercises appear particularly effective. Recommended programs should be moderate to vigorous in intensity, lasting 45–60 min, and conducted at least twice weekly for 13–16 weeks. The benefits of exercise diminish with age and with LEDD exceeding 600 mg/day. Additionally, PD patients with cognitive impairments may experience reduced benefits. Early exercise engagement is recommended, while disease severity and duration have minimal impact.

AB  - Phytophthora comprise the most destructive plant pathogens, affecting over 1,000 plant species and causing severe diseases such as root rot. Traditional chemical control methods may pose environmental risks and can contribute to resistance development, making alternative strategies such as the implementation of biological control organisms (BCOs) essential. This study presents a meta-analysis evaluating factors that influence the success of BCOs against Phytophthora root rot in annual crops. Systematic data collection and statistical analyses of 49 studies comprising 355 BCO treatments resulted in key insights into the most effective BCO application methods. Root and soil treatments were significantly more effective than seed treatments. Co-application of BCOs with pathogen inoculation enhanced efficacy, likely due to direct antagonism, particularly when specialized metabolites were delivered alongside bacterial BCOs. Strikingly, greenhouse and field trials demonstrated higher BCO efficacy than growth chamber experiments, emphasizing the importance of trial environments. Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) identified distinct clusters of BCO treatments, revealing clear associations between BCO application methods and efficacy. These findings highlight the need for optimized application methods and formulations to maximize BCO stability and efficacy, potentially enhancing their role in integrated pest management strategies.

AB  - The IMO’s 2023 revised targets increase pressure on shipping and trading organisations to urgently cut energy consumption and transition away from fossil fuels. Although there are several alternative fuel options for shipping, ammonia is a prominent contender. Green ammonia is produced from renewable hydrogen with no direct CO2 emissions when combusted, making it an important option to interrogate. This research uses a mixed methods approach, including analysing shipping stakeholders’ perspectives, to consider the full range of factors relating to its deployment and use. Challenges to its adoption include low fleet renewal as a result of uncertainties around being first movers, managing NOx and N2O emissions if used in a combustion engine and lack of economic incentives. Nevertheless, green ammonia's storage advantages over hydrogen, established experience of ammonia handling for the fertiliser industry and its direct emission free application in fuel cells, underpin interest in its development. The study emphasizes though that the on-ground realities of transitioning away from fossil fuels require significant developments across the entire fuel supply chain. This extends beyond considerations around ammonia’s technological viability and encompass changes needed to onboard and portside infrastructure, incentives to accelerate retrofit and fleet renewal, and recognition of risks posed by first-movers in the sector. Furthermore, with short timeliness associated with Paris targets, and anticipated rising costs of new fuel infrastructure, there is an imperative to implement mitigation policy that focuses on urgently reducing reliance on liquid fuels, while alternative fuel deployment is established at scale.

However, the knowledge of what and how stories connected to destinations are told and utilized is still fragmented and ambiguous. To acquire a comprehensive understanding of storytelling in the context of destination marketing, this study employs a systematic review methodology to analyze academic journal articles on relevant topics published and indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2004 to 2023. Three research themes have been identified including: 1) analysis and deconstruction of stories; 2) examination of storytelling consequences; and 3) development of conceptual frameworks for storytelling. Moreover, storytelling elements are also disentangled and extracted. The findings suggest that research on storytelling in destination marketing is still in its emerging stage, lacking appropriate and comprehensive theoretical underpinnings and predominantly relying on qualitative analysis. The results indicate the design and implementation of storytelling in destination is a complex and integrated process that combines story content, storyteller and character, modality, and dissemination channels, involving collaboration among various stakeholders. This study also provides a summary of implications for researchers and practitioners in tourism destination area, offering further recommendations for future studies.

AB  - Cities in emerging economies, especially in Africa, are grappling with transport problems, such as congestion, service fragmentation, inadequate infrastructure and long travel times and distances. These issues negatively impact the liveability of African cities. Despite the potential of smart mobility to address some issues, there is a notable gap in research exploring the aspects of smart mobility that are applicable and effective in the context of emerging economies. This paper explores smart mobility research trends in Africa. A bibliometric analysis technique was used to extract 608 documents from the Scopus and Web of Science core collections, which were analysed using Biblioshiny in R. The results reveal that many studies focused solely on technological solutions, are fragmented, and lack network- or city-wide mobility solutions. Previous research has not considered user perspectives or the likely socio-economic impact of smart mobility. The growth in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, coupled with the need for personalised and seamless travel, is driving smart mobility research in Africa. Most papers were authored by researchers with African affiliations but based at foreign institutions. The African countries represented are limited to Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. There are also low levels of intra-African research collaboration. Further, only 14 documents specifically focused on transport in Africa. Future research should focus on integrating various transport options to achieve customised and sustainable transport solutions. The paper explores a multifaceted concept in the context of emerging economies and provides a research agenda.

AB  - Image caption generation has become a prominent area of research due to its potential applications in multimedia understanding and accessibility. This paper presents a comprehensive study of three state-of-the-art approaches for image caption generation, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Attention mechanisms, and Transformers. The first approach utilizes a CNN-LSTM architecture, where the CNN acts as an encoder to extract meaningful visual features from input images. These features are then fed into an LSTM-based decoder, enabling the generation of descriptive captions. The second approach introduces the use of Attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on specific regions of the image while generating captions. This technique improves the caption quality and ensures that the generated text corresponds more accurately to the content in the image. Lastly, the third approach incorporates the powerful Transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in the generated captions, enabling better contextual understanding and coherence. Based on an in-depth literature review and a comparative analysis of image caption generators utilizing CNN-LSTM, attention mechanisms, and Transformers, the findings converge to highlight the Transformer approach's superiority in terms of accuracy. Although the CNN-LSTM model excels in generating coherent captions, its limitations in capturing nuanced context restrict its accuracy potential. While attention mechanisms enhance context understanding, they introduce computational intricacies.

Based on an analysis of 61 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science and Business Source Ultimate databases, the review addresses three central research questions: (1) What is the current state of the literature on Sustainable Performance Measurement? (2) Which ESG factors can be integrated into a Sustainable Performance Measurement System for companies to maximize information output while minimizing the number of required factors? (3) How can ESG factors be measured to contribute to improvements and long-term sustainability value creation for corporations? The analysis reveals a marked and sustained rise in scholarly attention to Sustainable Performance Measurement between 2004 and 2024, with the number of publications more than doubling between the periods 2014–2017 and 2018–2021. While most studies consider all three ESG dimensions, environmental factors receive the most attention—frequently alongside governance and, to a lesser extent, social aspects such as working conditions, diversity, and stakeholder impact. This review synthesizes major developments in the field, including the design of individual frameworks, decision support models, and composite indexes for ESG performance assessment. It identifies the most relevant ESG components for inclusion in PMSs and critically evaluates how these factors are currently measured, offering insights into their practical contribution to corporate performance improvement.

AB  - The quest to find reliable biomarkers in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is an ongoing endeavour to identify both underlying causes and measurable indicators of this neurodevelopmental condition. Machine learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) techniques have enhanced biomarker identification in neuroimaging and behavioral studies, aiding in diagnostic accuracy and early detection. This review paper examines the transformative impact of applying machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL) techniques such as transfer learning and transformer architectures, in advancing ASD diagnosis. The review begins by critically assessing existing literature utilizing ML techniques like logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines in identifying biomarkers that could potentially aid in the diagnosis of ASD and differentiate between ASD and neurotypical individuals. The focus then shifts to DL models, including Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks, to evaluate their suitability for identifying complex patterns linked to ASD. Addressing limited datasets, the review examines transfer learning with pre-trained models, including VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, Inception, and Xception architectures. Additionally, using the ABIDE-I dataset, VGG19, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121 were applied, evaluating their performance through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The review further considers transformer architectures, such as Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, Spatial Temporal Transformers, BolT Transformer, and Convolutional Network Transformer for capturing long-range dependencies in ASD diagnosis. This review aims to be an essential reference for researchers exploring the field of AI-powered ASD diagnosis and classification, by offering analysis of various approaches and highlighting recent advancements.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy education mainly targets secondary and university students, often overlooking the unique needs of younger students. This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.

AB  - The management of human resources is today significantly impacted by the emergence of the global workforce and the increasing relevance of business analytics as a strategic organizational capability. Whereas human resources analytics has been largely discussed in literature in the last decade, a systematic identification and classification of key topics is yet to be introduced. In particular, there is room for conceptual contributions aiming to provide a comprehensive definition of concepts and investigation areas related to HR analytics. Using a systematic literature review process, we deconstruct the concept of human resources analytics as presented in a vast although fragmented literature, and we identify 106 key research topics associated to three major areas, i.e. enablers of HR analytics (technological and organizational), applications (descriptive and diagnostic/prescriptive), and value (employee value and organizational value). We also speculate on an “exponential” view of HR analytics enabled by the affirmation of artificial intelligence and cognitive technologies. The article provides a large systematization effort and a research agenda for developing further studies in the field of HR analytics. By a practitioner perspective, the study offers insights to support the design of innovative analytics projects within organizations.

AB  - Background & Aims
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a severe, life-threatening condition for some patients. This systematic review aimed to identify and rank early prognostic factors associated with reduced survival in AIH.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted in Ovid Medline and embase.com up to April 2024 for identifying early prognostic factors for the combined endpoints of death or liver transplantation and liver-related death or liver transplantation. Overview tables of prognostic factors were constructed to outline the number of studies, the respective effect direction and statistical significance. Meta-analysis was performed if at least three studies reported on a factor. The level of certainty in evidence was evaluated using the GRADE guideline.
Results
Thirty-three studies were included, and 44 prognostic factors were investigated in at least two studies. Cirrhosis at diagnosis (HR 3.21, 95% CI 2.38-4.34) and insufficient response to therapy (HR 4.35, 95% CI 2.5-7.58) were significant predictors with the highest risk ratios. Additional factors associated with reduced survival include advanced age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, variant syndrome with PSC, asymptomatic presentation, higher relapse rates and elevated INR, creatinine, ALP/AST ratio, and MELD score. Protective factors include elevated baseline levels of aminotransferases and albumin levels.
Conclusion
Cirrhosis and insufficient treatment response are the prognostic factors with the highest impact on reduced survival in AIH. Other risk factors include advanced age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, PSC-variant syndrome, asymptomatic presentation, higher relapse rates and elevated INR, creatinine, ALP/AST ratio, and MELD score, while elevated baseline aminotransferases and albumin are protective.

AB  - Background
Breastfeeding is a fundamental practice for child and maternal health, recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). However, despite its proven benefits, exclusive breastfeeding rates remain suboptimal in many countries. Mothers' motivation plays a crucial role in the initiation, continuation and prolongation of breastfeeding, but various factors can negatively influence this motivation.
Aim
This research explores the complex motivational dynamics surrounding breastfeeding, encompassing both the intrinsic motivation of mothers and the motivational interventions of health professionals.
Methods
A systematic review encompassing both qualitative and quantitative inquiries, was undertaken. Research questions were formulated, and a search strategy devised, to review PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science repositories, with a retrospective scope spanning the past three decades, applying filters and eligibility criteria. We included scientific articles whose participants were healthy mothers aged 18-48 years with uncomplicated eutocic deliveries, together with their healthy full-term infants. The study aimed to analyze the motivation for breastfeeding from the prenatal stage to prolongation beyond the two years recommended by the WHO.
Findings
A total of 23 studies, from a variety of perspectives and sociocultural contexts, were identified and recovered. Average breastfeeding duration was 2.73 months shorter than the recommended 6-month period. Deciding to breastfeed "as long as possible" and prior breastfeeding experience were associated with meeting breastfeeding expectations. Instead, maternal age, caesarean delivery, and socio-environmental factors negatively affected the breastfeeding process. Our findings highlighted intrinsic maternal motivations and the impact of healthcare professional interventions, revealing the complex interplay of psychological, social, and cultural factors in breastfeeding decisions.
Conclusion
An exhaustive typological analysis of maternal motivation throughout breastfeeding phases is feasible. Motivational dynamics may vary, concretely influencing breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. These dynamics are foreseen by maternal intent and bolstered by self-efficacy conducive to successful progression. Furthermore, sociocultural and clinical variables modulate motivational pathways. In-depth analysis allows for more effective professional interventions within the framework of humanized care and the development of innovative health plans and policies.

AB  - Objective
Programs using heroes to promote positive health and educational outcomes for children and adolescents have been increasingly implemented. However, a comprehensive review of such interventions is lacking. This scoping review maps the existing empirical literature on hero-based interventions.
Method
A systematic search of databases including CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and others (final search February 2025), covering all years up to January 2025 identified peer-reviewed studies in English on hero-based interventions targeting health or educational outcomes in children and adolescents. Exclusions included non-English papers, those lacking empirical results, focusing on adults, or classified as grey literature. Data on study characteristics were extracted and analyzed using Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework.
Results
From 134 screened articles, 39 met the inclusion criteria, identifying 11 distinct programs targeting diverse populations across regions such as the U.S., U.K., India, Turkey, and Japan. These programs, im-plemented in both educational and clinical settings, addressed physical and mental health, education, social skills, and trauma recovery. The review assessed empirical support for these programs, noting variability in evidence strength, and highlighted their adaptability across different cultural contexts.
Conclusions
Hero-based interventions show promise in supporting youth across various outcomes, though no universal approach exists. Tailoring interventions to the specific cultural and contextual needs of young people is essential. Future research should focus on refining these methods, matching heroes to participants, and independent replication.

AB  - The advent of paper-based biosensors represents a novel paradigm in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, emerging as versatile tools. However, the broad term “biosensors” can be misleading, encompassing a range of techniques such as dipstick assays, electrochemical, microfluidics and immunoassay-based biosensors (including lateral flow (LFA), vertical flow and nucleic acid-based immunoassays). This narrative review aims to consolidate the vast and dispersed information on biosensors into a systematically organized resource addressing both practical and theoretical aspects for researchers developing paper-based biosensors. It offers a comprehensive classification of biorecognition elements and labels, insights into various conjugation techniques, and characterization methods for both labels and conjugates. Following the development and optimization of biological reactions, this review emphasizes the careful selection of membranes and reagents to effectively reproduce molecular reactions on paper. Membranes are critical to biosensor efficacy, with fluid dynamics influenced by factors such as pore size, protein holding capacity and wicking rate. While POC diagnostics have traditionally provided binary (yes/no) results, advancements now allow for semi-quantitative and quantitative results. Technologies such as in-text, printers, various software’s and smartphone can be used as colour analysis utilizing colour models beyond RGB like XYZ, grey intensity, CMY, CMYK, HSV and HSL that can analyse and process the colour intensity. AI integration further simplifies result analysis through image analysis, interpretation, predictive modelling, clinical decision support, enhancing detection, data integration and management. This review also emphasizes validation and stability studies in accordance with regulatory guidelines, ensuring the reliability of biosensors. The review ultimately covers: (i) A foundational understanding of various biosensor techniques, focusing on the self-sufficient LFA technique. (ii) Strategies to enhance sensitivity through pre- and post-assay modifications. (iii) A comprehensive troubleshooting section addressing common challenges in bioassay and fabrication. (iv) Multiplexing approaches enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes for enhanced biomarker confirmation. By amalgamating knowledge from these approaches, this review offers the potential to elevate a basic traditional LFA strip into a highly sensitive diagnostic tool. It serves not only as a repository of knowledge but also as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners navigating the burgeoning field of paper-based biosensors.

AB  - Purpose
Metal laser-powder-bed-fusion using laser-beam parts are particularly susceptible to contamination due to particles attached to the surface. This may compromise so-called technical cleanliness (e.g. in NASA RPTSTD-8070, ASTM G93, ISO 14952 or ISO 16232), which is important for many 3D-printed components, such as implants or liquid rocket engines. The purpose of the presented comparative study is to show how cleanliness is improved by design and different surface treatment methods.
Design/methodology/approach
Convex and concave test parts were designed, built and surface-treated by combinations of media blasting, electroless nickel plating and electrochemical polishing. After cleaning and analysing the technical cleanliness according to ASTM and ISO standards, effects on particle contamination, appearance, mass and dimensional accuracy are presented.
Findings
Contamination reduction factors are introduced for different particle sizes and surface treatment methods. Surface treatments were more effective for concave design features, however, the initial and resulting absolute particle contamination was higher. Results further indicate that there are trade-offs between cleanliness and other objectives in design. Design guidelines are introduced to solve conflicts in design when requirements for cleanliness exist.
Originality/value
This paper recommends designing parts and corresponding process chains for manufacturing simultaneously. Incorporating post-processing characteristics into the design phase is both feasible and essential. In the experimental study, electroless nickel plating in combination with prior glass bead blasting resulted in the lowest total remaining particle contamination. This process applied for cleanliness is a novelty, as well as a comparison between the different surface treatment methods.

AB  - Background
Surgery-related adverse events are among the most common adverse events in-hospital. However, no comprehensive, multidisciplinary perioperative guidelines exist at the European level. The aim of this study is to describe the process and results in achieving European multidisciplinary consensus on perioperative patient safety recommendations.
Methods
This multimethod study included: (1) a systematic review of guidelines; (2) selection and synthesis of recommendations; and (3) a two-round modified Delphi technique including a 2-day face-to-face consensus conference. We recruited a panel of two expert groups balanced in terms of gender, geographical origin, and professional background, with meaningful participation from patient representatives. Consensus was defined as at least 70% of the panel rating a recommendation 7–9 on a 9-point Likert scale for importance to patient safety and feasibility of implementation.
Results
The systematic review included 267 guidelines, from which 4666 patient safety recommendations were identified and extracted. After four synthesis rounds, 99 recommendations were presented for the Delphi survey, detailing their strength of recommendation, level of evidence, and methodological quality of the cited guidelines. An expert group, composed of 66 multidisciplinary experts from 19 European countries, participated with a response rate of 80.3%. After the two Delphi rounds and the consensus conference, the panel agreed on a final set of 101 recommended perioperative patient safety practices.
Conclusions
A set of 101 comprehensive, evidence-based, patient-centred perioperative patient safety practices was developed through a European consensus process to improve the quality of care in healthcare facilities across Europe and beyond.

AB  - The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) significantly impedes drug delivery to the central nervous system. Nanotechnology, especially surface-functionalized lipid nanoparticles, offers innovative approaches to overcome this barrier. However, choosing an effective functionalization strategy is challenging due to the lack of detailed comparative analysis in current literature. Our systematic review examined various functionalization strategies and their impact on BBB permeability from 2041 identified articles, of which 80 were included for data extraction. Peptides were the most common modification (18) followed by mixed strategies (12) proteins (9), antibodies (7), and other strategies (8). Interestingly, 26 studies showed BBB penetration with unmodified or modified nanoparticles using commonly applied strategies such as PEGylation or surfactant addition. Statistical analysis across 42 studies showed correlation between higher in vivo permeation improvements and nanoparticle type, size, and functionalization category. The highest ratios were found for nanostructured lipid carriers or biomimetic systems, in studies with particle sizes under 150 nm, and in those applying mixed functionalization strategies. The interstudy heterogeneity we observed highlights the importance of adopting standardized evaluation protocols to enhance comparability. Our systematic review aims to provide a comparative insight and identify future research directions in the development of more effective lipid nanoparticle systems for drug delivery to the brain to help improve the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders and brain tumours.

AB  - Study objective
Despite the popularity of vaping and electronic vapor delivery systems (EVDS), the healthcare community remains largely unfamiliar with their potential to induce harm. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify how EVDS use affects the pulmonary system in order to support future anesthetic guidelines for patients who vape.
Design
Systematic Review. An electronic search of databases CINAHL and PubMed was performed in October 2020.
Study eligibility criteria
Studies were included if they were deemed original research published in English, if they were performed exclusively in humans or on human tissue, if they examined the effects of EVDS on pulmonary function or tissue, and/or if they produced quantitative data. Studies were excluded if they utilized animal samples, studied subjects under the age of 18, presented expert opinions or reviews, offered qualitative data, reported case studies, or only evaluated EVDS' efficacy as a smoking cessation tool.
Main results
This review identified six EVDS-induced pulmonary implications warranting anesthetic consideration: alterations in pulmonary function tests, disrupted ventilation, impaired mucociliary clearance, tissue destruction, a disrupted immune response, and oxidative stress with DNA fragmentation.
Conclusion
A total of 38 studies described the effects of EVDS on pulmonary function, airway epithelial tissue, and inflammatory mechanisms that may lead to chronic pulmonary disease. Anesthesia providers are encouraged to assess patients for EVDS use during the preoperative period and use the information generated by this systematic review to drive subsequent care.

AB  - With the rapid development and popularization of Internet technology, the propagation and diffusion of information become much easier and faster. While making life more convenient, the Internet also promotes the wide spread of fake news, which will have a great negative impact on countries, societies, and individuals. Therefore, a lot of research efforts have been made to combat fake news. Fake news detection is typically a classification problem aiming at verifying the veracity of news contents, which may include texts, images and videos. This article provides a comprehensive survey of fake news detection. We first summarize three intrinsic characteristics of fake news by analyzing its entire diffusion process, namely intentional creation, heteromorphic transmission, and controversial reception. The first refers to why users publish fake news, the second denotes how fake news propagates and distributes, and the last means what viewpoints different users may hold for fake news. We then discuss existing fake news detection approaches according to these characteristics. Thus, this review will enable readers to better understand this field from a new perspective. We finally discuss the trends of technological advances in this field and also outline some potential directions for future research.

AB  - Introduction
Despite the recognized importance of interprofessional collaboration (IPC) in trauma care, healthcare professionals often work in silos. Interprofessional (IP) interventions are crucial for optimizing IPC and delivering high-quality care across clinical contexts, yet their effectiveness throughout the inpatient trauma care continuum is not well understood. Thus, this review aimed to examine the literature on the effectiveness of IP interventions on collaboration processes and related outcomes in inpatient trauma care.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology. We searched six databases for studies from the last decade on IP interventions in inpatient trauma care. Two independent reviewers categorized IP interventions (education, practice, organization) and extracted their impact on IPC processes and related outcomes (team performance, patient, organization).
Results
Of the 17,397 studies screened, 148 met the inclusion criteria. Most were cohort designs (72%), conducted in level I trauma centers (57%) and emergency departments (51%), and involved surgeons (56%) and nurses (53%). Studies focused on IP organization interventions (51%), such as clinical pathways; IP practice interventions (35%), such as trauma team activation protocols; and IP education interventions (14%) including multi-method education. IP practice interventions most effectively improved team performance results, while IP education interventions primarily improved IPC processes. Positive patient outcomes were limited, with few studies examining organizational effects.
Conclusions
Significant advancements are still required in IP interventions and trauma care research. Future studies should rigorously explore the effectiveness of interventions throughout the inpatient trauma care continuum and focus on developing robust measures for patient and organizational outcomes.

AB  - Ensuring an inclusive and just transition towards a low-carbon economy has become increasingly important. This paper emphasises the challenges in increasing the extent of women's participation in the energy transition in ASEAN and G7 countries. In this paper, two research questions are addressed: First, what are the challenges and barriers women face in ASEAN and G7 countries in participating in the energy transition? Second, what are the policies that can be implemented in ASEAN and G7 countries to ensure that the energy transition is both just and inclusive? Using VOSviewer, we found a gap in the literature, particularly in terms of women's perspectives in the context of the energy transition in ASEAN and G7 countries. To bridge this gap, we collected data by conducting interviews with women working in the energy sector in ASEAN and G7 countries. Moreover, we employed scientific literature to strengthen the analysis. These data were qualitatively analysed by applying Jenkins' three tenets of justice in the energy transition. The challenges we identified refer to raising awareness, access to opportunities, cultural background, women's psychological beliefs and physical considerations. Our discussion extends to policy implications, including drivers to policy change, enabling policies and the role of the private sector, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academia and communities in increasing women's participation in the energy transition.

AB  - The global plastic waste crisis underscores the urgent need for sustainable recycling, with chemical depolymerisation emerging as a cornerstone of the circular economy. This study maps global research trends and strategic pathways for waste plastic depolymerisation, revealing exponential growth since 2016, dominated by China and the U.S., with Europe leading in citation impact. Research has focused on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) via glycolysis, hydrolysis, and enzymatic methods; however, it neglects polyolefins, which are dominant in waste streams, exposing a critical mismatch. Emerging hybrid technologies, such as microwave-assisted and enzymatic-catalytic approaches, show promise but struggle with scalability and cost. Sustainability is gaining attention; however, weak Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) frameworks impede progress. Three main research domains have emerged, namely fundamental mechanisms, polymer-specific solutions, and sustainable innovation. Strategic directions include shifting the focus to polyolefins, integrating hybrid methods, and embedding LCA/TEA standards supported by policies such as polyolefin recycling subsidies and UN Treaty-backed collaborations. These insights offer researchers, funders, and policymakers a roadmap to align depolymerisation research with circular economy goals, advancing scalable and equitable solutions to the challenge of plastic waste.

AB  - This study presents the first detailed dendrochronological research of old trees in Olexandria park, a historical landscape garden established by the Branicki family in the late 18th century in Ukraine. By analyzing tree-ring data from the oldest trees in the park, we aimed to refine our understanding of its developmental stages and verify long-held historical narratives. Our results reveal that native species, Quercus robur and Pinus sylvestris, are the oldest tree specimens in the park, with the piths dating back to the late 18th century respectively. This suggests that the initial stage (1787–1791) of park development may have begun earlier than previously thought or that existing old-growth forest trees were integrated into the park's design. Additionally, the age of the oldest non-native species indicates they were planted during the third stage of development (1815–1865), with further plantings occurring during the fourth stage (1865–1918). Our study supports the idea that this historical park has been continuously modified and developed throughout its history from the late 18th to early 20th century. Contrary to some long-held narratives, most of the studied trees are not gifts from Catherine II or Grigory Potemkin, nor were they planted by the Romanov family; rather, some are older than previously expected.

AB  - Agent-based models (ABMs) offer promise for realistically simulating human behaviours and interactions during emergency evacuations. This review aims to systematically assess the state of the art in ABM-based evacuation modelling with respect to methodologies, validation practices, and the associated challenges over the past decade. The review critically examines 134 studies from 2013 to 2023 that have applied ABMs for pedestrian evacuation simulation to synthesise current capabilities, limitations, and advancement pathways. Findings identify persistent challenges related to modeller bias, computational complexity, data scarcity for calibration and validation, and the predominance of simplistic rule-based decision-making models, while promise exists with the adoption of flexible behavioural frameworks, high-performance computing architectures, machine learning techniques for adaptive agent behaviours and surrogate modelling, and evolutionary computation methods for transparent rule generation. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among behavioural scientists, modellers, and emergency planners to enhance the realism and reliability of ABMs. By providing a critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art and proposing future research directions, this review aims to accelerate the development and application of ABMs that can meaningfully enhance the safety and resilience of communities facing emergencies.

The students’ academic performance is influenced by a complex interplay among several factors. Traditional educational approaches often struggle to accommodate the diverse needs of students, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes.
Purpose
This article aims to comprehensively understand the role of study strategies and learning disabilities in shaping academic performance. Through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the purpose is to propose a decision support system (DSS) for recommendations to improve the educational approach.
Method
To identify features with higher explanatory power based on empirical data, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognize patterns of association between study strategies, learning disabilities, and academic performance. Using the pondered features, a Fuzzy-based AI was built for offering recommendations into effective educational interventions.
Conclusions
The findings underscore the significance of study strategies in mitigating the negative impact of learning disabilities on academic performance. By leveraging the proposed AI tools framework, educators can make informed decisions to tailor educational approaches, catering to the unique cognitive profiles of students. Personalized interventions based on identified patterns can lead to improved academic outcomes and greater inclusivity in the learning environment.
Practical implications
Educators and policymakers can adopt the proposed data-driven strategies to enhance teaching methodologies, thereby accommodating the varying needs of students with learning disabilities. This approach fosters a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape, promoting academic success for all learners.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence and intelligent technologies, machines have evolved beyond mere mechanical tools and now possess human-like capabilities, including sensing and decision-making. This has led to the emergence of Collaboration in Human-Machine Intelligence (CHMI) as machine intelligence becomes more integrated into collaborative work, with trust serving as the foundational mechanism. By comprehending the concept of trust and its influencing factors, machines have the potential to adapt to human trust states, thereby enhancing the overall CHMI experience. A prerequisite for achieving this is the precise real-time measurement of trust. Neuroimaging technologies, as means to measure neurophysiological responses, have shown the potential to map brain functions and cognitive processes involving trust directly. However, methodological and context variations have led to dispersed neurophysiological evidence related to trust. Therefore, this paper comprehensively summarizes neuroimaging-based trust measurement in CHMI, employing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) as representative neuroimaging tools. A systematic literature review was conducted on Scopus and the Web of Science, and 56 relevant articles were identified. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of these articles revealed a diverse range of neuroimaging tools being used in different CHMI contexts. The neurophysiological-trust relationship has been studied using various methodological perspectives, including time–frequency analysis, event-related potential (ERP), and connectivity analysis. These investigations have identified multiple brain features associated with trust, some of which demonstrate consistency while others show inconsistency. These findings suggest a lack of coherence in trust-related neurophysiological features. Accordingly, three main limitations are identified: a lack of standard methodologies, insufficient focus on connectivity analysis, and a dearth of multimodal and machine learning analysis. Five future directions are proposed to address these limitations and facilitate real-time trust estimation using neuroimaging tools. These directions aim to overcome the identified limitations and pave the way for developing trustworthy CHMI systems. The practical implications of this study lie in informing the design and implementation of such systems, ultimately leading to improved team performance and the establishment of more efficient and reliable collaborative systems.

AB  - This paper addresses the critical need to incorporate Circular Economy principles into supply chain management for decoupling economic growth and resource consumption. Circular supply chains, characterized by their restorative and regenerative nature, inherently introduce operational complexities. Concurrently, hyperconnectivity is evolving as a pervasive reality, defined by the extensive and intricate interconnectedness among actors across multiple layers. Specifically, we investigate the potential of the Physical Internet, a hyperconnected global logistics system, to facilitate the implementation of circular supply chains. Our approach includes a systematic literature review to map the current landscape and the development of a novel conceptual framework. This framework, merging the Physical Internet and circular supply chain concepts, identifies ten interrelated characteristics from various aspects such as product design, production, logistics, supply chain asset utilization, product usage, recovery, performance monitoring, material and energy exchange, as well as technology and business model innovation. Additionally, we introduce a four-stage maturity model to evaluate and improve companies' circular supply chain practices systematically. Its practical application is illustrated through two cases in automobile and sport garment industry respectively. This study is among the first to explore the integration of hyperconnectivity in logistics management into implementing circular supply chains. It lays a theoretical foundation and suggests actionable strategies.

AB  - As Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows are becoming very relevant for the different stages of the project’s lifecycle, more data is produced and managed across it. The information and data accumulated in BIM-based projects present an opportunity for analysis and extraction of project knowledge from the inception to the operation phase. In other industries, Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach to automate processes and extract useful insights from different types and sources of data. The rapid development of ML applications, the growing generation of BIM-related data in projects, and the different needs for use of this data present serious challenges to adopt and effectively apply ML techniques to BIM-based projects in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry. While research on the use of BIM data through ML has increased in the past decade, it is still in a nascent stage. In order to asses where the industry stands today, this paper carries out a systematic literature review (SLR) identifying and summarizing common emerging areas of application and utilization of ML within the context of BIM-generated data. Moreover, the paper identifies research gaps and trends. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research directions are suggested, focusing on information architecture and data, applications scalability, and human information interactions.

AB  - Background
Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite that can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals. It is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, a significant public health issue worldwide. Mathematical models are useful to study the transmission dynamics of T. gondii infection in different settings, and may be used to compare the effectiveness of prevention measures.
Methods
To obtain an overview of existing mathematical models for transmission of T. gondii, a systematic review was undertaken. The review was conducted according to an a priori protocol and the results were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Specific search terms were developed and used in the search of three databases (Scopus, PubMed, and Embase).
Results
In total, 484 unique records were retrieved from the systematic search. Among them, 15 studies that used mathematical models to study the transmission of T. gondii. These studies were categorized into four groups based on the primary aims: dynamics of transmission (n=8), intervention (n=5), spatial distribution (n=1), and outbreak investigation (n=1).
Conclusions
Considering the high disease burden caused by T. gondii, the number of studies using mathematical models to understand the transmission dynamics of this parasite and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention measures was only 15. This systematic review provides an overview of existing mathematical models and identifies the data gaps for model building. The results from this study can be helpful for further development of mathematical models and improved understanding of the transmission dynamics of T. gondii infection.

AB  - Accurate knowledge of thermal properties is essential for evaluating the performance, reliability, and efficiency of materials across scientific and engineering disciplines. Estimation of thermal properties remains a critical aspect of material characterization, driving advancements in measurement techniques. Among these, Active Infrared Thermography (AIRT) has emerged as a powerful non-contact approach for assessing key thermal parameters such as thermal diffusivity, conductivity, effusivity, and volumetric heat capacity. AIRT analyzes spatio-temporal temperature evolution of a material’s surface under controlled thermal excitation, enabling precise property estimation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of three primary AIRT methods—Pulse Thermography, Step-Heating Thermography, and Lock-in Thermography—highlighting their principles, advantages, and limitations when applied to opaque, semi-transparent, and multi-layered materials. Additionally, it explores recent advancements, including automation, machine learning integration, and hybrid thermographic approaches, which enhance accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency. The paper explores challenges in thermal property estimation for complex materials and evaluates emerging methods like inverse problem-solving and finite element modeling. As AIRT evolves with AI-driven analysis and advanced modeling, its role in non-destructive material evaluation and industry expands. This review aims to guide researchers in selecting optimal methodologies while outlining future research directions to further enhance AIRT’s capabilities in thermal characterization and material science.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the quality and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-based radiomics for predicting Ki-67 expression in breast cancer.
Materials and Methods
A systematic literature search was performed to find relevant studies published in different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase up until March 10, 2023. All papers were independently evaluated for eligibility by two reviewers. Studies that matched research questions and provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. The quality of the articles was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools. The predictive value of MRI-based radiomics for Ki-67 antigen in patients with breast cancer was assessed using pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Meta-regression was performed to explore the cause of heterogeneity. Different covariates were used for subgroup analysis.
Results
31 studies were included in the systematic review; among them, 21 reported sufficient data for meta-analysis. 20 training cohorts and five validation cohorts were pooled separately. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of MRI-based radiomics for predicting Ki-67 expression in training cohorts were 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73–0.86], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78–0.86], and 0.88 [95%CI, 0.85–0.91], respectively. The corresponding values for validation cohorts were 0.81 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62–0.82], and 0.84 [95%CI, 0.80–0.87], respectively. Based on QUADAS-2, some risks of bias were detected for reference standard and flow and timing domains. However, the quality of the included article was acceptable. The mean RQS score of the included articles was close to 6, corresponding to 16.6% of the maximum possible score. Significant heterogeneity was observed in pooled sensitivity and specificity of training cohorts (I2 > 75%). We found that using deep learning radiomic methods, magnetic field strength (3 T vs. 1.5 T), scanner manufacturer, region of interest structure (2D vs. 3D), route of tissue sampling, Ki-67 cut-off, logistic regression for model construction, and LASSO for feature reduction as well as PyRadiomics software for feature extraction had a great impact on heterogeneity according to our joint model analysis. Diagnostic performance in studies that used deep learning-based radiomics and multiple MRI sequences (e.g., DWI+DCE) was slightly higher. In addition, radiomic features derived from DWI sequences performed better than contrast-enhanced sequences in terms of specificity and sensitivity. No publication bias was found based on Deeks' funnel plot. Sensitivity analysis showed that eliminating every study one by one does not impact overall results.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis showed that MRI-based radiomics has a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating breast cancer patients with high Ki-67 expression from low-expressing groups. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods still do not surpass 90%, restricting them from being used as a supplement to current pathological assessments (e.g., biopsy or surgery) to predict Ki-67 expression accurately.

AB  - Substance Use Disorder (SUD) remains a significant global challenge, with current treatment options offering limited efficacy. Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), especially those with additional mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonistic activity, have shown promise in addressing SUD. In this study, a series of meta-substituted N-cyclopropylmethyl-nornepenthone derivatives were designed and synthesized, and their biological activities were assessed, leading to the identification of a KOR/MOR dual modulator, compound 10a. Unlike its para-positional isomer SLL-1062, where KOR activity is completely abolished, compound 10a displayed a single-digit nanomolar affinity for KOR, while its binding profiles for MOR and delta opioid receptor (DOR) were comparable to those of SLL-1062. Functional assays in vitro confirmed that compound 10a exhibited agonistic activity at KOR and antagonistic activity at MOR. The molecular basis for the introduction of a KOR component into compound 10a was further elucidated. Although compound 10a did not produce apparent antinociception in vivo, it effectively blocked morphine-induced antinociception and intestinal motility inhibition in rodent models. This study provides valuable insights into the development of MOR/KOR dual modulators and presents new lead compounds for potential treatments for SUD.

AB  - Objective
To outline the effect of a Le Fort 1-type advancement osteotomy or Le Fort 1 level distraction osteogenesis (DO) procedure with anterior repositioning on speech, respiration and dimensions of the pharyngeal airway in patients with cleft lip and/or palate.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). For studies published until October 2023, an electronic search was conducted, and those were included in which the impact of Le Fort 1 maxillary advancement (I) on the speech, breathing, and pharyngeal airway dimensions (O) compared to pre-operative situation (C) in the patients with non -syndromic cleft lip/palate (P) were assessed. A meta-analysis was done to assess the difference in the amount of pharyngeal depth.
Results
From 892 studies, 19 studies were included in the analysis. All studies reported an increase of airway dimensions that were evaluated with 3D-imaging, velar length and improvement in breathing after the intervention. Meta-analysis of the six studies revealed the significant increase of the following variables: nasopharyngeal depth (NPD) immediately after the Le Fort 1 osteotomy, NPD and middle pharyngeal depth immediately and 12 months after Le Fort 1 DO.
Conclusion
In patients with cleft lip and/or palate, maxillary advancement using Le Fort 1 osteotomy and Le Fort 1 DO can significantly increase the dimensions of the airway in the nasopharynx. However, the changes in speech and breathing parameters were not significant in the scrutinized literature. Impact of Le Fort maxillary advancement on patients’ speech remains controversial.

AB  - Background
The rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide and the high recent mortality rates (74.4%) associated with them, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is causing a substantial global burden of disease, necessitating innovative and sustainable long-term care solutions.
Objective
This scoping review aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)–based conversational agents (CAs)—including chatbots, voicebots, and anthropomorphic digital avatars—as human-like health caregivers in the remote management of NCDs as well as identify critical areas for future research and provide insights into how these technologies might be used effectively in health care to personalize NCD management strategies.
Methods
A broad literature search was conducted in July 2023 in 6 electronic databases—Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science—using the search terms “conversational agents,” “artificial intelligence,” and “noncommunicable diseases,” including their associated synonyms. We also manually searched gray literature using sources such as ProQuest Central, ResearchGate, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. We included empirical studies published in English from January 2010 to July 2023 focusing solely on health care–oriented applications of CAs used for remote management of NCDs. The narrative synthesis approach was used to collate and summarize the relevant information extracted from the included studies.
Results
The literature search yielded a total of 43 studies that matched the inclusion criteria. Our review unveiled four significant findings: (1) higher user acceptance and compliance with anthropomorphic and avatar-based CAs for remote care; (2) an existing gap in the development of personalized, empathetic, and contextually aware CAs for effective emotional and social interaction with users, along with limited consideration of ethical concerns such as data privacy and patient safety; (3) inadequate evidence of the efficacy of CAs in NCD self-management despite a moderate to high level of optimism among health care professionals regarding CAs’ potential in remote health care; and (4) CAs primarily being used for supporting nonpharmacological interventions such as behavioral or lifestyle modifications and patient education for the self-management of NCDs.
Conclusions
This review makes a unique contribution to the field by not only providing a quantifiable impact analysis but also identifying the areas requiring imminent scholarly attention for the ethical, empathetic, and efficacious implementation of AI in NCD care. This serves as an academic cornerstone for future research in AI-assisted health care for NCD management.

AB  - Brain plasticity and cognitive functions are tightly influenced by foods or nutrients, which determine a metabolic modulation having a long-term effect on health, involving also epigenetic mechanisms. Breast milk or formula based on cow milk is the first food for human beings, who, throughout their lives, are then exposed to different types of milk. We previously demonstrated that rats fed with milk derived from distinct species, with different compositions and nutritional properties, display selective modulation of systemic metabolic and inflammatory profiles through changes of mitochondrial functions and redox state in liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle. Here, in a rat model, we demonstrated that isoenergetic supplementation of milk from cow (CM), donkey (DM) or human (HM) impacts mitochondrial functions and redox state in the brain cortex and cortical synapses, affecting neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, we found that the administration of different milk modulates DNA methylation in rat brain cortex and consequently affects gene expression. Our results emphasize the importance of nutrition in brain and synapse physiology, and highlight the key role played in this context by mitochondria, nutrient-sensitive organelles able to orchestrate metabolic and inflammatory responses.

AB  - Social media platforms have evolved into an online representation of our social interactions. We may use the resources they provide to analyze phenomena that occur within them, such as the development and viralization of offensive and hostile content. In today’s polarized world, the escalating nature of this behavior is cause for concern in modern society. This research includes an in-depth examination of previous efforts and strategies for detecting and preventing hateful content on the social network Twitter, as well as a novel classification approach based on users’ profiles, related social environment and generated tweets. This paper’s contribution is threefold: (i) an improvement in the performance of the HaterNet algorithm, an expert system developed in collaboration with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security (Ministry of the Interior) that is capable of identifying and monitoring the evolution of hate speech on Twitter using an LTSM + MLP neural network architecture. To that end, a model based on BERT, HaterBERT, has been created and tested using HaterNet’s public dataset, providing results that show a significant improvement; (ii) A methodology to create a user database in the form of a relational network to infer textual and centrality features. This contribution, SocialGraph, has been independently tested with various traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, demonstrating its usefulness in spotting haters; (iii) a final model, SocialHaterBERT, that integrates the previous two approaches by analyzing features other than those inherent in the text. Experiment results reveal that this last contribution greatly improves outcomes, establishing a new field of study that transcends textual boundaries, paving the way for future research in coupled models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.

Based on 144 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database, the study adopts numerical and visualization techniques using the Vosviewer and Biblioshiny R-package to examine the extant literature from 2011 to 2023. The outcomes of the scientific bibliographic coupling identified three dominant themes: Theme 1, ‘Board Gender Diversity and Sustainability Reporting’; Theme 2, ‘Importance of Governance Structures in shaping reporting practices’ and Theme 3, ‘Factors Shaping Integrated Reporting’. The review concludes that board diversity supports environmental, social, and governance reporting and proves integral to sustainable corporate practices and context-specific strategies. Policymakers should design inclusive governance frameworks by recognizing the role of board diversity in enhancing ESG reporting quality, leading to regulatory reforms that encourage greater gender diversity and transparency in sustainability practices. As for businesses, having diverse boards enhances decision-making and innovation, improving ESG reporting quality and fostering better sustainability outcomes. Finally, for academia, the research provides a foundation for future studies on the intersection of board diversity and ESG reporting, particularly in exploring cultural and regional variations, as well as the role of technology in improving disclosure quality. Thus, this study is expected to have far-reaching implications for policymaking, business strategies, societal decisions, and academic research, which could eventually contribute to quality sustainability reporting and business sustainability.

AB  - Concrete production is a significant contributor to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to its extensive use. These notable impacts have driven a desire to quantify the environmental burdens and pathways to reduce burdens of this product, commonly through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Here, we review the application of the LCA methodology in assessing various decarbonization strategies and areas where accuracy of quantitative environmental impact assessments for comparison can be improved. Key findings suggest a need for improved standardization in selection of processes included in a system boundary, choice of a functional unit that considers both mechanical performance and long-term sustainability, guidance on impact allocation, and consideration of benefits across the entire product life cycle. Additionally, the establishment of standard practices for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses through a stochastic approach is recommended. Findings identify gaps that need to be addressed to enable LCA research's potential efficacy on industry decarbonization, and can guide the development of standard practices, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and effective assessment of decarbonization strategies in the cement and concrete industry.

AB  - Quantifying the economic cost of long-duration power outages is crucial to justifying investments in resiliency and reliability improvements. However, extensive study on the subject complicates the identification of power outage costs and determining the most suitable approach to quantify them for an individual, specific facility, particularly in the context of extreme events. This research provides a systematic review of economic studies estimating the impact of environmental disasters at the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. Of 326 articles, evaluating the costs of power outages in extreme events, this work identified 22 studies that attempted to quantify the economic costs. These findings indicate that quantifying power outage costs lacks standardization, posing challenges for comparing different studies. Most analyses aiming to quantify these costs for utilities, sectors, and the overall economy rely on outdated survey data, which offer generalized rather than specific cost estimations. The costs of power outages exhibit a significant dependence on factors such as the sector involved, the type of customer affected, and the outage duration. To quantify industry costs, the research in this study suggests that using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's online, open-access Customer Damage Function Calculator is the best option for individual-level assessments of industries, hospitals, offices, education centers, and similar facilities. However, the Interruption Cost Estimate Calculator can estimate outage costs across industrial, commercial, and residential sectors for macroeconomic outcomes. Finally, this article discusses the relative strengths of these methods and tools and the potential directions for future research.

AB  - In the past decade, polymeric film-based colorimetric chemosensors have emerged as a promising technology for ion detection. This review examines the literature on these chemosensors, providing an overview of their preparation methods, their properties, tools for quantifying colorimetric signals (including naked-eye detection and colorimetry using colorimeters, digital image processing, or UV–Vis spectroscopy), and their analytical performance. Most of the evaluated works focused on the determination of metal ions, highlighting the need for research targeting other types of ions. Although UV–Vis spectroscopy was employed in almost 50% of the studies, digital image colorimetry is emerging as a simpler and more cost-effective alternative for quantifying colorimetric signals of the chemosensors. The analysis of the published works enabled the identification of key advances, existing gaps, and potential future directions for enhancing the performance of these chemosensors and broadening their range of applications, particularly in the detection of environmentally and industrially relevant analytes.

AB  - Interactions between the scientific community and policymakers have substantially increased over the past two decades, reflecting a collective effort to craft evidence-based policies and foster policy-relevant scientific research. This evolving relationship has given rise to a growing body of academic research aimed at analyzing the characteristics of, or the challenges related to, such interactions often grouped under the concept of ‘Science-Policy Interface’. Recent studies have initiated endeavours to consolidate this still fragmented field through global reviews, but such attempts remain scarce, which limits our understanding of this rich and complex concept. This article aims to contribute to this integrating effort by applying a text mining approach based on a latent Dirichlet allocation model on 1048 Scopus-indexed abstracts published from 1964 to 2023. This analysis uncovers 60 distinct latent topics, which are then synthesised into 15 meta-themes using hierarchical clustering. Five of these dominant themes relate to specific challenges inherent to the nature and the dynamics of the knowledge interaction process and its organization within the Science-Policy Interfaces, while the remaining themes pertain to specific issues that are addressed by these interfaces. Persistent gaps in this literature regarding the concepts of trust, power, and the issue of energy are identified. By discussing the interconnectedness of the clusters in relationship with previous reviews, this study not only provides a comprehensive thematic review of the Science-Policy Interfaces field but also identifies pivotal research directions and offers a structured synthesis that can guide future evidence-based policy research and practice.

We show that neither full cooperation amongst players nor full information from a centralized controller is ever necessary to do so.

AB  - Objective
This study aimed to assess the effects of exercise interventions of more than 8 weeks on thyroid function in adults with hypothyroidism through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Materials and methods
The PEDro, WOS, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles, which then underwent standardised screening, data extraction, and bias risk assessment. A total of seven randomised controlled trials (n = 7) were included, predominantly examining 12 weeks of exercise therapy. A meta-analysis was conducted using data extracted from the included studies. Standardised mean differences were calculated for thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.
Results
Statistically significant reductions in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (SMD: −3.254; 95 % CI: −3.937 to −2.572; p < 0.001) and increases in thyroxine (T4) level (SMD: 1.315; 95 % CI: 0.263–2.367; p = 0.015) were noted in exercise intervention groups as compared to control groups. Heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 65.93 %, p = 0.019) and no publication bias was detected. In addition, based on GRADE assessment, the certainty of evidence was rated as moderate for the TSH outcome and very low for the T4 outcome.
Conclusion
Findings from seven randomised controlled trials support the integration of long-term exercise as a non-pharmacological adjunct in the management of hypothyroidism. Exercise interventions, alongside conventional treatment, appear to improve thyroid function by reducing TSH and increasing T4 levels.

AB  - The effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) diameter on the structural evolution and mechanical properties of vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) arrays under ultra-high strain rate shock compression remains an open question. To address this, molecular dynamics simulations using the Hugoniostat method were conducted on VACNT arrays consisting of CNTs with varying diameters and a fixed length of 10 nm. The findings indicate that for VACNT arrays with thinner CNTs, the dominant buckling mode follows an Euler beam-like pattern, where the critical buckling limit increases with CNT diameter. Conversely, for VACNT arrays with larger CNTs, a shell-like buckling mode is activated, leading to a decrease in the buckling critical limit as CNT diameter increases.Further analysis of atomistic evolution under high-strain-rate compression shows that larger CNT arrays undergo a partial phase transition (PPT) from sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms at higher strains (greater densification). However, these arrays exhibit a lower sp3 fraction after PPT. Mechanical testing reveals that although VACNT arrays with larger CNTs have lower ultimate compressive strength post-PPT, they experience a greater reinforcement effect. These insights into the interplay between buckling regimes and phase transition behavior enhance our understanding of VACNT arrays under extreme conditions, offering potential applications in strain sensors, flexible electronics, and energy storage devices.

AB  - Methane cracking (MC) is emerging as a low-carbon hydrogen production technology. This review conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 46 studies examining the sustainability of MC process. The review employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Cost (LCC), Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA), and Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) methodologies. The findings reveal that LCOH for MC technologies ranges from 0.9 to 6.6 $/kg H2, at the same time, GHG emissions span 0.8–14.5 kg CO2eq/kg H2, depending on the specific reactor configurations, plant geographical locations, and carbon revenues. These results indicate that MC can be competitive with steam methane reforming with carbon capture and electrolysis under certain conditions. However, the review identifies significant research gaps, including limited comprehensive LCA studies, a lack of social impact assessments, insufficient environmental impact analysis of molten media catalysts and particulate matter formation in MC processes, as well as insufficient analysis of the potential of biomethane cracking.

This topic holds particular relevance in the Cosmetic Industry. However, cosmetics companies, especially Small and Medium Enterprises, encounter challenges in effectively implementing digital technologies. This results in a substantial gap between the theoretical potential of the Twin Transition and the practical implementations. To fill the gap, a key role might be played by assessment and roadmapping tools that provide companies with the help and support they need. In this contribution a novel assessment and roadmapping tool is proposed. The employed methodology combines a systematic literature review with Action research approach. The proposed tool is called the Twin Transition Cosmetic Roadmapping Tool. It supports enterprises in the assessment of their current level of Twin Transition based on which a roadmap for improvement is framed. It is the first Twin Transition roadmapping tool specific for cosmetics industry. Furthermore, it encompasses all the mechanisms by which Twin Transition can be achieved throughout the entire product life cycle. The paper concludes with an application of the tool in an industrial case study, presenting and discussing the results.

A first exploration of the impact of blockchain on real estate in the Netherlands took place in 2017. In the follow-up, several blockchain and real estate studies have appeared with research on real estate and blockchain worldwide. In view of the previous research, the question remained as to what is now happening worldwide in the field of blockchain and real estate. This has resulted in the start-up of the Foundation for International Blockchain and Real Estate Expertise (FIBREE) network. This network has led to the launch of two investigations: Industry Report Blockchain Real Estate 2019 on exploration of international products and a database exploring blockchain and real estate on exploring (inter)national research. This paper aims to provides an overview and analysis of all relevant scientific publications – targeted on the Netherlands – and does so within a context of a first small international exploration of international research, experts and products – in particular land registration.
Design/methodology/approach
I have asked everybody at the Regionals Chairs of FIBREE to collect data with info about which blockchain and real estate product-suppliers or initiatives do you see, which research-output on blockchain and real estate is there and who are the experts with which specific expertise? This paper provides an overview and analysis of all relevant scientific publications – targeted on the Netherlands – and does so within a context of a first small international exploration of international research, experts and products – in particular land registration.

Research limitations/implications
A question that remains is to continue to look at existing markets or too disruptive innovation newcomers in the blockchain market. The question is whether blockchain is only a technological disruption or a real game changer and whether the entire value chain of the market is going to embrace this. Confidence in blockchain is therefore a precondition for guiding that disruption where (new) companies use new technology to offer cheaper and superior alternatives in the market. But the big question is how quickly blockchain will develop as well as all its applications.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a part of people's lives and is progressively revolutionizing our lives and businesses. From a Digital Forensics (DF) point of view, this connection turns an IoT environment into a valuable source of evidence containing diverse artifacts that could significantly aid DF investigations. Therefore, DF must adapt to the characteristics of IoT Forensics (IoTF). With the increasing deployment of IoT, organizations are compelled to revise their approaches to planning, developing, and implementing Information Technology (IT) security strategies. The IoT presents new business opportunities but also simultaneously creates various challenges related to cyber-attacks and their resolution. For optimal preparedness in the face of future incidents, companies should consider implementing Forensics Readiness (FR). This paper thus examines the factors that influence IoT-FR within organizations. By systematically analyzing research efforts from 2010 to 2023, we identified the following factors influencing IoT-FR: (1) Legal Aspect, (2) Standardization Approach, (3) Technological Resource and Technique, (4) Management Process and (5) Human Factor. Furthermore, these influencing factors are not only considered individually but also in terms of the dependencies between them. This results in the creation of a holistic model including the interdependencies and influences of the factors to provide a novel overview and enhance the integrated perspective on IoT-FR. The knowledge of factors influencing the integration of IoT-FR into organizations is valuable. It thus can be of enormous importance, as it can save time and money in the event of a subsequent incident. Additionally, alongside these factors, various challenges, techniques, models, and frameworks are highlighted to offer profound insights into the relatively novel subject of IoT-FR and to inspire future research.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in the flower industry focusing on the export business. The flower export sector is a very important industry for developing countries with considerable potential for improvement with Industry 4.0 technologies. Despite this potential, the deployment of these technologies encounters numerous barriers especially in emerging countries. This paper also studies the influence of these technologies on the productivity and sustainability of flower farms, including the entire process from planting to post-harvest management and distribution. We use a mixed-method strategy to accomplish these objectives: we performed a systematic literature review and carried out exploratory surveys administered to flower farmers in Ecuador and Colombia. The findings indicate that while the application of smart agricultural technologies in floriculture is currently restricted in emerging countries, there exists potential for its implementation. This research also points out obstacles for their adoption, including expenses, technical difficulties, and insufficient specialist. This research discusses the opportunities and problems associated with the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in floriculture by offering both theoretical and practical insights, while also giving recommendations for industry stakeholders in managing this transition.

AB  - Introduction
Nigeria, with its diverse population and rich cultural heritage, presents a unique landscape for healthcare. Traditional medicine (TM) plays a significant role, particularly in rural areas with limited access to modern healthcare. This systematic mixed-methods review examines how socioeconomic and cultural factors influence the use of TM in Nigeria, addressing gaps in understanding how these factors affect healthcare choices and integration with modern systems.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and African Journals Online (AJOL), covering studies from January 2013 to the present. Keywords included "herbal medicine," "traditional medicine," "socioeconomic factors," and "Nigeria." Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed studies in English addressing socioeconomic and cultural factors in Nigeria. Quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool. Data were extracted and synthesized through narrative synthesis and thematic analysis. The protocol for this systematic mixed-methods review was registered under the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with number - CRD42024585769.
Results
Of 4,701 records, 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Socioeconomic factors like income and education significantly influenced TM use, with affordability driving preference among lower-income groups. Cultural factors, including traditional beliefs and social norms, also played a crucial role. Findings suggest that gaps in formal healthcare and cultural adherence contribute to the continued use of TM remedies.
Conclusion

AB  - Technology-related political risks (TPR) present unique challenges for firms’ innovativeness. However, understanding how firms can manage these impacts remains limited. Grounded in real options theory and managerial risk aversion, this study explores how related and unrelated diversification strategies, combined with board technology competency (BTC), moderate TPR’s impact on firm innovativeness. Analyzing 4,171 firm-year observations from 2012 to 2020, we find that related diversification does not change the negative effect of TPR on firm innovativeness, while unrelated diversification amplifies TPR’s negative impact on firm innovativeness. BTC plays a pivotal dual role: as a substitute, it compensates for the synergies that related diversification would typically provide, enabling proactive TPR management within core industries; as a complement, it supports unrelated diversification by enhancing adaptive technology-related risk management across diverse areas. These findings underscore the importance of board expertise in fostering resilience and innovation under political uncertainty, advancing adaptive governance as a strategic necessity.

AB  - Purpose
This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the literature on sustainable entrepreneurial orientation (SEO) to identify the factors influencing its adoption by entrepreneurs and organisations. Given the documented impact of this capability and its components on performance, this study aims to contribute to existing knowledge regarding antecedents.
Design/methodology/approach
The literature review includes 23 papers published in Scopus and Web of Science indexed journals between 2017 and 2023. These studies provide an overview of the evolving understanding of SEO from its conceptualisation in 2017 to the present. Using thematic analysis, this review focuses on the factors that influence entrepreneurs’ and organisations’ adoption of SEO.
Findings
The results show that the adoption of SEO is influenced by complex and multi-causal factors. Based on a literature review, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that elucidates the drivers that contribute to sustainable practices through this capability. These drivers are categorised as (a) individual or personal, (b) organisational, or (c) contextual. Furthermore, the findings provide evidence that the emergence of SEO in organisations is not solely due to entrepreneurial aspects or organisational and contextual drivers. The literature identifies specific and interrelated drivers related to all three levels of action. In particular, decision-makers are found to cultivate specific characteristics and traits.
Originality/value
This study provides value to both researchers and policymakers in the areas of sustainable development and entrepreneurship by presenting the antecedents of SEO in a systematic and structured manner. In addition, it comprehensively identifies the gaps in previous research and provides avenues for future research.

AB  - Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Attention mechanisms that distinguish important parts from irrelevant parts have been widely used in medical image segmentation tasks. This paper systematically reviews the basic principles of attention mechanisms and their applications in medical image segmentation. First, we review the basic concepts of attention mechanism and formulation. Second, we surveyed about 200 articles related to medical image segmentation, and divided them into three groups based on their attention mechanisms, Pre-Transformer attention, Transformer attention and Mamba-related attention. In each group, we deeply analyze the attention mechanisms from three aspects based on the current literature work, i.e., the principle of the mechanism (what to use), implementation methods (how to use), and application tasks (where to use). We also thoroughly analyzed the advantages and limitations of their applications to different tasks. Finally, we summarize the current state of research and shortcomings in the field, and discuss the potential challenges in the future, including task specificity, robustness, standard evaluation, etc. We hope that this review can showcase the overall research context of traditional, Transformer and Mamba attention methods, provide a clear reference for subsequent research, and inspire more advanced attention research, not only in medical image segmentation, but also in other image analysis scenarios. Finally, we maintain the paper list and open-source code at here.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
MAP4K1 encodes Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase 1 (HPK1), a serine/threonine kinase that negatively regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling via phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins SLP-76 and Gads. While common MAP4K1 variants have been implicated in polygenic immune-mediated diseases, the impact of rare germline variants on human immunity remains undefined.
Objective
To investigate the immunological and functional consequences of HPK1 deficiency in individuals with suspected Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI).
Methods
We performed genomic linkage analysis and exome sequencing to identify disease-associated variants in IEI patients. Immunophenotyping, RNA-sequencing and functional assays were conducted on patient-derived lymphocytes, complemented by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated MAP4K1 disruption and correction in primary T cells.
Results
Heterozygous MAP4K1 loss-of-function variants were identified in two kindreds presenting with diverse immune dysregulatory symptoms, including recurrent fevers, inflammatory arthritis, EBV-related complications, and nephritis. These variants led to reduced HPK1 protein levels and SLP-76Ser376 phosphorylation. While lymphocyte development was largely preserved, T cells from HPK1-deficient individuals displayed hyperresponsiveness to TCR stimulation, characterized by elevated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). CRISPR-mediated knockout recapitulated, and variant-correction partially reversed this phenotype. Transcriptomic profiling of stimulated CD4+ T cells further revealed upregulation of immune signaling pathways—including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and AP-1—as well as increased expression of multiple T cell cytokines, consistent with enhanced TCR signaling and T cell responses in HPK1-deficient individuals.
Conclusion
HPK1 deficiency, caused by heterozygous loss of MAP4K1, is a novel monogenic cause of immune dysregulation. Increased T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production are implicated in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Consumer research on conversational agents (CAs) has been growing. To illustrate and map out research in this field, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases. Four dominant topical areas were identified through bibliographic coupling. They are 1) consumers’ trust in CAs; 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) in developing and designing CAs; 3) communication with CAs; 4) impact of CAs on value creation and the value of CAs for business. We leverage these findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work. Moreover, we draw a framework whereby we identify the: 1) drivers of and motivators for adoption and engagement with CAs; and 2) the outcomes of CA adoption for both users and organizations. Finally, we leverage the framework to develop an agenda for future research.

AB  - Automatically tagging news articles is a fundamental task for indexing and analyzing news streams. Most news portals a form of article tagging ontology, which is a predefined set of tags or keywords that are assigned to news articles to improve their discoverability and relevance. However, manually categorizing and tagging news articles using an ontology is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, especially for news portals that publish a large volume of articles each day. The automation of the news article tagging process using machine learning techniques has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of manually categorizing and tagging a large volume of articles each day. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches for automatically tagging news articles. Specifically, we train and compare several models using both closed-ontology and open-ontology approaches. We evaluate the performance of these models based on their ability to accurately categorize and tag news articles using comparative human evaluation. Our findings provide insights into the advantages and limitations of each approach and highlight the potential applications of automatic news article tagging.

AB  - Electric buses (e-buses), e-vans, and e-trucks have the potential to improve both affordability and sustainability in transportation. With their higher annual kilometers traveled (AKT), these vehicles can significantly reduce emissions. Additionally, converting conventional motorcycles (CMs) to electric motorcycles (EMs) can directly lower the number of CMs on the road. However, studies on the total cost of ownership (TCO) of these types of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) remain limited in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Our study fills this gap by comparing the TCO of BEVs with their equivalent internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles across ASEAN countries. We calculate the TCO by summing the equity, loan installments, and operational and maintenance costs, then subtracting the vehicle's residual value. The cost inputs vary by country, depending on factors such as tax regulations, energy prices, incentives, interest rates, and other specific costs. Results show that e-buses generally have higher TCOs than ICE buses, except in Singapore. For e-trucks, the TCO remains higher due to the initial purchase costs. In contrast, e-vans typically have lower TCOs than ICE vans, except in Brunei Darussalam, where fuel prices are the lowest in ASEAN. Additionally, the TCO for converted EMs is lower than that of CMs. Our study also explores the potential for battery leasing and offers policy recommendations to improve cost competitiveness of BEVs. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers and stakeholders in advancing BEV adoption in ASEAN.

AB  - Hemodialysis membranes play a crucial role in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment by facilitating selective toxin removal while maintaining hemocompatibility. However, conventional polymeric membranes face limitations in permeability, fouling resistance, and biocompatibility, necessitating advanced material innovations. Despite significant progress, challenges such as protein adsorption, platelet activation, and biofouling compromise membrane performance, reducing dialysis efficiency and increasing clinical risks. To address these limitations, advanced polymeric, nanocomposite, biomimetic, and graphene-based membranes have been developed, yet issues related to stability, scalability, and regulatory approval remain critical barriers. This review evaluates the structure–property-performance relationships of emerging hemodialysis membranes, focusing on their advantages, limitations, and challenges. Surface modifications are conducted to enhance blood compatibility and reduce fouling. Nanocomposite membranes incorporating nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), silver (Ag), and graphene oxide (GO), improve antifouling properties and toxin removal. Biomimetic membranes, inspired by endothelial surfaces, utilize zwitterionic and heparin-like coatings to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce thrombogenicity. Meanwhile, graphene-based membranes exhibit ultrahigh permeability and selective uremic toxin clearance. By critically assessing these advancements, this paper highlights key strategies for overcoming current limitations and accelerating the development of next-generation hemodialysis membranes with improved efficiency, durability, and biocompatibility. Future research should prioritize scalable fabrication techniques, real-time performance monitoring, and clinical validation to facilitate widespread clinical adoption.

AB  - In recent years, the escalation of anthropogenic noise within marine environments has become a pressing ecological concern. Despite the proliferation of guidelines aimed at mitigating this issue, their adoption remains non-compulsory. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) advocates for noise reduction through the refinement of propeller design and heightened research to curtail acoustic emissions, ensuring that such measures do not compromise propulsive efficiency. This review delves into the array of strategies devised to attenuate noise pollution. It scrutinizes the methodologies employed to evaluate the hydroacoustic attributes of propellers, including experimental and computational approaches. Furthermore, it summarizes the techniques employed in the multiobjective optimization of propellers, which involves balancing the maximization of efficiency against the minimization of noise emission. The findings highlight the necessity for a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to the hydroacoustic optimization of marine propellers, encompassing cavitation experiments and advanced numerical simulations. In the field of propeller optimization, the traditional reliance on genetic algorithms is giving way to the adoption of neural networks and surrogate models derived from computational fluid dynamics data, particularly when addressing complex, nonlinear phenomena such as hydro-acoustics and cavitation.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining significant attention in various fields to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction. AI can be particularly beneficial in enhancing decision-making processes for complex and ill-structured problems that lack transparency and have unclear goals. Most AI algorithms require labeled datasets to learn the problem characteristics, draw decision boundaries, and generalize. However, most datasets collected to solve complex and ill-structured problems do not have labels. Additionally, most AI algorithms are opaque and not easily interpretable, making it hard for decision-makers to obtain model insights for developing effective solution strategies. To this end, we examine existing AI paradigms, mainly symbolic AI (SAI) guided by human domain knowledge and data-driven AI (DAI) guided by data. We propose an approach called informed AI (IAI) by integrating human domain knowledge into AI to develop effective and reliable data labeling and model explainability processes. We demonstrate and validate the use of IAI by applying it to a social media dataset comprised of conversations between customers and customer support agents to construct a solution – IAI defect explorer (I-AIDE). I-AIDE is utilized to identify product defects and extract the voice of customers to help managers make decisions to improve quality and enhance customer satisfaction.

AB  - This study investigates systemic risk spillovers across 49 Chinese financial institutions through incorporating investor sentiment. We enhance the tail-event driven network (TENET) model to better capture incremental changes and absorption effects in risk spillovers. Three distinct methods are employed to construct the investor sentiment index, enabling us to identify the most effective one. Our research reveals the following results. (1) The improved TENET model incorporating investor sentiment could better track real-time changes in systemic risk. (2) Risk spillover dynamics vary across sectors, while risk spill-in patterns remain consistent. (3) Intra-sector risk spillovers typically dominate, but extreme events amplify inter-sector spillovers. (4) The impact of the China-US trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic on risk spillovers across the financial sector is different. These findings provide regulatory implications for managing systemic risk during periods of extreme stress.

AB  - Summary
Adjuvants are immunostimulators used to enhance vaccine efficacy against infectious diseases. However, current methods for evaluating their efficacy and safety are limited, hindering large-scale screening. To address this, we developed a prototype Adjuvant Database (ADB) containing transcriptome data, generated using the same protocols as the widely used Open TG-GATEs (OTG) toxicogenomics database, covering 25 adjuvants across multiple species, organs, time points, and doses. This enabled cross-database integration of ADB and OTG. Transcriptomic patterns successfully distinguished each adjuvant regardless of organs or species. Using both databases, we built machine learning models to predict adjuvanticity and hepatotoxicity. Notably, we identified colchicine’s adjuvant activity and FK565’s liver toxicity through data-driven analysis. Overall, ADB combined with OTG offers a framework for transcriptomics-based, data-driven screening of adjuvant candidates.

AB  - This study presents Molecular Statistics (MST): a novel computational methodology designed to simulate thermodynamic properties of solid materials from room temperature to melting point with high efficiency. MST combines principles of statistical mechanics with molecular potentials, employing position distribution functions to generate atomic oscillations. Unlike conventional methods, MST enables fully independent and parallel calculations on small atomic sub-assemblies, reducing the computational load by orders of magnitude relative to molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. This approach bypasses the need for thermodynamic integration, directly sampling the Helmholtz free energy, which further minimizes computational expense. To validate MST, we benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art methods, including nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD), and the local harmonic approximation (LHA), a rapid yet less precise method. The evaluation demonstrates MST’s accuracy in predicting key thermodynamic properties, such as Gibbs free energy, entropy, and heat capacity, for several transition metals, aligning closely with experimental data. Furthermore, MST achieves these calculations within seconds, competitive with NEMD in both runtime and accuracy, underscoring its potential as an efficient alternative for high-temperature thermodynamic simulations. The MST framework thus emerges as a promising tool for materials science applications, particularly for complex systems where traditional methods become computationally prohibitive.

AB  - Objective
The current standards of postoperative respiratory monitoring on medical-surgical floors involve spot-pulse oximetry checks every 4–8 h, which can miss the opportunity to detect prolonged hypoxia and acute hypercapnia. Continuous respiratory monitoring can recognize acute respiratory depression episodes; however, the existing evidence is limited. We sought to review the current evidence on the effectiveness of continuous pulse oximetry (CPOX) with and without capnography versus routine monitoring and their effectiveness for detecting postoperative respiratory failure, opioid-induced respiratory depression, and preventing downstream adverse events.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature search on Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for articles published between 1990 and April 2023. The study protocol was registered in Prospero (ID: 439467), and PRISMA guidelines were followed. The NIH quality assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. Pooled analysis was conducted using the software R version 4.1.1 and the package meta. The stability of the results was assessed using sensitivity analysis.
Design
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
Setting
Postoperative recovery area.
Patients
56,538 patients, ASA class II to IV, non-invasive respiratory monitoring, and post-operative respiratory depression.
Interventions
Continuous pulse oximetry with or without capnography versus routine monitoring.
Measurements
Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, adverse events, and rescue events.
Results
23 studies (17 examined CPOX without capnography and 5 examined CPOX with capnography) were included in this systematic review. CPOX was better at recognizing desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) OR: 11.94 (95% CI: 6.85, 20.82; p < 0.01) compared to standard monitoring. No significant differences were reported for ICU transfer, reintubation, and non-invasive ventilation between the two groups.
Conclusions
Oxygen desaturation was the only outcome better detected with CPOX in postoperative patients in hospital wards. These comparisons were limited by the small number of studies that could be pooled for each outcome and the heterogeneity between the studies.
