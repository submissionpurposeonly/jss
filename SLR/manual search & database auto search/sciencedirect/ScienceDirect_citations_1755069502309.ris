AB  - Urban mobility is a complex system influenced by various factors such as infrastructure, technology, and human behavior. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating and understanding urban mobility dynamics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of ABM applications in urban human mobility, offering insights into prevailing trends in this field. The analysis of model scales highlights the predominance of area and city scales, highlighting the need for greater exploration at the intersection, metropolis, and street scales. Furthermore, the examination of technological environments shows a reliance on desktop and laptop computers, complemented by a growing adoption of specialized ABM tools such as SUMO, Anylogic, NetLogo, GAMA, and MATSim. Additionally, the study correlates ABM objectives with societal needs, revealing areas of alignment and gaps. While competitiveness and smart mobility receive considerable attention, there is a pronounced lack of focus on improving urban accessibility, sustainability, and public health. The analysis underscores the importance of addressing these gaps to ensure that ABM applications contribute effectively to addressing societal challenges.

AB  - In this paper, our objective is to find a balanced trade-off between interpretability and accurate, reliable Issue classification-specifically Bug severity-by creating an ensemble Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodological approach that enhances software maintenance in Agile development environments. Using the TAWOS dataset, we explored the capabilities of state-of-the-art models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), integrated with advanced NLP techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction. Our results demonstrate that CatBoost achieved superior performance, with accuracies of 99. 61 % for ‘high’ labeled severity bugs, 97.73 % for ‘Critical’, and 97.65 % for ‘Blocker’. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis further identified key semantic descriptors, such as “crash” and “timeout,” as critical predictors in these models. Moreover, this research addresses a critical gap in software engineering by improving the precision and efficiency of bug triaging processes, thereby supporting more effective resource allocation and reducing costs in Agile software projects. Finally, the comprehensive preprocessing pipeline we developed, including lemmatization, outlier removal, and non-oversampling techniques, was essential in optimizing model performance, offering a robust framework for enhancing software quality assurance.

AB  - The management and governance of forests must consider the synergies and trade-offs between different societal goals, especially with the bioeconomy being a key factor in recent sectoral strategies worldwide. This literature review explores the multidimensional concept of synergies and trade-offs, focusing on scientific publications dealing with the European forest bioeconomy. The objectives are twofold: 1) to provide an overview of the reviewed literature, including publication outlets, disciplinary diversity, and geographic scope of the studies; and 2) to analyze the synergies and trade-offs assessed by the reviewed articles, including the temporal scope of the assessment, the value chain segment considered, the methods used, and the policy implications and research gaps identified. The results show that European forest bioeconomy research concentrates on Finland, Sweden, and Germany, the three largest roundwood producers in the EU. The research is highly multidisciplinary (with a strong presence of social sciences), employing a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods. Out of the 138 studies reviewed, 22% explicitly analyze synergies and/or trade-offs in the forest bioeconomy. The reported synergies were widely varied, while most commonly reported trade-offs related to wood production versus climate change mitigation, biodiversity, and more generally other ecosystem services. The use of the synergy and trade-off concepts is often inexact, and the policy implications articulated in the literature are frequently formulated in generic terms, emphasizing communication. The findings and recommendations of this review are thus of relevance for both the scientific and practitioner/policy community.

AB  - Underground infrastructure, designed to last for decades, play a vital role in urban life. Its maintenance and upkeep have significant societal values and contribute to sustainability. Simulation and modelling along with digitisation and virtualisation as key technologies in the context of Industry 4.0 have fundamentally transformed delivery of engineering projects. With climate change pose pressing challenges on the physical environment of human dwelling, infrastructure resilience has been strategised as a sustainable development goal. Inception of Industry 5.0 has been formulated surrounding this need incentivising to build and maintain with sustainability, resilience and human-centric as core values. Digital twin (DT) paradigm facilitated by a series of cross-disciplinary technologies has emerged to play a role toward these targets. Along with data management and artificial intelligence (AI), DTs present transforming potentials from a technology-focus approach to a value-focus approach. This paper conducts a systematic review on generation and applications of DTs for underground infrastructure maintenance, highlighting the multi-physics, multi-scale, and interdisciplinary characteristics of underground infrastructure. After examining challenges and opportunities for underground infrastructure, and thoroughly reviewing the existing definitions and maturity levels of DT in Section 1, a DT framework for maintenance is established under the “Descriptive-Reflective-Predictive-Prescriptive” maturity model featuring progressive function requirements, forming 2 Descriptive twin, 2.1 BIM multi-system modelling, 2.1.1 BIM for underground infrastructure, 2.1.2 Geo- and structural model, 2.2 Functions and interoperability of digitalisation, 2.3 BIM for maintenance, 3 Reflective twin, 3.1 Sensing technologies, 3.2 Data-driven interpretation, 3.3 Data fusion and augmentation, 3.4 Interoperability and semantics, 4 Predictive twin, 4.1 Deterioration modelling, 4.1.1 Physics-based methods, 4.1.2 Machine learning methods, 4.2 Multi-physics simulation, 4.2.1 Interoperability and computational scalability, 4.2.2 Case studies, 4.3 Towards interpretable and reliable predictive twin, 5 Prescriptive twin of the paper. Section 2 focuses on reviewing information modelling techniques for creating a descriptive twin, essentially answering the question of “what is it”. Section 3 explores sensing technologies and data-driven analytics to develop a reflective twin, addressing applications requiring the knowledge of “what is happening”. Section 4 examines methods of deterioration modelling and multi-physics simulations to establish a predictive twin, providing insights into “what will happen”. Section 5 investigates approaches to intervention decision-making through service-oriented and multi-criteria frameworks, providing outlook into a prescriptive twin that addresses “what should be done”. Finally, a brief summary and some prospects requiring further investigations are presented.

AB  - This study explores the application of swarm robotics and swarm and evolutionary computing techniques in environmental management and sustainability, a highly specific and increasingly demanding niche research area. Through a bibliometric analysis of two collections of peer-reviewed papers, key trends and emerging research areas are identified. The first collection, comprising approximately 450 papers, focuses on specific applications of swarm robotics systems in environmental use cases, including swarms of UAVs, AUVs, and USVs, particularly in tasks such as ecological monitoring, agricultural management, and disaster response. This analysis highlights essential keyword clusters, with ``ecological restoration'' emerging as a significant topic, and ``agricultural robots'' and ``remote sensing'' as active frontiers. Building on this analysis, eight directions are proposed to address environmental challenges across five categories. The second collection, consisting of around 198 papers, examines the different swarm and evolutionary computing algorithms employed in this niche area, identifying ten significant research clusters. Notably, the ``secure incentive mechanism'' is a trending area, emphasizing the development of reliable and secure cooperative multi-robot systems. Recent methods in this cluster utilize deep reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithms to enhance cooperation efficiency. Five potential directions categorized into two main groups are explored to address security and reliability challenges within swarm robot systems in environmental tasks. The findings underscore the critical role of swarm robotics in environment-focused tasks such as ecosystem recovery and the importance of secure cooperation mechanisms, paving the way for advancements in agriculture, resource management, intelligent infrastructure, and urban systems.

AB  - Legal case precedents have a considerable impact on the development of litigation strategies. This research uses the neural network language modeling (NNLM) approach to analyze and identify judgment documents of US trademark (TM) litigation cases as precedents of a given target case. In this research, the NNLM has been trained using 4835 TM litigation documents. There are more than 800,000 words in the entire training text set including more than 150,000 vocabularies. The words in TM legal documents are vectorized to train the NN model for e-discovery of semantically correlated precedents and their features. Specifically, non-supervised machine learning (ML) methods, including clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are applied to form the TM legal document clusters, topics, and key terminologies used to characterize the TM case descriptions and precedents. The definition of the clusters, topics and corresponding key terms enhance the ability of the system to recommend and explain similar case judgments for any given TM case of interest or a cease and desist letter with detailed claims of infringement. Further, the intelligent approach provides macro and micro views for companies to research TM litigation trends as a means to better protect their brand equity.

By doing this, the article aims to identify research gaps that can guide future investigations. A total of 85 peer-reviewed articles from 2020 to 2023 were used in the analysis. The findings show that extant literature is skewed towards the prevalence of technological issues and highlights the relatively lower focus on other themes, such as contextual knowledge co-creation issues, conceptualisation, and application domains. While there have been increasing technological issues with artificial intelligence, the three identified areas of security concern are data security, model security and network security. Furthermore, the review found that contemporary AI, which continually drives the boundaries of computational capabilities to tackle increasingly intricate decision-making challenges, distinguishes itself from earlier iterations in two primary aspects that significantly affect organisational learning in dealing with AI's potential: autonomy and learnability. This study contributes to AI research by providing insights into current issues, research methodology, level of analysis and conceptual approaches, and AI framework to help identify research gaps for future investigations.

A systematic literature review of multidisciplinary literature was undertaken to assess existing deepfake definitions and synthesize a new definition to guide future theoretical development and empirical understanding of this communication innovation. Further, the systematic review identifies deepfake creators and those depicted by deepfakes and evaluates value creation and destruction implications of deepfakes for customers and organizations. Following the PRISMA protocol, this review evaluates deepfake research published between January 2017 and June 2021 across five databases, including only English literature from Q1/Q2 peer-reviewed journals. Eighty research articles were included in the final review. Using text mining software, a new deepfake definition is synthesized which encompasses the emerging concepts of “videos”, “audio”, “realistic”, “fake”, “artificial”, “learning”, “media”, and “saying”. Undetermined actors and individual content creators were most commonly identified as deepfake creators, whereas public figures, celebrities, and actors were most frequently depicted by deepfakes. Deepfakes potentially create and destroy value for customers and organizations. This study provides a new, holistic multidisciplinary definition of deepfakes, offers fresh insights into the use and impact of deepfakes as a communication innovation, and provides a new understanding of the value implications derived from deepfakes for innovation. Lastly, a future deepfake research agenda for innovation scholars is provided.

AB  - Background
With the influence of climate change, environmental pollution, global industrialization, and new agricultural practices, increasing amounts of chemical substances with potential risks—both anthropogenic and biogenic—enter the food supply chain, entailing new challenges to food safety and security. Although some food-risk components (FRCs) have been accessed and regulated, the toxicity and exposure level of the numerous components detected in food remain unknown, leaving questions on their effect on food safety. Therefore, multiple databases on emerging FRCs have been constructed to aid in food safety assessment, regulation, and communication; however, their focus areas, data content, quality, and accessibility have not been systematically summarized, which hinders their applications and the development of data-driven methods in the food safety field.
Scope and approach
The major objective of this review is to introduce representative FRC databases with different focus areas, along with their chemical presentation, data quality and availability, and successful applications.
Key findings and conclusions
Over the past decades, over 50 FRC databases have been released, contributing significantly to scientific research, policymaking, and education. However, our analysis unveils persistent challenges such as delayed updates, accessibility concerns, reproducibility issues, suboptimal data quality, and inadequate coverage in underdeveloped regions. To address these shortcomings, we propose an initiative aimed at enhancing future FRC databases, prioritizing the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. Additionally, we highlight the potential of future strategies, e.g., natural language processing, cheminformatics-enpowered suspect and non-targeted analysis, and genome mining, for the detection and analysis of emerging new FRCs outside of existing databases. By embracing these initiatives and strategies, we lay the groundwork for a robust framework facilitating enhanced food safety assessment and informed decision-making in the face of evolving challenges.

KW  - Bibliometric analysis
AB  - Studies on the total cost of ownership (TCO) of electric vehicles (EVs) have become a crucial topic in academic research. As EVs have gained prominence globally, the volume of research on this subject has increased. However, previous review studies have not focused on examining trends in research that estimates the TCO for all types and technologies of EVs. Thus, our study aims to fill this gap by reviewing global trends and results of TCO studies on EVs. Our review employs the method of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to systematically collect and analyse 185 articles from 2011 to 2024. The contributions of our review are fourfold. Firstly, we construct a thematic research map to understand which topics are densely connected, thereby highlighting the core themes and focal points of the research field. As a result, future research should focus on reducing the TCO to accelerate EV adoption. Secondly, we show that the most extensively analysed vehicle technologies are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), while passenger cars are the most studied vehicle type. Thirdly, we differentiate the objectives of the TCO studies, identifying motivation gaps among them. We found that the primary objectives of the reviewed studies are TCO comparisons, followed by battery size and powertrain designs, policy scenario analysis, and TCO model developments. Lastly, we provide the range of TCO estimates for different types and technologies of vehicles. The average TCO for BEVs is found to be higher than that for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) across passenger cars, buses, trucks, and cargo vans. Electric motorcycles, however, buck this trend, with their average TCO being slightly lower than that of conventional motorcycles. Based on the review results, we propose several recommendations for policy implications and future studies.

AB  - The Tadah! code provides a versatile platform for developing and optimizing Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs). By integrating composite descriptors, it allows for a nuanced representation of system interactions, customized with unique cutoff functions and interaction distances. Tadah! supports Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) to enhance model accuracy and uncertainty management. A key feature is its hyperparameter optimization cycle, iteratively refining model architecture to improve transferability. This approach incorporates performance constraints, aligning predictions with experimental and theoretical data. Tadah! provides an interface for LAMMPS, enabling the deployment of MLIPs in molecular dynamics simulations. It is designed for broad accessibility, supporting parallel computations on desktop and HPC systems. Tadah! leverages a modular C++ codebase, utilizing both compile-time and runtime polymorphism for flexibility and efficiency. Neural network support and predefined bonding schemes are potential future developments, and Tadah! remains open to community-driven feature expansion. Comprehensive documentation and command-line tools further streamline the development and application of MLIPs.
Program summary
Program title: Tadah! CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/vy6y3tjdr3.1 Developer's repository link: https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/tadah Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C++ Supplementary material: Installation instructions and usage examples are available in the Tadah! online documentation at https://tadah.readthedocs.io Nature of problem: Atomistic modelling, particularly molecular dynamics, is among the most popular techniques used in physics and chemistry research. Accurate and efficient methods are required to generate forces for such simulations. Quantum mechanical calculation of the electronic structure is the “gold standard” here, but is restricted to relatively small systems. Hence, interatomic potentials have a role in allowing large scale simulations, provided they have adequate accuracy. Over the past two decades, the paradigm has shifted from developing interatomic potentials using physics-informed functional forms to generating machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with more flexible mathematical forms, albeit lacking clear interpretability. MLIPs typically lack physical insights in trained models, requiring comprehensive datasets from methods like density functional theory during model parametrization. While training on energies and derivatives may ensure good interpolation within the training data, it frequently lacks transferability, failing environments unlike those in the training data. At the same time the ability to fit a model to experimental data increasingly seems to be lost. In essence, the MLIP framework includes a feature vector (descriptor/fingerprint) and a regression method (e.g., kernel ridge regression or neural networks). Currently, there are numerous frameworks, but there is no consensus on a superior approach. Competing factors such as accuracy, transferability, efficiency, and dataset requirements influence user decisions. Because of the fragmentation of the methodologies, users frequently need to compile multiple software tools, which then often prove to be not end-user-ready. A niche exists for a more flexible framework within which users can mix and match descriptor and regression methods. This would allow MLIP developers to experiment, test, and rapidly deploy models to production, using the methods best suited to their system, application and target outputs. It is desirable to provide additional tools for fitting and verification of models. Furthermore, deployment in molecular dynamics (MD) settings, requires effort to integrate the MLIP with third-party MD software. Plugins for standard MD codes should be available alongside MLIP fitting codes. Solution method: Tadah! is a unified program designed for the development of advanced machine learning interatomic potentials using various descriptors, cutoffs, and regression methods. It also allows rapid deployment of these through the MD LAMMPS plugin [1]. It supports mono- and multi-species systems as well as advanced (custom) fitting procedures. The software provides unique pathways to embed prior domain knowledge into a model and offers a range of additional tools for dataset conversion, manipulation, and plotting. Tadah! allows users to incorporate their physical insight by combining multiple descriptors into a single composite descriptor. Each constituent descriptor can be further customized by specifying a unique cutoff function and distance. Additionally, users can define specific chemical species pairs that each constituent descriptor will target, enabling tailored interactions within the model. Tadah! also provides users with a nested fitting procedure that allows the optimization of model hyperparameters with a custom-defined loss function. In principle, the loss function can incorporate any quantity obtainable from MD simulation and be compared against experimental values for scoring. The Tadah! toolkit provides a command-line interface (CLI) binary as well as a C++ API for advanced use. The majority of features are available via the CLI, while the API allows developers and users to rapidly implement and test new descriptors and various regression strategies. It supports seamless integration of new types of descriptors, with an API that enables their addition. We follow the philosophy: “Implement once, use it everywhere across Tadah! and LAMMPS.” The code is open source, and we aim to drive development based on user feedback. We encourage users to request new features and provide feedback. We are also open to individual contributions and collaborations. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Tadah! provides two end-user packages: Tadah!MLIP for the development of MLIPs and Tadah!LAMMPS for deployment in molecular dynamics settings. The Tadah!MLIP software can be built as a desktop version using OpenMP. For users working with large datasets or complex descriptors, a massively parallel version of Tadah!MLIP is available with MPI, designed for HPC architectures.

AB  - This study optimized microwave drying of Ocimum sanctum (basil) leaves with chitosan coating pretreatment to improve drying efficiency and environmental impact. A bibliometric analysis revealed limited research on microwave-assisted drying methods combined with pretreatments. Using the Box-Behnken Design (BBD) within the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the study evaluated the effects of drying time, microwave power, basil leaf mass, and chitosan concentration. Results showed that the optimum drying parameters were: drying time of 240 s, microwave power of 264.03 W, basil leaf mass of 14.36 g, and chitosan concentration of 1.39 %. Under these conditions, the moisture removal efficiency reached 61.6184 %, with relative energy consumption of 0.9698 kWh g-1 and CO2 emissions of 0.7758 kg g-1. The findings demonstrate that microwave drying with chitosan coating reduces energy consumption and environmental emissions while maintaining product quality.

AB  - Integrating renewable energy sources into electricity systems is essential for achieving a sustainable, low-carbon future. Despite the benefits, the intermittent and variable nature of renewable power generation introduces significant challenges, highlighting the need for increased system flexibility. Although previous studies emphasize the importance of incentives to attract customer participation in flexibility provision and to ensure the viability of the aggregator business model, there remains a lack of a systematic, comprehensive, and integrated incentive model. This research introduces a comprehensive Incentive-Based Framework designed to harmonise the objectives of three key stakeholders: aggregators, small-load flexibility providers (customers), and system operators, including distribution and transmission system operators. The development of this framework employs a dual-review approach. Initially, a literature review establishes the foundational principles critical for the viability of the aggregator business model. Subsequently, a review of existing projects examines flexibility initiatives across the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom, identifying key components currently in use. This second phase exploits extensive, publicly accessible data from the mature U.S. market and enhances the model with insights from European projects. By integrating these analyses, the framework effectively aligns financial and operational aspects of flexibility provision with the perceived value from the customer's perspective, supporting the sustainability of aggregating flexibility from small customers. The findings and recommendations of this study offer valuable insights for policymakers, market operators, and stakeholders, fostering active customer engagement and facilitating the successful integration of renewable energy sources into electricity systems.

AB  - Background
Spillover effects of pain medication tapering (PMT) programs in patients with chronic pain (CP) are underexplored. This systematic review presents current research on the study of spillover effects of PMT in patients with CP and provides suggestions for examination of spillover effects in health economic research of PMT. Understanding spillover effects enable wide-ranging assessment of interventions, including its broader impacts.
Methods
Literature was searched up to September 2023 in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsychINFO, APA PsychNet, Cochrane library, Econlit, and grey literature sources including Google Scholar, CADTH, Mednar and the WHO website. QualSyst was used for Risk of bias assessment. The study protocol was registered prospectively in PROSPERO (CRD42023461763). Results were classified into five domains and incorporated into the expanded impact inventory framework. No funding was obtained.
Results
Of 2099 records initially identified, six qualitative studies of varying quality were included. In the healthcare domain, additional demands on healthcare delivery, patients switching between healthcare providers and psychosocial impacts for healthcare providers were key findings. Scientific spillovers entailed evidence-based recommendations, enhanced PMT awareness and knowledge dissemination. Sociological effects encompassed bias affecting underrepresented groups and community-level benefits. No spillovers were found in other categories. Future research should extend beyond patient-centered outcomes to comprehensively assess PMT’s societal impact and reveal indirect benefits currently underrepresented in the literature.
Conclusions
Spillover effects of PMT in patients with CP were identified. Considering spillovers can allow policymakers to optimize healthcare policies and resource allocation in healthcare. Inclusion of only six studies is a limitation of this study.

AB  - Purpose
The imbalance of thyroid hormones affects the metabolic activity of various tissues, including periodontium. Also, autoimmune diseases present an increased tendency to suffer from periodontal disease. Therefore, our systematic review was designed to answer the question "Is there a relationship between thyroid diseases and periodontal disease?".
Materials and methods
Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 studies were included in this systematic review using the databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science (according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines).
Results
Based on the meta-analysis, patients with thyroid diseases (especially with hypothyroidism) demonstrated significantly worse periodontal status than systemically healthy controls. Moreover, according to the cross-sectional studies, 5.74 ​% of periodontitis patients reported the concomitance of thyroid diseases.
Conclusions
In summary, the included studies suggest a potential relationship between thyroid diseases and periodontal disease. However, further research is necessary to reliably assess the oral health in patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Consumer food waste has significant impacts worldwide. Consumers are confused about date labels and are discarding food that is still edible. Inconsistent storage advice contributes to confusion and prevents consumers from properly storing food. This paper examines consumer perceptions and understanding of date labels and on-pack storage advice and how they make decisions about food. A systematic scoping review was undertaken to comprehensively search for existing scholarly and grey literature. Results show that consumers find date labels confusing and hard to understand. The confusion and difficulty are due to interpretation, inconsistent placement, poor legibility, and different label-type meanings. Furthermore, the study did not identify any articles that studied the impact of visual semiotics (i.e., visual cues) of packaging or labels on consumer decision-making about food that leads to household food waste. Of 92 papers, 38 explored the relationship between date labelling and food waste. Six papers explored storage advice in conjunction with food waste. Future research should focus on: 1) understanding packaging design's role in reducing food waste, including visual cues that reduce cognitive load and complexity, 2) studying how Global South countries address consumer food waste, and 3) exploring system tensions and opportunities to improve labels and packaging to reduce consumer food waste. The review establishes that the outcome of consumer confusion is household food waste. By understanding what causes consumer confusion and influences consumer choices, we can improve existing date label and storage advice systems to enable consumers to make informed decisions about food waste more easily.

AB  - The impact of light on circadian rhythms, alertness, and well-being is widely recognized. Advancements in lighting research emphasize the importance of understanding these effects, mainly by measuring personal light dose, considering timing, intensity, duration, and spectrum. Therefore, new monitoring devices have been developed to measure individual light exposure and improve light dose analysis on circadian rhythms. Currently available devices include wearable sensors and low-cost, open-source, solutions that are adaptable and widely applicable. These wearables, when used alongside other measurement tools and standardized protocols, offer a comprehensive means to study light exposure in real-world conditions. However, despite the growing availability of these technologies, there is a lack of systematic evaluation regarding their accuracy, reliability, and applicability in both research and practical settings. This review explores recent developments in wearable technologies for monitoring the non-visual effects of light on humans. Emphasizing the role of circadian rhythms, it discusses how light exposure influences alertness, mood, and overall health and well-being. A range of monitoring devices is evaluated, highlighting variations in functionality and way of wearing, while identifying data reliability and standardization gaps. This review paper aims to emphasize the importance of integrating different measurement tools, combining environmental monitoring (e.g., light exposure), physiological assessments (e.g., heart rate, body temperature), and personal feedback (e.g., subjective reports on alertness and well-being). The review results highlight a more holistic approach to studying the impact of light on humans. Furthermore, it proposes future research directions and practical applications to enhance health outcomes through personalized light management strategies.

AB  - The production of chemical pesticides poses a critical threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, with sub-lethal impacts evident at even relatively low concentrations. Historically, ecotoxicologists have ignored an organism's social context when investigating the effects of pesticide exposure and, instead, have tended to focus on individual-level impacts. Recently, however, there has been a growing interest in understanding the impacts of pesticide exposure on social behaviour. Despite this shift, a holistic understanding of how pesticides impact conspecific interactions (i.e., social behaviour towards individuals of the same species) is lacking due to the multitude of behaviours, pesticides and species currently investigated. In this meta-analysis, we examine the effects of pesticide exposure on conspecific interactions in fish by using data collected from 37 studies on 31 pesticides and 11 species. Our results indicate that pesticide exposure generally reduces the expression of conspecific interactions, but it does not affect the variability of responses between individuals. Courtship behaviour was the most impaired, suggesting that pesticide exposure could weaken how matings are partitioned among individuals in a population. Triazoles and organochlorines were the most impactful pesticide classes for mean differences in behaviour, while triazoles and organophosphates had the greatest effects on response variability. These findings indicate that endocrine-disrupting and neurotoxic pesticides can impact fish conspecific interactions, regardless of their chemical class. Unfortunately, there is a large taxonomic bias in the literature, with most studies using zebrafish as a model, which, in turn, provides scope for studies using a broader range of fish species. We found little statistical evidence of publication biases in our dataset and our results were validated by sensitivity analyses. Overall, our synthesis suggests that pesticides broadly reduce the expression of social behaviours, though effects vary across behaviours, pesticide types, and fish species.

AB  - Eutrophication of inland water bodies is a serious environmental threat. This review explores current integrated models for lake and reservoir ecosystems that focus on nutrient dynamics at a catchment scale. Many studies applied either watershed or lake/reservoir models, however, 49 studies were finally selected that combined both. We derived a list of 21 watershed models, 23 lake/reservoir models, and 6 hybrid models in different sets of combinations, with a range of objectives (e.g. understanding the natural processes, predicting, and analysing climate change and land-use scenarios, or evaluating the different management options). Some integrated models had multiple applications whereas others were only applied once, with an uneven global geographical distribution. To aid model selection by future users, we present a support tool discriminating the models by their features and application fields. This study encourages the development of open-source tools aiding interdisciplinary collaborations and further research in the field of integrated modelling.

AB  - The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly, compelling companies to integrate it within their operational frameworks to sustain competitiveness, primarily driven by its impact on organizational agility (OA). Nevertheless, the absence of a robust theoretical framework underscores the limited understanding of the relationship between AI and OA. Within this context, the research aims to establish foundational knowledge, delineate the evolutionary trajectory of the topic, and identify prospective avenues for inquiry. To achieve this objective, bibliometric analysis is employed to gain comprehensive insights into the interplay between these variables and discern trends within this research domain. The utilization of the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases up to January 2024 facilitates data collection, while Bibliometrix and Visme are instrumental in crafting a scientific production map. The analysis corroborates the novelty and growth potential of the subject matter, underscoring heightened author interest, particularly evident in 2023, against a backdrop of sparse and temporally dispersed publications until 2017. Notably, the prevalence of conference papers on this topic stands significantly high at 26.98 % in comparison to the total contributions, indicative of the research community's engagement. Furthermore, the findings underscore a robust association between the keywords AI and OA, delineating a burgeoning research domain that converges with the digital transformation of enterprises and the Theory of Standardization Process. The effective integration of AI into corporate operational frameworks marks the zenith of this transformative process, ushering in the genesis and overhaul of organizational routines. This study represents a pioneering endeavour within the literature, as it constitutes the inaugural bibliometric exploration of this subject matter. Moreover, it serves to underpin the establishment of theoretical underpinnings for future research endeavours as it outlines current trends and emerging future research trajectories, concerning the role of AI in OA.

AB  - Pragmatic impairment is diffused in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, but the literature still debates its neurocognitive underpinnings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the neurocognitive correlates of pragmatic disorders in schizophrenia and determine the weight of social cognition and executive functioning on such disorders. Of the 2,668 records retrieved from the literature, 16 papers were included in the systematic review, mostly focused on non-literal meanings and discourse production in schizophrenia. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis: pragmatics was moderately associated with both social cognition and executive functions (especially inhibition), but the link with social cognition was stronger. The mediation analysis showed that social cognition mediated the relationship between executive functions and pragmatics. Based on this, we proposed a hierarchical neurocognitive model where pragmatics stems from social cognition, while executive functions are the fertile ground supporting the other two domains, and we discuss its theoretical and clinical implications.

AB  - Objectives
The aim of the review was to map the current landscape of dental stem cell manufacturing practice and biobanking for clinical use and to identify variable factors that may hinder clinical translation and standardization of dental stem cell-based therapy.
Data sources
An electronic search was performed using Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, using “Dental stem cells” and “Dental pulp stem cells” as keywords. In addition, ClinicalTrials.gov was used to identify clinical trials of dental stem cells for therapeutic purposes. Relevant articles and bibliographic references from the reviewed studies were used to develop the narrative review.
Study selection
The initial search yielded 48 records from PubMed, 66 from Scopus, 33 from Web of Science, and 23 registered trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. In total, 23 registered trials were identified, of which 14 involved the therapeutic use of dental stem cells in clinical settings. For reviewing the current practices of dental stem cell manufacturing for clinical use, 20 studies were selected for an in-depth full-text analysis, among which fifteen and five articles addressed the ex-vivo expanding cells and chair-side preparation of micrograft containing dental stem cells, respectively.
Conclusion
Although dental stem cells have been applied in clinical settings for regenerative therapies, cell manufacturing practices have varied widely across reported cases, reflecting a lack of standardization. Furthermore, dental-specific challenges—such as logistical constraints and the complex involvement of multiple stakeholders—hinder compliance with stringent regulatory requirements, contributing to slower clinical translation compared to somatic-cell therapy medicine in other fields. This highlights a need for global collaboration among academia, industry, clinicians, and regulators to establish standardized practice, enhance predictability, and ensure long-term traceability.
Clinical significance
Dental stem cells have been used in clinical settings, with private practitioners playing a leading role in translating them into regenerative therapies in dentistry. This trend is expected to accelerate, driven by the growing number of enterprises entering the global dental stem cell biobanking market. Currently, cell manufacturing protocols vary widely across organizations with intricated regulatory framework applied. Furthermore, uncertainties remain regarding the use of long-term cryopreserved dental stem cells and the regulatory interpretation of such products.

AB  - Occupational health risks such as falls from height, electrocution, object strikes, mechanical injuries, and collapses have plagued the construction industry. Deep learning algorithms are exploding due to their outstanding analytical capabilities and are believed to improve safety management significantly. Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed the literature on DL algorithms from 2015 to 2024 in modular construction. It found that the six most popular DL algorithms in this area are “Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),” “Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),” “Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),” “Auto-Encoder (AE),” “Deep Belief Network (DBN)” and “Transformer.” However, in addition to each algorithm's limitations, problems like data constraints, talent gaps, and a lack of guidance frameworks also exist. To address these issues, three strategies are proposed. They are “establishing a multi-modal data sharing platform,” “proposing a paradigm framework for the application of DL algorithms,” and “constructing a compound construction talent training mechanism,” which provide researchers with future references.

AB  - In recent years, significant attention has been paid to fuzzy recommender systems for housing, highlighting their ability to effectively handle the imprecision and uncertainty inherent in the real estate market. With the objective of improving the filtering of recommendations in the real estate sector, the PRISMA 2020 methodology was applied to perform new systematic reviews using its checklist on six academic databases from 1985 to 2024. RawGraph, Orange Data Minig, Jamovi and R software were used for document classification and data visualization. After classification, 1003 articles were obtained, of which 46.36% were in Scopus, and 57.82% were articles. At the end of the type, 50 articles were identified as primary, subjecting them to six research questions. It was found that 65% of the algorithms used fuzzy logic, 60% used spatial data, and 80% evaluated performance. The main difficulties were related to the integration of various sources of information. Although incorporating reclusive methods is anticipated in future systems, the need remains to address challenging areas to improve the overall performance of fuzzy recommender systems. The reviewed articles focus on enhancing fuzzy data-based recommendation systems by proposing flexible and less intrusive techniques. The significance of incorporating contextual information and exploring hybrid approaches is emphasized, along with the evaluation in real world environments, averaging artificial intelligence.

AB  - Power plants are among the largest contributors to CO2 emissions, making carbon capture and conversion into valuable products a key strategy to combat climate change and foster a circular economy. However, selecting the optimal CO2 capture technology is complex due to the wide range of options — such as pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion — and the various technical, economic, environmental, and social factors involved. This study identifies the most promising CO2 capture technologies for three power plant types: Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC), lignite, and coal. By applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which integrates a systematic literature review with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the study ranks existing technologies. For NGCC plants, post-combustion calcium looping emerged as the top choice, with a relative closeness score of 0.790, due to its moderate CO2 avoidance cost (€33.80/tCO2), high efficiency (48.31%), and mature Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7. In lignite plants, post-combustion chemical absorption with MDEA ranked highest, achieving a relative closeness of 0.865 and a TRL of 9. For coal plants, pre-combustion using the Selexol process combined with Mn-based chemical looping was most promising, with a relative closeness of 0.829, low CO2 avoidance cost (€19.94/tCO2), and a net efficiency of 37.13%. These findings underscore the importance of balancing economic performance and technological maturity when selecting CO2 capture technologies.

AB  - The major and upward trend in the number of published research related to rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, in which artificial intelligence plays a key role, has exhibited the interest of rheumatology researchers in using these techniques to answer their research questions. In this review, we analyse the original research articles that combine both worlds in a five- year period (2017–2021). In contrast to other published papers on the same topic, we first studied the review and recommendation articles that were published during that period, including up to October 2022, as well as the publication trends. Secondly, we review the published research articles and classify them into one of the following categories: disease identification and prediction, disease classification, patient stratification and disease subtype identification, disease progression and activity, treatment response, and predictors of outcomes. Thirdly, we provide a table with illustrative studies in which artificial intelligence techniques have played a central role in more than twenty rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Finally, the findings of the research articles, in terms of disease and/or data science techniques employed, are highlighted in a discussion. Therefore, the present review aims to characterise how researchers are applying data science techniques in the rheumatology medical field. The most immediate conclusions that can be drawn from this work are: multiple and novel data science techniques have been used in a wide range of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases including rare diseases; the sample size and the data type used are heterogeneous, and new technical approaches are expected to arrive in the short-middle term.

AB  - Under the intensive sheep farming model, traditional monitoring and management methods face issues such as outdated equipment and low efficiency, which cannot fully meet the requirements for refined and intelligent management in breeding. This paper reviews the application of non-invasive monitoring technology in intensive sheep farms, analyzing the differences and application scenarios between contact and non-contact sensors. The results show that contact sensors have advantages such as relatively precise, continuous, and accurate monitoring of individual animals with minimal stress responses during use. However, they also have drawbacks, including wear and tear caused by stress and high equipment maintenance costs. Non-contact sensors, on the other hand, offer advantages such as scalability for group use, high accuracy, non-interference with sheep behavior, and no disruption of flock habits. Non-invasive monitoring technology demonstrates good accuracy and applicability in individual identification, behavior analysis, body measurement parameters, and physiological indicators. In the future, through in-depth integration of multidisciplinary and multi-field approaches and deep learning of multiple algorithms, non-invasive monitoring technology is expected to develop towards low cost and intelligence, providing a comprehensive solution for smart animal husbandry.

AB  - The operation of buildings accounts for approximately 40% of global energy consumption and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions. Retrofitting existing buildings has become essential to mitigating these impacts, yet the process presents complex optimisation challenges that require balancing conflicting objectives, such as minimising energy consumption, reducing costs, and improving thermal comfort. This systematic review investigates the application of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to building retrofits, with a particular focus on their use in multi-objective optimisation. By analysing 175 studies − 118 new publications and 57 from a prior review – this work identifies key trends, challenges, and advancements in GA-based retrofitting approaches. The findings reveal that NSGA-II remains the most widely adopted GA, demonstrating strengths in computational efficiency and solution quality. An increasing integration of life-cycle analysis and dynamic simulation tools, such as EnergyPlus, reflects the growing sophistication of optimisation strategies. However, significant challenges persist, including prolonged computation times, a lack of open data, and limited consideration of occupant preferences and indoor environmental quality. This review systematically highlights these limitations in optimisation formulation, such as stakeholder conflicts, model sensitivity to climate variability, and scalability across different building types. By presenting these insights, this review offers a practical framework for researchers and practitioners to navigate the complexities of GA-based optimisation for building retrofitting. Recommendations include enhancing the accessibility of tools, incorporating emerging materials and technologies, and addressing climate change through tailored retrofit simulations. This work aims to advance the theoretical and practical application of GAs, contributing to the development of efficient, scalable, and equitable retrofit strategies.

AB  - This study investigated the evolution and effectiveness of retail technology in sustainability practices through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 52 key publications (2006–2024). A mixed-methods approach was employed by combining bibliometric analysis with the theory-context-characteristics-methods framework, utilizing the SPAR-4-SLR protocol and VOSviewer software for network visualization and thematic clustering. The analysis revealed seven research clusters, with "circular economy and waste management" and "environmental policy and energy transition" emerging as dominant themes (25 % and 22 % of citations, respectively). Resource-based view theory was most prevalent (7 articles), followed by the triple bottom line and circular economy approach (6 articles each). Methodologically, quantitative studies (44.2 %) outnumbered qualitative (34.6 %) and mixed methods (21.2 %). Technology integration demonstrated average efficiency improvements of 15–20 % in supply chain operations, with peak gains of 30 % in optimization and 25 % in waste reduction. Implementation success rates showed notable disparities between developed (25 %) and developing markets (18 %). This study provides the first comprehensive bibliometric mapping of retail technology sustainability research, revealing distinct methodological patterns and highlighting the influence of cultural and regional differences on implementation effectiveness.

AB  - Introduction: This research implements the steps of developing or identifying leading indicators (LIs) delineated in a previously published conceptual model to test its practicality on case study data. Concomitant objectives are (a) to systematically review extant literature of ‘LIs development and identification’ to develop an analytical framework for identifying LIs; and to identify LIs from case study incident reports and normative documents using the framework. Method: To empirically validate the conceptual model, a two staged data analysis process was adopted: (1) a theoretical work stage, where pertinent literature was studied through systematic literature review using Scopus and Web of Science databases and a detailed framework analysis; and (2) practical work stage, where an inductively developed analytical framework and insights gained from the theoretical work stage were applied to real-life case study data and their apposite normative documents. Random sampling was used to select 12 different case studies of accidents from a private database of 97 case studies. In total, 2,423 LIs were identified from extant literature and through framework analysis using the bespoke analytical framework generated, a total of 484 LIs were identified from a combination of selected case study materials and their relevant normative documents. All these 484 newly developed LIs were contrasted with a compilation of the previously published 2,423 LIs in the literature. Results: Consequently, a total of 232 LIs out of 484 were recognized as entirely new and novel. These LIs were then thematically grouped into 19 clusters for brevity. A novel analytical framework for identifying new LIs was inductively developed. The framework enables identification of LIs from a qualitative dataset and classify them into eight types of LIs. Practical Applications: This novel research constitutes the first attempt to identify and validate LIs via the use of an analytical framework and real-life case study data.

AB  - The reliability of infrastructure that is critical to society’s functionality, survival and progression has gained significance for both national security and research because of its large-scale and interdependent nature. However, the theoretical basis of the relatively new research field of critical infrastructure is incomplete and the common parlance about the underlying concepts is ambiguous. This article addresses this issue and presents the results of a substantial review of scientific literature on the concepts of systems, infrastructure and governance. The results demonstrate that the concepts encounter a common challenge in characterising their key elements, structures and processes because of their recursive nature. The multi-level character of critical infrastructure systems provokes governance to systemically address the properties of adaption, emergence and entropy which the complex system-of-systems exhibits. This article contributes with both a conceptual study of the terms system, infrastructure and governance and a detailed review of the state of the art regarding these concepts in the current scientific literature to an enhanced understanding of the theoretical foundations of the associated fields. Subsequent research could interrelate other concepts, such as vulnerability, resilience, sustainability and feedback with the provided state of the art.

AB  - Agrivoltaic (AV) systems have emerged as a transformative solution to address the interrelated global challenges of food security, water conservation, and renewable energy generation. This study aims to provide a systematic review of 33 studies published between 2013 and 2023, analyzing the impacts of AV systems on microclimate regulation, evapotranspiration (ET), soil evaporation, water-use efficiency (WUE), and crop yield across diverse agricultural and climatic contexts. The findings highlight that AV systems improve WUE by 20–47 %, lower air and soil temperatures by 1–4 °C, and enhance crop resilience in water-scarce regions. However, yield reductions are observed in light-dependent crops under high shading intensities, underscoring the need for tailored designs that optimize shading intensity while balancing energy generation and agricultural productivity. Advanced technologies, such as dynamic shading systems and semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) panels, are identified as critical for maximizing AV efficiency and adaptability to specific regional needs. This study also addresses significant gaps in the literature, including the underrepresentation of tropical and arid climates, insufficient long-term ecological assessments, and the lack of comprehensive economic feasibility analyses for large-scale implementation. By integrating geographic and temporal trends, diverse methodological approaches, and innovative PV technologies, this study provides actionable research directions for optimizing AV system scalability and sustainability, advancing AV systems as a cornerstone of climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture.

AB  - This study presents a bibliometric analysis of the experimental literature on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production from organic waste streams using waste activated sludge (WAS) as inoculum over the last ten years (2014–2024). A total of 159 experimental articles were compiled through a systematic search in Scopus and Web of Science, followed by performance analysis, co-citation analysis, and bibliometric coupling using VOSviewer software. The results reveal a notable surge in publications in recent years, particularly in 2021, reflecting growing academic and industrial interest in sustainable plastic alternatives. This momentum is linked to environmental concerns, supply chain disruptions, and increased investment in bio-based solutions following the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy and China lead in publication volume, while Portugal, particularly Universidade Nova de Lisboa, stands out institutionally. Despite these advances, industrial participation remains limited, with Veolia Water Technologies as the only company with a consistent academic footprint. Co-citation analysis identified three major clusters shaping the intellectual structure: (i) enrichment strategies and process setup, (ii) feedstock for PHA production by microbial mixed cultures (MMCs), and (iii) PHA production integrated with waste treatment at pilot scale. Bibliographic coupling revealed three emerging research trends: (i) biopolymer modification, (ii) diversification of organic substrates, and (iii) development of eco-friendly extraction methods. By focusing on the transformation of organic waste into bioplastics, this study highlights the relevance of PHA research within the circular economy framework, in which waste streams are revalorized into renewable, biodegradable materials. The findings provide valuable insights for guiding future research and innovation.

AB  - Introduction
Recent high-profile cases of police misconduct have revealed that officers were often aware of misconduct, but remained silent, compromising public trust in law enforcement. Here, we systematically review ‘police whistleblowing’ literature to identify barriers and facilitators to officers challenging misconduct.
Methodology
Employing PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed 118 relevant papers, extracting data and coding key variables including who the ‘target’ of the research was; whether reporting practices were studied, and whether practical solutions were offered. A reflexive thematic analysis then assessed consensus among researchers within the literature.
Results
Five themes - 1) knowledge and rules, 2) consequences, 3) interpersonal relations, 4) responsibility, and 5) police culture and group relations – emerged as barriers and facilitators to whistleblowing. The review revealed relatively poorer representation of internal police reporting structures and limited practical solutions, with only 40 papers proposing strategies, predominantly centred on training and education.
Discussion
This review highlights methodological limitations in existing research, with an overreliance on survey methods and a dominant focus on the characteristics of individuals over the structural constraints of reporting. The positive impacts of whistleblowing on policing as an institution and the development of practical strategies to overcome officers' reluctance to report misconduct remain largely unexplored.

AB  - The field of construction labor productivity (CLP) has witnessed a remarkable growth in scholarly research, presenting both opportunities and challenges due to the diverse focus and exponential increase in literature. This study aims to systematically review the burgeoning body of CLP literature, proposing an approach to tackle the complexity of the domain. Utilizing the text mining technique of Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HLDA), an automatic clustering method was developed to analyze and categorize the corpus of CLP research. The methodology involved a comprehensive extraction of 591 scholarly articles from scientific databases. These articles, spanning from 1973 to 2023, were subjected to HLDA topic modeling. This process generated a detailed three-layer, tree-like topic model, comprising three primary topics and 26 sub-topics, organized through the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). The study advances theoretical and practical understanding by applying hierarchical topic modeling to construction project management literature and identifying key industry challenges.

This scoping review addressed five research questions: 1. How did the typology of publications, both theoretical and empirical, evolve considering the different stages of intellectual capital? 2. What are the milestone studies marking the beginning of the five stages of evolution of the intellectual capital framework? 3. How has the intellectual capital construct evolved? 4. What are the main streams of research on intellectual capital and how are they characterised? 5. What are the most relevant topics, gaps, and future trends in the field of intellectual capital? To answer the research questions, a scoping review was conducted following a search of the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases. The final search identified 78 full-text articles, published between 2005 and 2023. The evidence revealed the emergence of new topics and identified 13 clusters. We found evidence of the beginning of the fifth stage around 2018 due to the change in the research paradigm observed in this study and the development of new themes, such as innovation, digitalisation, knowledge, sustainability, and entrepreneurship, contributing to the ecosystem development of cities, regions, and nations. This pioneering scoping review systematised literature reviews about intellectual capital, providing important implications for theory, as it presents paths to follow and relevant indications for the evolving fifth stage of intellectual capital.

AB  - The concept of Industry 5.0 underscores the societal importance of aligning digital technologies, human centrality (including work), and sustainability within production systems. However, its practical implementation faces significant challenges. Considering the central role of work in production systems as envisioned by ergonomics, this study addresses the following research question: What is the role of work, and how can it contribute to ensuring that technology-intensive production systems align with the principles of Industry 5.0, making them human-centered, sustainability-driven, and resilient? In this context, the objective of this research is (i) to map scientific contributions that connect digital technologies, sustainability, and work in production systems, (ii) to investigate gaps and opportunities in scientific literature and possible contributions related to the discipline of ergonomics and (iii) propose theoretical and practical implications. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted in the Scopus database, aiming to identify studies that connected the three themes. A final sample of 115 articles was obtained, which served as the basis for a content analysis. The results revealed scientific contributions linking digital technologies and work within the context of sustainable development and corporate sustainability. The study also identified seven groups of papers (technology improvement, competent workers, interaction, expanded capabilities, work management, training and embodying) focusing on the intersection of work and digital technology, specifically, ways in which technology influences work/worker and vice versa. Future studies are called to deepen the theoretical concept of Industry 5.0; develop tools, frameworks and indicators; develop more empirical studies; focus more on the role of the worker; and develop solutions to monitor the impacts of technology on work overtime. This study also reinforces the potential of using the discipline of ergonomics as theoretical background to leapfrog knowledge for this research agenda. This is because this discipline has been already developing knowledge on the connection between work and sustainability towards different lines of research that can also be applied in the context of production systems with intensive use of digital technologies. Based on this, theoretical implications for researchers and practical implications for organizations and policymakers were defined, aiming to build human-centered and sustainable production systems.

AB  - The urgency of addressing global challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation has positioned the Circular Economy (CE) as a crucial strategy for sustainable development. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies have been recognized as key enablers of CE. However, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding how organizations can effectively integrate these technologies with CE strategies. Existing integration frameworks often focus narrowly on specific industries, technologies, or the traditional 3R model, neglecting the broader 10R framework and, hence, offering limited guidance. This paper addresses these gaps by developing a comprehensive 10R-based integration framework, providing practical guidance on how I4.0 technologies can support the full range of CE strategies. Using a literature review based on keywords’ clusters analysis, this study explores how I4.0 can support both implementation and decision-making in the CE 10Rs, providing a practical guide for businesses and supporting a broader shift towards sustainable business models. The results show that IoT, Big Data, and Digital Twins effectively support Rs related to smarter product use and manufacturing processes. Additive Manufacturing, Augmented/Virtual Reality, and Cognitive Twins are crucial in extending the lifespan of products or components. IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and human-robot collaboration can improve recycling practices and material recovery. The study reveals that while ’Reduce’ and ’Recycle’ dominate the literature, integrating I4.0 technologies with lesser-explored strategies like ’Reuse,’ ’Repurpose,’ ’Refurbish,’ and ’Remanufacture’ offers significant potential for future research. It also stresses the need to assess the energy and environmental impacts of I4.0 technologies themselves in the CE context.

AB  - In recent years, autonomous electric vehicles (A-EVs) have attracted the attention of academia and industry. In urban mobility, this topology requires consensus to control behaviours under swarm robotics. Although several model-based solutions have successfully enhanced accuracy and overcome some limitations, specific technological, methodological, and security issues remain. In this study, we systematically reviewed existing research related to swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems in urban mobility. Based on the obtained results, we propose a new directed acyclic graph-based multilayer architecture model. Furthermore, we propose a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model to make predictions. To validate the model, available data based on real traffic in Madrid (Spain) were considered.

AB  - The rapid accumulation of end-of-life tires, driven by global vehicle use, presents severe environmental challenges. Each year, approximately 3 billion tires are produced globally, with 800 million reaching end-of-life, of which 41% are landfilled without material or energy recovery. Pyrolysis has emerged as a sustainable solution, converting waste tires into valuable by-products, including pyrolysis oil, gas, and recovered carbon black (rCB). This bibliometric review analyzes 1,431 publications (2000–2024) sourced from Scopus to map research trends, advancements, and gaps in tire pyrolysis. Three primary research hotspots are identified: (1) co-pyrolysis, emphasizing feedstock optimization and microwave-assisted methods to enhance efficiency and product quality, (2) pyrolysis oil, addressing challenges in upgrading for industrial use, and (3) recovered carbon black (rCB), focusing on advanced demineralization and activation techniques to improve its properties. Key challenges identified include feedstock variability, catalytic system optimization, and process scalability. This review provides insights and a strategic framework for advancing tire pyrolysis, fostering sustainable practices, and driving innovation across energy, materials, and environmental applications.

AB  - Effective cleaning plays a critical role in reducing healthcare-associated infections. In recent years, built environment interventions in healthcare facilities have gained attention for their potential to enhance cleaning practices. Among these, contact surface materials serve as interfaces between the healthcare environment and its users. Emerging evidence from microbiological studies has demonstrated a clear link between environmental cleaning, surface material characteristics, and infection transmission. This review synthesizes findings from 70 studies to explore the intricate relationship between surface material characteristics and designing for cleaning efficacy. This study explores how material characteristics like porosity, texture, and durability affect cleaning ease and disinfectant performance within healthcare environments. The scope of the review includes mechanical cleaning, chemical disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hydrogen peroxide, as well as UV disinfection. The results of this review underscore the importance of optimized disinfection strategies based on surface characteristics and microbial resistance. Findings suggest, smooth, nonporous surfaces and finishes allow for more effective cleaning compared to porous and textured surfaces, which may trap contaminants and limit disinfectant penetration. Additionally, the disinfectant choice must consider the material's susceptibility to degradation or discoloration over time, as well as safety concerns for users. This literature-based analysis reveals important relationships between surface material characteristics and effective cleaning methods. These findings offer valuable insights for selecting appropriate interior materials and developing optimal sanitation protocols in healthcare settings.

AB  - Background
Emerging evidence suggests pharmacy-based point-of-care (POC) testing for acute respiratory infectious diseases is beneficial, but not widely implemented. A theory-informed review to understand the factors influencing service Implementation is lacking.
Objective
To examine the extent, range, and nature of research available on enablers and barriers to POC testing Implementation for infectious respiratory diseases in community pharmacies and identify their underpinning theoretical constructs using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).
Methods
Scoping review guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. A comprehensive search from inception to June 28th, 2022 was conducted using Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest dissertations without date or language restriction. Eligible articles investigated barriers and/or facilitators to strep throat, influenza, C-reactive protein, and COVID-19 POC testing in community pharmacies. Two reviewers independently performed title & abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction. Content analysis was conducted according to a pre-established Framework and concepts were mapped to the CFIR.
Results
Forty-three studies were included. Most originated from the USA (n = 24; 56%) and investigated strep throat. The majority were testing/initial Implementation projects (n = 23; 54%) conducted in urban centers (n = 17; 40%). Thirty-six (84%) studies used quantitative methodology, while 6 (14%) were qualitative. Only four studies (9%) used theory to guide their inquiry. The 124 identified Implementation factors mapped onto 21 CFIR constructs, covering all 5 domains. The domain “Outer setting” (n = 35/43; 81%) was most prevalent as were the constructs “Patient needs and resources,” (n = 21/43; 49%) “External policy & incentives,” (n = 17/43; 40%) and “Relative advantage” (n = 17/43; 40%).
Conclusion
A large volume of research explores factors influencing the Implementation of pharmacy-based respiratory infectious disease POC testing services, but few studies use qualitative or theory-informed methods. Knowledge of the wide range of facilitators and barriers identified can help pharmacy managers and researchers design strategies to support successful service Implementation.

AB  - Approaches to Automatic Text Summarization try to extract key information from one or more input texts and generate summaries whilst preserving content meaning. These strategies are separated into two groups, Extractive and Abstractive, which differ in their work. The extractive summarization extracts sentences from the document text directly, whereas the abstractive summarization creates a summary by interpreting the text and rewriting sentences, often with new words. It is important to assess and confirm how similar a summary is to the original text independently of the particular TS algorithm adopted. The literature proposes various metrics and scores for evaluating text summarization results, and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation) is the most used. In this study, our main objective is to evaluate how the ROUGE metric performs when applied to both Extractive and Abstractive summarization algorithms. We aim to understand its effectiveness and reliability as an independent and unbiased metric in assessing the quality of summaries generated by these different approaches. We conducted a first experiment to compare the metric efficiency (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L) for evaluating Abstractive (word2vec, doc2vec, and glove) versus Extractive Text Summarization algorithms (textRank, lsa, luhn, lexRank), and a second one to compare the obtained score for two different summary approaches: a simple execution of a summarization algorithm versus a multiple execution of different algorithms on the same text. Based on our study, evaluating the ROUGE metric for Abstractive and Extractive algorithms revealed that it reaches similar results for the Abstractive and Extractive algorithms. Moreover, our findings indicate that multiple executions, based on the running of two text summarization algorithms sequentially on the same text, generally outperform single executions of a single text summarization algorithm.

AB  - Rapid population expansion has led to a corresponding rise in the demand for sustenance. Researchers have found that traditional agricultural practices are insufficient to meet the demands of commodities, and their inefficiency poses the most pressing obstacle to addressing the growing global food demand. Precision agriculture (PA) is an advanced hierarchy farming system supported by multidisciplinary technologies such as specialized sensors, communication protocols, algorithms, and management tools, helping mitigate the problems of conventional farming by ensuring maximum production and minimum wastage. Given the rapid evolution of the aforementioned multidisciplinary technologies, this review paper analyzed 24337 research documents from 1938 to April 2024 using bibliographical software from the Scopus dataset. Internet of Things (IoT), Agriculture Robots (AR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are currently driving ongoing research, with frequency occurrences of 12.245, 8.259, and 7.791, highlighting the trend towards interconnected farming systems and data-driven automated systems. Bibliographical evidence indicates the current utilization of AI, AR, and IoT for accurate assessments like crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection, and soil analysis. Additionally, China is the most productive country in terms of publication, while the United States leads in terms of patents. This review paper also explores emerging trends that could guide future research, including blockchain technology, big data analysis, computing paradigms, and drone technology. Subsequently, a PA framework has been suggested to facilitate innovation in this field, followed by the open issues, highlighting the ongoing concerns related to insufficient infrastructure, integration, cost, and security measures, with the aim to engage all stakeholders.

AB  - Seawater desalination (SWD) can partially mitigate the increasing freshwater needs globally. Although, SWD is multifaceted and involves processes with environmental and economic challenges, research is often analyzed through Literature Reviews (LRs) in specific contexts that may miss general trends. Bibliometric Analyzes (BAs), however, provide researchers with an overview through Co-occurrence Networks (CNs), Strategic Diagrams (SDs), Thematic Subnetworks (TSs), and Thematic Evolution Diagrams (TEDs). Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy. Furthermore, RO remains the leading technique despite high energy demands. Solar desalination shows promise but faces cost and scalability challenges. Environmental and economic concerns are discussed, as well as emerging solutions regarding, solar desalination, blue energy, “blue carbon”, and zero liquid discharge. Research gaps include fouling effects and pretreatment incorporation in optimizations are also highlighted.

AB  - This comprehensive review examines the integration of Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Through systematic analysis of 11 key studies across multiple international databases, we evaluated various AI architectures, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks, applied to qEEG data for AD detection. The review encompasses studies with diverse subject populations, ranging from 35 to 890 participants, with mean ages between 66.94 and 74.8 years. Results demonstrate that AI-enhanced qEEG analysis achieves remarkable diagnostic accuracy, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) reaching 93.18% accuracy and 97.92% Area Under Curve (AUC). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) also showed promising results, with some models achieving up to 100% sensitivity in specific classifications. The integration of multiple data types and advanced feature extraction methods significantly improved diagnostic precision. Geographic diversity in research origins, spanning from Asia to Europe and the Americas, provides robust cross-cultural validation of findings. However, challenges persist in data quality, computational resources, and standardization of methodologies. This review highlights the significant potential of AI-enhanced qEEG as a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of AD in its prodromal and dementia stages, while also identifying areas requiring further research to optimize its clinical application. These findings suggest that AI-enhanced qEEG analysis could revolutionize AD diagnosis, enabling earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming popular in Additive Manufacturing (AM) due to their ability to create virtual replicas of physical components of AM machines, which helps in real-time production monitoring. Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes. Considering this opportunity, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DTs in AM by addressing the following four research questions: (1) What are the key types of DTs used in AM and their specific applications? (2) What are the recent developments and implementations of DTs? (3) How are DTs employed in process improvement and hybrid manufacturing? (4) How are DTs integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies? By discussing current applications and techniques, we aim to offer a better understanding and potential future research directions for researchers and practitioners in AM and DTs.

AB  - This review assessed the use of personal health records (PHRs) during and after disasters, identifying benefits, barriers, and contributions to their use. A literature search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted, focusing on articles examining PHR use during and after a disaster including a nuclear power plant accident. The study found that PHRs were commonly used in various disasters, often one month after the disaster. The objectives of their use included building new systems for disaster management and identifying problems during the disaster response. Barriers to PHR use included quality-related issues, such as data on regular quality maintenance, and cost factors for development and maintenance. PHRs were essential for identifying healthcare needs, managing patient care, tracking survivors, and collecting health data in the affected areas. Given the difficulty of establishing a new PHR system immediately after a disaster, PHRs should be integrated into existing systems before a disaster occurs. Integrating PHRs with national identification systems and including comprehensive health data have the potential to improve emergency medical intervention as well as general health status. In the future, PHRs may need to be able to engage users in healthcare during both normal and disaster times. However, several limitations exist in PHR use, including language barriers, and difficulties in obtaining patient consent for PHRs, which may limit the prevalence and effectiveness of PHRs themselves. Finding a balance between privacy and urgency regarding patient information is important to overcome the problems.

AB  - Sustainable consumption behavior (SCB) has gained increasing importance in addressing global challenges such as climate change and resource depletion. This paper presents a systematic review of theories and models applied to understanding SCB. A total of 64 studies, published between 2012 and 2022, were analyzed, utilizing 14 theories, models and subjects to identify key drivers of SCB. Among the theories, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was the most frequently employed, with 29 studies, highlighting the influence of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on sustainable consumption. Other prominent frameworks include Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), used in 5 studies, and the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) Theory, applied in 4 studies. The review identified a trend toward expanding TPB to include factors such as altruism and environmental concern to better capture SCB's complexity. Moreover, models like the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (used in 4 studies) emphasize the role of innovation adoption in promoting sustainability. Key findings also suggest that while internal motivations (e.g., personal values, attitudes) strongly influence SCB, external factors like social norms and policy interventions also play a crucial role. A notable challenge is the gap between intention and actual behavior, with several studies emphasizing the need for multi-dimensional approaches that integrate psychological, social, and contextual factors. This review consolidates diverse approaches into a guiding framework for future SCB studies, emphasizing the importance of contextual nuances and interdisciplinary collaboration to foster sustainable consumer behaviors across various domains.

AB  - Aims
Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) may represent the reference dietary pattern for athletes. Our aim was to study whether MedDiet could be associated with any changes in performance in adult athletes practicing different types of sport at various levels of competition.
Data synthesis
A systematic literature review (PROSPERO n. CRD42023459039) was performed based on the PRISMA method. The search was conducted in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library in October 2024. Competitive/elite healthy adult athletes performing at least 6 h/week. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2.0 Cochrane tool for randomised-controlled trials, Robins-I tool for non-randomised studies and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for the observational studies. A meta-analysis was conducted. 9 studies were included in this review (192 participants, mainly males), 5 of them had a cross-sectional design. The sample size ranged from 10 to 43 athletes performing different sports. 5 studies reported an impact of MedDiet on athletic performance; of these, 4 studies reported a positive effect. MedDiet adherence was positively related to anaerobic/aerobic power, explosive strength, and indirectly associated with body fat percentage. Reported adherence to MedDiet varied from low to high. The meta-analysis showed no MedDiet effect on the performance outcomes [SMD 0.00 (CI -0.26; 0.25)].
Conclusions
The findings of this review suggest a general positive influence of the MedDiet on athletic performance, supporting its role as a beneficial dietary pattern for athletes. Quantitative analysis did not confirm these results, probably due to the few studies included, their heterogeneity and low-to-moderate quality.

AB  - SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, predominantly caused by recurrence, underscoring the need for novel biomarkers for early detection of relapse. We hypothesize that patients’ response to cancer is closely linked to metabolic changes and can be detected in blood as an indicator for recurrence. Full metabolomics analysis was performed on the longitudinal samples collected from 160 CRC patients before and after surgery for 24 months or more. Key blood metabolic biomarkers that distinguish relapse and non-relapse patients were identified, and a minimal residual disease (MRD) detection machine-learning model was constructed based on the discovered signatures. The model diagnosed CRC relapse with a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 80%, with median and maximum lead days of 471 and 1056 days before diagnosed clinical relapse, suggesting it could be used as a novel diagnostic tool for earlier detection of cancer relapse.

AB  - Mosquitoes can carry and spread many diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. All these mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) represent a significant global burden of infectious diseases, including morbidity and mortality. This systematic review delves into the multifaceted factors contributing to the spread of MBD in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Following PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed peer-reviewed English-language observational and experimental studies published between May 1990 and January 2023, focusing on the interaction between population, environmental, disease, and mosquito factors in MBD. The review includes 32 studies (30 articles) that revealed a complex relationship between various risk factors and the presence of MBD. The review distinguishes between seroprevalence studies, which assess exposure to infection in asymptomatic populations, and overt disease studies, which focus on symptomatic cases and the host-specific factors that affect disease severity. It identifies key risk factors such as age, geography, gender, professional occupation, and socio-economic status, noting their varying impacts on disease transmission and progression across different MBDs. Environmental factors such as climate, mosquito breeding habitats, and urbanization are also reported as significant drivers of vector distribution and human-vector interactions. The review emphasizes the need for tailored, region-specific interventions to control MBD in the MENA region and highlights the importance of integrated vector control, improved sanitation, surveillance programmes, and public health education. The review also stresses the growing influence of climate change on disease patterns and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to MBD control. While focusing on the MENA region, the findings suggest the need for further research and region-specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

AB  - Due to the rising prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), it is increasingly crucial to identify eco-friendly ways to eliminate ARB from water-based media. The objectives of this review was to evaluates degradation studies and mechanisms of photocatalysis (PC), sonocatalysis (SC), and sonophotocatalysis (SPC), emphasizing how SPC overcomes individual limitations through synergistic effects. It also explores the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), piezoelectric enhancement, catalyst modifications (e.g., doping, heterojunctions). Additionally, it highlights key process optimization factors such as reactor design, light source, ultrasonic power, catalyst dosage, pH, and bacterial structure. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Scopus core collection database focusing on ARB removal methods such as SC, PC, and SPC from water-based media, within the timeframe of 2014 to 2024. Around 2975 studies were obtained through a Scopus-based database search with a total of 75 studies within the defined outline. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed research studies that investigated SC, PC, SPC for ARB/ARG degradation in aqueous media. Book chapters, conference abstracts, and studies lacking experimental validation were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed qualitatively based on study design and methodological transparency. SPC was found to significantly enhance degradation performance by increasing ROS generation and reducing electron-hole recombination. Performance was further improved through catalyst modifications optimized operational parameters, and piezoelectric effects. However, studies showed variability in catalyst stability and reusability. Most included studies were laboratory-scale with limited large scale application. Heterogeneity in methodology, catalyst types, and ARB strains limited quantitative synthesis. This review highlights future research directions on understanding the fate of ARB in water, emphasizing the challenges and opportunities in scaling up SPC for sustainable large-scale environmental management.

AB  - In practical object detection computer vision applications, training commonly incorporates multiple data sources. Domain adaptation enhances the models’ capacity to generalize across different source and target domain data. Active learning, which serves as a bridge between unsupervised and supervised domain adaptation, is an area that has been underexplored for object detection. Our methods are specifically designed to tackle the challenges of selecting target domain images for annotation, complementing the existing source domain images. First, this paper formally describes active learning in domain adaptation for object detection. We propose three new selection strategies for active learning in domain adaptation for object detection. We utilize multiple machine learning models when selecting target domain data for annotation. In particular, our best-performing selection method utilizes a domain discriminator to predict the target domain likelihood of each sample. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework that evaluates per-box and per-image labeling efforts in the unique object detection application. Through extensive experiments we could show that our best-performing method could improve the active learning object detection performance over random selection by about 2.4% while requiring about 13% less annotated bounding boxes on the target domain.

AB  - Indoor air pollution has emerged as a critical concern in recent years, significantly affecting human health, comfort and wellbeing. As individuals spend approximately 80–90% of their time indoors, the quality of indoor environments plays a pivotal role in shaping health outcomes and overall comfort. The prevalence of health concerns like Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) highlights the critical necessity for efficient indoor air quality (IAQ) management techniques. The use of botanical biofilters is identified as a cost-effective and energy-efficient method for reducing indoor gaseous pollution. This review analyses the current research regarding the influence of indoor plants on air quality, methodology for pollution assessment and the health effects of indoor pollutants. The pollutant-removal efficacy of various plant species, particularly in tropical ecosystems is also examined. The results support the investigation of multi-pollutant systems to improve indoor environmental quality. By synthesizing current knowledge, this review contributes to the development of plant-based filtration systems and informs sustainable building strategies that integrate energy-efficient and health-promoting design elements towards fostering healthier and more sustainable indoor spaces.

We systematically searched multiple electronic databases from inception to July 15, 2024 for studies exploring the links between employer hiring attitudes and decisions related to people living with psychosis. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on pooled studies which measured different but related outcomes concerning employer attitudes and behaviors towards hiring individuals with psychosis.
Results
A total of 10 studies with 4080 total participants were included in the systematic review which consistently found that employers view individuals with psychosis as less employable compared to those with other health conditions or no disabilities. Meta-analysis of 6 studies which met inclusion criteria pooling a total of 4315 assessments of potential employees living with psychosis revealed a statistically significant medium to large pooled effect size (Hedges g) of 0.57 (95 % CI [0.21 to 0.94], p = 0.010), indicating statistically significant discrimination. Subgroup analysis estimated that 76.00 % (95 % CI [62.90 % to 89.09 %], p < 0.001) of employers expressed negative attitudes towards hiring individuals with psychosis.
Conclusions
This first meta-analysis on the topic reveals statistically significant (p = 0.010) employer discrimination towards individuals with psychosis. Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address misconceptions and promote inclusive hiring practices. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating strategies to reduce workplace stigma and improve employment outcomes for people living with psychosis.

AB  - This paper explores advanced music generation through hybrid models combining deep neural networks, machine learning algorithms, variational autoencoders (VAEs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers to create diverse and engaging musical experiences. Our research aims to advance the understanding of music’s impact on our lives and develop methodologies to create diverse and engaging musical experiences tailored to individual preferences. We begin by extracting relevant features from a large and diverse collection of music samples from different genres. These features, encompassing spectral properties, rhythmic patterns, and tonal characteristics, serve as the foundation for our generation models. To generate music, we explore the potential of VAEs, LSTMs, and Transformers, each offering unique capabilities for handling different aspects of the task. VAEs are employed to learn a continuous latent space representation of the music samples, enabling the generation of novel compositions within a specified genre. LSTMs and Transformers, on the other hand, are used to model the temporal dependencies and intricate patterns inherent in music. While not claiming state-of-the-art performance, our approach demonstrates promising outcomes in generation tasks, showcasing its potential to enhance music-related applications such as recommendation systems and creative tools for composers.

AB  - The transformer is primarily used in the field of natural language processing. Recently, it has been adopted and shows promise in the computer vision (CV) field. Medical image analysis (MIA), as a critical branch of CV, also greatly benefits from this state-of-the-art technique. In this review, we first recap the core component of the transformer, the attention mechanism, and the detailed structures of the transformer. After that, we depict the recent progress of the transformer in the field of MIA. We organize the applications in a sequence of different tasks, including classification, segmentation, captioning, registration, detection, enhancement, localization, and synthesis. The mainstream classification and segmentation tasks are further divided into eleven medical image modalities. A large number of experiments studied in this review illustrate that the transformer-based method outperforms existing methods through comparisons with multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future opportunities in this field. This task-modality review with the latest contents, detailed information, and comprehensive comparison may greatly benefit the broad MIA community.

AB  - Integrating heat pumps and adopting building envelope retrofit (BER) measures is vital for decarbonising the built environment. This paper systematically reviews modelling approaches for these technologies within 84 local energy system optimisation studies. Our findings show that most studies simplify heat pump operation using a constant coefficient of performance (COP), perfect modulation, or a fixed heating capacity. While existing methods account for temperature-dependent COPs, only a few studies include more advanced approaches considering additional impacts. Two main approaches for modelling BER measures are identified: pre-defined retrofit sets with exogenous heat demand or an integrated retrofit selection with endogenous heat demand. While the pre-defined approach offers lower computational effort, it limits the BER solution space. The integrated approach achieves the opposite: a wider solution space but higher complexity. Moreover, only two studies consider the impact of BER measures on the heat supply temperature, an essential link between retrofit measures and heat pump efficiency. Based on our qualitative review, we derive recommendations for energy system modellers. For modelling heat pumps, we recommend using a temperature-dependent COP and heating capacity, as well as a lower modulation limit. Regarding BER measures, the integrated approach should be used for smaller scales (single buildings) while the pre-defined sets are suitable for larger scales. Finally, we propose a research agenda to address limitations and gaps in the current modelling approaches, such as addressing the performance gap between existing COP estimations and heat pump field performance and including a more detailed method for the heat supply temperature.

We analyzed 283 Scopus-indexed publications from 2014 to 2024 using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and Python-based libraries. The results show an annual publication growth rate of 18.15%. Cornell University, the University of Glasgow, and Delft University of Technology emerged as leading institutional contributors. National leadership was dominated by the United States, Germany, and China.Thematic mapping identified key areas such as autonomous vehicle validation, pedestrian-AV interaction, AI-driven traffic simulation, immersive driver training, and AR navigation for rail and maritime transport. Keyword analysis emphasized research focuses including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Vehicles, Pedestrian Safety, Mixed Reality, Traffic Simulation, and Human Factors.Despite this progress, significant challenges persist. Studies often lack ecological validity, demographic diversity, scalability, cybersecurity resilience, and ethical transparency. Most XR applications remain confined to laboratory settings with limited real-world validation or cross-cultural generalizability.To address these gaps, we propose integrated frameworks and a strategic research agenda. We emphasize ecological realism, cognitive-adaptive XR designs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical governance.This study consolidates existing knowledge and outlines future research directions. XR is positioned as a transformative and human-centered technology, crucial for advancing safer, smarter, and more inclusive transportation ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction
This systematic review explores the impact of Tin (Sn) filtration on radiation dose and image quality improvement in CT.
Methods
Using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework, the research question was developed: How does the application of Sn filtration as part of an optimisation strategy affect clinical outcomes related to radiation dose and image quality? MeSH search terms derived from this question were input into five databases: PUBMED, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central, and ProQuest Health & Medical Collection. Studies were independently screened by three experts using PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria focused on adult clinical studies using Sn filtration in non-contrast CT scans alongside iterative reconstruction (IR). Risk of bias was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool.
Results
A final 39 studies were included for evaluation. Sn with IR was used to optimise scanning in 10 different types of CT examinations. The use of Sn with IR resulted in a significant dose reduction (20–95 %) across all examinations. Most studies did not compare Sn with IR optimised examinations against standard examinations (without Sn) using a consistent, pre-set noise level, and reported an increase in image noise.
Conclusion
Sn is an effective dose reduction strategy for non-contrast CT examinations, but its limitations in terms of objective image quality warrant careful consideration by adjusting the IR level. Further studies are needed to confirm this approach.
Implications for practice
The findings support broader consideration of Sn filtration beyond its current use in a single CT vendor. However, wider adoption may face barriers such as vendor-specific hardware limitations, cost, and the need for training and protocol optimisation in clinical practice.

AB  - The literature on Industrial Symbiosis (IS) is rich in frameworks, methods, and tools for assessing sustainable impacts as a strategy for implementing a circular economy. However, a structured overview of integrating sustainability assessment methodologies with the IS life cycle to pursue sustainable development is lacking. This paper aims to build a knowledge base on sustainability assessment methodologies along the IS life cycle through a conceptual framework as a tool to achieve sustainable development. For this purpose, a systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, allowing the selection of 105 cases, which were subjected to descriptive and content analysis. From this analysis, we characterized the IS cases considering the levels of the circular economy, the R-imperatives, the origin and governance configuration of the IS, and the sustainable assessment methods within the IS life cycle stages. The analysis revealed the use of 54 distinct methodologies to assess the three dimensions of sustainability, which were classified in 12 clusters and integrated in a conceptual framework considering the IS life cycle phases (identification, assessment, implementation, and monitoring). The framework enables researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to identify sustainable assessment methodologies, the specific sustainability dimensions being assessed, and the corresponding stage of the IS life cycle. This approach is designed to address key internal and external factors of symbiotic networks, enabling the proposal of effective policies, the provision of financial incentives, and the facilitation of knowledge sharing. Ultimately, this will foster real synergies within the industrial ecosystem, resulting in tangible sustainability benefits for businesses, the environment, and society. Future research is needed on sustainability assessment methodologies to support the implementation and monitoring phases to facilitate the implementation of successful IS cases.

AB  - Summary
Thousands of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel variants contribute to a variety of disorders, including epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and pain disorders. Yet, the effects of more variants remain unclear. The conventional gain-of-function (GoF) or loss-of-function (LoF) classifications are frequently employed to interpret mutations’ effects and guide therapy for sodium channelopathies. Our study challenges this binary classification by analyzing 525 mutations associated with 34 diseases across 366 electrophysiology studies, revealing that diseases with similar GoF/LoF effects can stem from unique molecular mechanisms. Utilizing UniProt data, we mapped over 2,400 disease-associated missense mutations across Nav channels. This analysis pinpoints key mutation hotspots and maps patterns of gating-property impacts for the mutations, respectively, located around the selectivity filter, activation gate, fast inactivation region, and voltage-sensing domains. This study shows great potential to enhance prediction accuracy for mutational effects based on the structural context, paving the way for targeted drug design in precision medicine.

AB  - The growing demand for lightweight, flexible, and environmentally sustainable materials for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding has intensified the interest in cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based composites. Unlike conventional metal-based shielding materials, CNFs provide a biodegradable and mechanically robust platform capable of structural tailoring and strong interfacial interactions when combined with conductive fillers, such as MXene, AgNWs, PEDOT:PSS, and MWCNTs. This review critically evaluates 93 CNF-based composites tested in the X-band frequency range (8.2–14.2 GHz), focusing on how the microstructural design, filler configuration, and interfacial synergy govern four key performance parameters: shielding effectiveness, electrical conductivity, Joule heating response, and tensile strength. The analysis revealed that achieving high EMI shielding performance is not solely dependent on electrical conductivity, but rather on precise structural architectures, such as layered, gradient, or biomimetic designs, and robust interfacial bonding. Several systems demonstrate shielding effectiveness values exceeding 60 dB at film thicknesses below 0.05 mm, electrical conductivity above 104 S·cm−1, efficient Joule heating under low voltages (<3 V), and tensile strength exceeding 600 MPa. These findings reinforce the transformative role of CNF as an active structural component in optimizing multifunctional performance. In addition to summarizing recent technical achievements, this article outlines strategic future directions such as the integration of green synthesis methods, scalable fabrication strategies, and adaptive material designs for next-generation EMI shielding systems. Therefore, this review is essential as a comprehensive reference that bridges the gap between the fundamental understanding and practical applications of CNF-based materials, offering a scientific foundation for the development of sustainable, multifunctional, and application-ready EMI shielding solutions.

AB  - The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.

AB  - Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) encompasses a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign to malignant clonal B-cell proliferations. While MG is traditionally associated with hematologic malignancies, its role in autoimmune and rheumatologic diseases is increasingly recognized. This review proposes the novel concept of “monoclonal gammopathy of rheumatologic significance (MGRhS)” that refers to a non-malignant or pre-malignant systemic condition related to a monoclonal immunoglobulin and clonal B cells, capable of producing multi-organ damage or influencing the therapeutic management of rheumatologic diseases. MG of clinical significance is characterized by the production of monoclonal proteins causing organ damage and modulating immune responses. These proteins contribute to rheumatologic conditions or peculiar phenotypes, including cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjögren's disease, and other autoimmune disorders. The review explores pathogenic mechanisms linking MG with these diseases, emphasizing early detection and accurate classification to guide therapeutic strategies. The manuscript addresses the implications of incidental MG detection in rheumatologic patients, particularly in the context of biologic therapies. Practical guidance is provided on identifying MGRhS, assessing its impact, and tailoring management to prevent complications. This analysis aims to advance understanding of MGRhS as a distinct clinical entity, encouraging a multidisciplinary approach to its management. The integration of novel diagnostic tools and targeted therapies is essential to improve outcomes and address the complexity of this condition.

AB  - This study explores the development of biocompatible composites using strong basalt fibers and ductile silk fibers, and a polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. Five distinct stacking sequences were fabricated via a replicable hand layup and vacuum bagging technique, with alternating layer specimens (ALT) further enhanced by the addition of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) at 3, 6, and 9 wt.% of the PLA matrix. The composites were characterized for tensile, flexural, impact, and interlaminar shear strengths, damping properties, electrical conductivity, moisture absorption, and morphological features. The ALT configuration exhibited superior performance, with its multi-layered structure effectively mitigating delamination. ALT composites without GNPs achieved the highest tensile strength (136.54 MPa), tensile modulus (3.42 GPa), interlaminar shear strength (0.48 MPa), impact energy (36.84 kJ/m²), and flexural strength (18.06 MPa), predominantly failing via delamination. SEM analysis identified the basalt fiber-PLA interface as a critical failure site. The incorporation of 6 wt.% GNP enhanced damping by 1.54 times, but the composites remained nonconductive due to graphene agglomeration and lack of a conductive network. These energy-absorbing, environmentally sustainable composites show promise for multifaceted applications with reduced ecological impact.

AB  - National-level climate action plans are often formulated broadly. Spatially disaggregating these plans to individual municipalities can offer substantial benefits, such as enabling regional climate action strategies and for assessing the feasibility of national objectives. Numerous spatial disaggregation approaches can be found in the literature. This study reviews and categorizes these. The review is followed by a discussion of the relevant methods for the disaggregation of climate action plans. It is seen that methods employing proxy data, machine learning models, and geostatistical ones are the most relevant methods for the spatial disaggregation of national energy and climate plans. The analysis offers guidance for selecting appropriate methods based on factors such as data availability at the municipal level and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data. As the urgency of addressing climate change escalates, understanding the spatial aspects of national energy and climate strategies becomes increasingly important. This review will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and practitioners applying spatial disaggregation in this crucial field.

AB  - The purebred-crossbred genetic correlation (rpc) is a key parameter to determine whether the optimal selection of purebred animals to improve crossbred performance should rely on crossbred phenotypes, purebred phenotypes, or both. We reviewed published estimates of the rpc in poultry. In total, 19 studies were included, of which four were on broilers and 15 on laying hens, with 150 rpc estimates for nine different trait categories. Average reported rpc estimates were highest for egg weight, egg quality and egg colour (0.74–0.82), intermediate for BW, maturity and mortality (0.61–0.70) and egg number (0.58), and low for resilience (0.40) and body conformation (0.14). Most studies were based on measuring purebred and crossbred phenotypes in the same environment and thus did not capture the contribution of genotype by environment interactions to the rpc, suggesting that the presented average estimates may be higher than values that apply in practice. Nearly all studies were based on two-way crossbred animals. We hypothesised that rpc values for a two-way cross are good proxies for rpc of a four-way cross. Only eight out of 19 studies were published in the last 25 years, and only two of those used genomic data. We expect that more studies using genomic data may be published in the coming years, as the required data may be generated when implementing genomic selection for crossbred performance, which will lead to more accurate rpc estimates. Future studies that aim to estimate rpc are encouraged to capture the genotype by environment interaction component by housing purebred and crossbred animals differently as is done in practice. Moreover, there is a need for further studies that enable to explicitly estimate the magnitude of genotype by environment versus genotype by genotype interactions for multiple trait categories. Further, studies are advised to report: the specific housing conditions of the animals, any differences between measurements of purebred versus crossbred performance, and the heritabilities of purebred and crossbred performance.

AB  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool rapidly advancing the state-of-the-art in numerous domains. This paper conducts a comprehensive review to analyse the applications of GANs in the construction industry over the years, and the review aims to enrich the body of knowledge on this emerging Deep Learning (DL) algorithm in the construction sector. To achieve this, a comprehensive exploration of the variation in GANs is first conducted to establish a general foundation of knowledge. Subsequently, 76 publications from the year 2014 to 2023 are analysed to identify the growth and significance of the current research landscape in the construction field. The results of the study indicate that GANs are predominantly applied in four key construction domains, yet several limitations persist. This study serves as a crucial reference point for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders seeking to understand and harness the transformative power of GANs in construction.

AB  - Numerous applications are being developed to enhance the energy efficiency of building systems, including fault detection and diagnosis, performance assessment, and intelligent control. For these applications to be effectively utilised, a data connection between the real and virtual worlds must be established. One potential solution to establish this connection and enable semantic enrichment of data with metadata is the semantic digital twin. Semantic digital twins use semantic technologies, such as ontologies, as metadata schemas. However, creating these twins requires substantial manual effort due to the need to examine diverse sources of information about the building systems and normalise this information into a metadata schema. This review investigates whether metadata inference based on time series data from building systems can assist in the automated creation of semantic digital twins. To this end, 53 artificial intelligence-based publications on metadata inference are analyzed for their applicability and efficiency. Three key tasks of metadata inference are examined to create a semantic digital twin: type classification, relation inference, and extraction of operational information. Based on these findings, future research directions are proposed.

AB  - Multi-targeted drug therapy has received substantial attention for the treatment of diseases of multi-factorial origin, including neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. It seems reasonable to argue that the complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases (ND) cannot be reduced to a single target to modulate a broad range of cellular signaling, associated pathologies, and symptoms. It is this idea that has brought the attention of the scientific world towards phytochemicals and traditional drugs that are notoriously multi-targeted. A systematic study of these formulations and establishing the molecular pathways of individual molecules can lead to a standardized multi-component product that can modulate a broad range of activities on different targets of ND. This could provide an accessible and affordable solution to the significant disease burden of ND. With this idea in mind, a systematic review was carried out on an Ayurvedic product Manasamitra Vatakam (MMV), known to be a neuroprotective formulation and highly effective against Alzheimer's disease. MMV can be a source of phytomolecules for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The multifactorial nature of these diseases makes them suitable candidates for testing phytochemicals due to the inherent multitargeting capabilities of these compounds. The primary objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phytomolecules from MMV that are responsible for its multitargeted effect against neurodegenerative diseases. From the reported literature, it is clear that many phytoconstituents and extracts of the herbal ingredients from MMV have demonstrated their efficacy against AD models. However, the combination of these molecules in AD models has never been tested. Scientific studies should be done to explore the bioactive compounds in the formulation and the druggability of these identified compounds can be evaluated using experimental methods.

AB  - Background
Meditation, encompassing focussed attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) approaches, is recognised for its potential to enhance cognitive functions. Sustained attention, a critical component of attentional processes, influences cognitive capacity and is linked to meditation benefits. However, a robust and extensive review analysis needs to address the specific relationship between meditation and sustained attention in nonclinical populations.
Methods
Following PRISMA guidelines, the authors reviewed English articles published from 2013 to 2023 in Q1 SCOPUS-indexed journals. Inclusion criteria comprised original research studies exploring the impact of meditation on sustained attention in healthy individuals. The modified Jadad Scale assessed methodological quality.
Results
12 studies (four RCTs, eight non-RCTs) with 1447 participants were included. Concentrative or FA meditation demonstrated consistent positive effects on sustained attention, including reduced perceived stress and increased focussed attention. OM meditation significantly improved sustained attention, as evidenced by reduced mind wandering and enhanced N2 responses. Meditators consistently outperformed non-meditators in sustained attention tasks, demonstrating faster reactions and lower error rates.
Discussion
This review explored the impact of meditation on sustained attention across diverse non-clinical populations through 12 investigations involving 1447 subjects with meditation interventions spanning from 21 days to 3 months. The study revealed that both FA and OM meditation approaches positively impact sustained attention, highlighting their potential role in enhancing cognitive function. Meditators consistently exhibited superior sustained attention abilities, suggesting the cognitive benefits of regular meditation practice. The findings of this study are consistent with prior research, contributing to the growing body of knowledge on the advantageous impacts of meditation on sustained attention. However, caution is needed in generalizing findings due to study limitations. Future research should use standardized methodologies and conduct longer-term follow-ups to better elucidate the effects of meditation interventions on sustained attention across diverse populations.

AB  - This review paper delved into the economic and environmental benefits of Digital Agricultural Technological Solutions (DATSs) in livestock farming systems. Synthesising data from 52 peer-reviewed papers it presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review on livestock farming DATSs, conducted with the use of the PRISMA methodology. The analysis highlighted the contribution of DATSs across three main livestock farming DATSs categories: Automated Milking Systems (AMS), Feed and Live Weight Measurement technologies, and Health Monitoring Systems. The results showed that AMS has the potential to boost cow productivity by up to 15 % while also reducing energy consumption by 35 %. Feed and Live Weight Measurement technologies contribute notably to sustainability and cost savings, with feed waste reductions of 75 % and feeding savings of 33 %. Health Monitoring Systems are especially effective in improving herd health and productivity through early detection of clinical issues, which directly enhances animal welfare and farm efficiency. Environmentally, AMS and health monitoring tools play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with AMS lowering global warming potential by up to 5.83 %. Overall, the findings of this review highlight the potentials of livestock DATSs towards economic viability and environmental sustainability, suggesting that the wider adoption could offer substantial benefits for the livestock farming sector. Up to now, DATSs have shown great potential in dairy cattle by improving milk yield, quality, and animal health, with advancements such as AMS increasing productivity and health monitoring systems enhancing early disease detection. In contrast, their application in sheep, goats, and pigs is still in its early stages, mainly limited to basic health monitoring and feeding technologies, despite the economic importance of these species, especially in the Mediterranean area, where most of the studies are conducted.

AB  - Background
Exercise is a common intervention for low back pain, but its effect sizes are small to modest. Social risk factors significantly influence health outcomes, yet their consideration in randomized controlled trials on exercise for low back pain is often neglected. Determining their relationship to outcomes may provide better insight into exercise effectiveness.
Objectives
To assess the reporting of social risk factors (SRFs) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise interventions for low back pain (LBP) in adults and explore associations between SRFs and outcomes.
Design
Scoping Review.
Methods
The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane were searched for studies published between January 2014 to March 2025. RCTs were included if exercise was the primary intervention for LBP treatment and had a minimum follow-up of 12 weeks. A planned analysis of SRF and outcome associations was not conducted due to insufficient data.
Results
A total of 10,292 studies were identified and 157 studies included. Fewer than half (47.1 %) reported any SRFs at baseline. Socioeconomic position (42.7 %) was most frequently reported, followed by social relationships (17.8 %), race/ethnicity/cultural context (8.3 %), residential/community context (1.3 %), and gender (0.6 %). Four studies incorporated SRFs in their outcome analyses; one examined associations with outcomes and found no significant association.
Conclusion
SRFs are underreported in RCTs of exercise interventions for LBP and are rarely analyzed in relation to primary outcomes, limiting our understanding of their impact. Future trials should prioritize collecting and reporting SRFs at baseline and incorporating them in outcome analyses to assess their influence on outcomes.

AB  - The World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is impacted by land-based pollutants, largely but not only from agriculture. We review evidence of the barriers and drivers for landholders to adopt better management practices and explore how adoption rates can be improved in the GBR catchments. A total of thirty primary studies was identified from Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Several adoption factors are identified, including economic returns, risk and uncertainty, transaction costs, and trust. While the studies provide a comprehensive list of the factors that might be important, they are not very helpful in identifying what should be done. We suggest that more attention should be paid to adoption processes rather than just focusing on the factors that drive or inhibit practice change. To guide this, we group the various adoption factors into four overarching constructs: financial, risks, personal norms and social norms, placing much more attention on the role of norms in adoption than other frameworks have. It is the combination of constructs that encourages adoption. We recommend that programs not only focus on financial factors but also address risks, as well as personal and social norms, as these approach are more likely to succeed.

AB  - In e-commerce, online reviews play a vital role in understanding customer requirements. Companies can perform analysis of these reviews to make right business decisions. However, manually analyzing the content generated by each user on social media is challenging due to its high volume and frequency. Sentiment analysis (SA) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique which provides an automated solution to this problem. It is a challenging subtask of text classification. Over a long time, researchers have proposed different approaches to solve it. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning approach using transformer architecture to perform SA on women’s clothing e-commerce dataset which is imbalanced in nature. In this study, we have fine-tuned DistilBERT, a cutting-edge transformer based pre-trained model and developed models for two subtasks of SA named as Sentiment Classification (SC) and Product Recommendation (PR). The proposed models have achieved the highest F1 scores (0.79 for SC and 0.85 for PR), AUC scores (0.98 for SC and 0.96 for PR) along with the highest accuracy of 0.96 for SC and 0.91 for PR. We found that the performance of our models is least affected by imbalanced dataset issues. The results show that the proposed models have significantly outperformed the traditional supervised approaches and various other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. This study can contribute to a better understanding of consumer sentiment and consumer psychology in the e-commerce transaction business.
