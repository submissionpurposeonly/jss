AB  - The organic fraction of municipal solid waste is mainly composed of food waste (FW), and traditional disposal practices for this fraction are generally considered to have negative environmental and economic impacts. However, the organic characteristics of this fraction could also be exploited through the anaerobic digestion of FW (FW-AD), which represents unique advantages, including the reduction of the area required for final disposal and environmental pollution and the same time the generation of renewable energy (mainly methane gas), and a by-product for agricultural use (digestate) due to its high nutrient content. Although approximately 88% of the world's population resides in areas with temperatures below 8 °C, psychrophilic conditions (temperatures below 20 °C) have hardly been studied, while mesophilic (66%) and thermophilic (27%) ranges were found to be more common than psychrophilic FW-AD (7%). The latter condition could decrease microbial activity and organic matter removal, which could affect biogas production and even make AD unfeasible. To improve the efficiency of the psychrophilic FW-AD process, there are strategies such as: measurement of physical properties as particle size, rheological characteristics (viscosity, consistency index and substrate behavior index), density and humidity, bioaugmentation and co-digestion with other substrates, use of inocula with psychrophilic methanogenic communities, reactor heating and modification of reactor configurations. However, these variables have hardly been studied in the context of psychrophilic conditions and future research should focus on evaluating the influence of these variables on FW-AD under psychrophilic conditions. Through a bibliometric analysis, this paper has described and analyzed the FW-AD process, with a focus on the psychrophilic conditions (<20 °C) so as to identify advances and future research trends, as well as determine strategies toward improving the anaerobic process under low temperature conditions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted several institutions to offer free, dedicated websites and tools to foster research and access to urgently needed innovative solutions by facilitating the search and analysis of information within the large amount of scientific and patent literature which was published since January 2020. This situation is clearly exceptional and challenging for patent information users searching for relevant disclosures at a given date in a reliable manner. This article provides an overview of search criteria and strategies, main databases and websites, number of publications, biological sequence information and experimental data sets covering COVID-19 findings within scientific and patent literature have been disclosed between January and August 2020. The analysis of non-patent literature has been focused on the identification, date assignment, disambiguation, and access to experimental data. The analysis of patent literature has been focused on the trends found within the earliest filed and published patent documents in representative jurisdictions worldwide. Some practical advice and strategies for technical, medical, or patentability assessment of COVID-19-related innovations across different information formats and resources are proposed.

AB  - Recent statistical and social studies have shown that social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter contain valuable data that influence human behaviors. This data can be used to track, fight, and control the spread of the COVID-19 and are an excellent asset for analyzing and understanding people’s sentiments. Current levels of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination are still insufficient to achieve immunity standards as stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The present study employs bibliometric analysis to uncover trends and research into sentiment analysis and COVID-19 vaccination. A range of analyses is conducted using the open-source tool VOSviewer and Scopus database from 2020-2021 to acquire a deeper insight and evaluate current research trends on COVID-19 vaccines. The quantitative methodology used generates various bibliometric network visualizations and trends as a function of publication metrics such as citation, geographical attributes, journal publications, and research institutions. Results of network visualization revealed that understanding the the-state-of-the-art in applying sentiment analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to local government health agencies and healthcare providers to help in neutralizing the infodemic and improve vaccine acceptance.

AB  - The rise of emerging mobility services (EMS), particularly ridehailing and micromobility, has transformed urban transportation and challenged the traditional public transit (PT) system. This has led to coopetition dynamics between EMS and PT, characterized by supplementary, complementary, and competitive interactions, which introduce complexity to discussions on equity, cost, and sustainability. The long-term impact will also depend on how EMS is integrated with existing PT and how cities manage these challenges. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a systematic literature review of EMS and PT coopetition dynamics, focusing on the equity implications of accessibility. The findings reveal that ridehailing primarily competes with PT while complementing it during disruptions and in areas with limited service; however, it disproportionately benefits affluent areas, exacerbating inequities. Conversely, micromobility supplements PT as first- and last-mile solutions while also competing in city centers. This study also offers topology and pathways from coopetition to equitable EMS and PT integration.

AB  - This article presents a systematic review of scientific publications on the ecosystem services topic with an integrated approach in Latin American countries for the period 1992–2017. Ecosystem services were subdivided into functional (provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural) and thematic (biodiversity, hydrological, carbon capture, landscape, soil) classifications to demonstrate their mutual interconnection. An integrated approach was assumed when ecological, social, economic, and political dimensions converged within studies. As a methodological procedure, the sequence of the PRISMA protocol and a semantic network analysis were conducted to select and review scientific articles from two international scientific databases. The articles were characterized according their evolution over time, geographical location and predetermined analysis variables. The results highlight that the most frequently analyzed services were provisioning and regulating ecosystem services related to hydrological and biodiversity. The timeline showed an increasing number of integrated studies since 2009, with most case studies developed at regional and local scales for forest and fishing socioecological systems in Brazil, Mexico and Costa Rica. The studies were predominantly multidisciplinary, with clear public policy demand and governmental funding. Transdisciplinary studies have the potential to build plural and inclusive knowledge to improve the decision-making process and offer support for solutions to complex socio-environmental problems.

AB  - Purpose
A large number of systematic reviews (SRs) studies have been performed in the cloud computing field, demonstrating miscellaneous outcomes and utilizing different approaches. Accordingly, a meta-review of cloud SRs is needed to appraise the results of such studies and create an integrated understanding. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
Design/methodology/approach
A tertiary study was conducted using a systematic method to analyze SRs including two stages: searching and screening the SRs and thematic synthesis of results. As a qualitative data management tool, Nvivo software was used to support the research process, for data coding and synthesis.
Findings
First, by searching electronic sources between the year of 2011–2016, out of a total of 142 identified articles, 94 articles were included according to pre-determined criteria, of which 76 articles were approved after qualitative evaluation. In the second stage, identifying the research themes, a map of the concepts and issues related to each theme was drawn up. The analysis shows that the quality of articles has improved but can be further enhanced using methodological guidelines as well as supporting tools. The research has focused more on the technical aspect, although there is an equal demand for synthesizing of cloud governance concepts.
Originality/value
This is the first tertiary study which presents the main research themes and concepts of cloud SRs in form of thematic maps by using the thematic synthesis and SR methods. This paper also provides some recommendations to improve reviews after evaluating the quality of papers. This study can support reviewers for future SRs in the field and also helps practitioners and managers to have a better understanding of different aspects of cloud computing.

AB  - What are the links between mainstream climate science and local community knowledge? This study takes the example of Greenland, considered one of the regions most impacted by climate change, and Inuit people, characterized as being highly adaptive to environmental change, to explore this question. The study is based on 10 years of anthropological participatory research in Uummannaq, Northwest Greenland, along with two fieldwork periods in October 2014 and April 2015, and a quantitative bibliometric analysis of the international literature on sea ice – a central subject of concern identified by Uummannaq community members during the fieldwork periods. Community members' perceptions of currently available scientific climate knowledge were also collected during the fieldwork. This was done to determine if community members consider available scientific knowledge salient and if it covers issues they consider relevant. The bibliometric analysis of the sea ice literature provided additional insight into the degree to which scientific knowledge about climate change provides information relevant for the community. Our results contribute to the ongoing debate on the missing connections between community worldviews, cultural values, livelihood needs, interests and climate science. Our results show that more scientific research efforts should consider local-level needs in order to produce local-scale knowledge that is more salient, credible and legitimate for communities experiencing climate change. In Uummannaq, as in many Inuit communities with similar conditions, more research should be done on sea ice thickness in winter and in areas through which local populations travel. This paper supports the growing evidence that whenever possible, climate change research should focus on environmental features that matter to communities, at temporal and spatial scales relevant to them, in order to foster community adaptations to change. We recommend such research be connected to and co-constructed with local communities to ensure their needs and values are integrated into the research process and outputs.

AB  - Although the number of aspect-oriented software development techniques and tools proposed by the scientific literature have been increasing since the late 80′s, the evidence about the benefits that the aspect-oriented paradigm have reached in real-world settings is scarce. Our objective is to identify and classify the aspect-oriented software development methodologies used to reduce the effort and costs of moving from traditional approaches to the aspect-oriented approach in real-world settings. We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 3212 papers out of which 115 were selected as relevant studies. We defined eight categories to classify these studies: aspect-oriented methodologies proposed for early aspects; development early phases covered; notations; modeling techniques; supporting tools; aspect-oriented methodologies used in real-world settings; benefits reported and unsolved issues. As a result, 39 named methodologies were reported; they cover the business modeling (14 papers), requirements (93 papers), test cases (1 paper) and design (41 papers) phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC); we found 36 different notations, with UML as the most mentioned (66 papers); 22 modeling techniques were found, where the use cases were the ones that appeared the most, on 43 occasions; 43 support tools of which none was repeated in more than 3 articles; 15 applications in real-world settings; 17 benefits, modularization being the most mentioned with 4 occurrences; and 15 pending improvement opportunities. Finally, we have obtained conclusions: the literature analyzed demonstrates that there are no prevailing standards on methodologies and notations, beyond that the most employed are those belonging to the OMG; we have not found any methodology that includes all phases of the SDLC; the diagrams corresponding to OMG’s standards account for 78% of the results in the facet of modeling techniques; there are no tools that have the greatest predilection and the most used is mentioned only three times; in addition, 41% of the articles do not mention any tool; the evidence of aspect-oriented methodologies application in real-world settings reached just the 10%, although the declared benefits are coincident with those promised in the aspect-orientated literature. The mentioned pending issues can guide new studies (RQ8).

KW  - Tertiary systematic review
AB  - Refactoring and smells have been well researched by the software-engineering research community these past decades. Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support. In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018. We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work. Thus, we want to highlight the gap between code smells and refactoring in the current state of software-engineering research. We wish that this work could help the software-engineering research community in collaborating on future work on code smells and refactoring.

AB  - The application of the “Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (and Respective Capabilities)” (CBDR-RC) principle in the field of biodiversity received criticisms due to the lack of scientific evidence and/or outdated categories which in turn resulted in a knowledge gap in its applicability in policy-making. Reflecting on this research gap, we reviewed existing relevant publications by quantifying and evaluating the responsibility of different countries under various categories (i.e., low-, middle-, and high-income) for biodiversity loss. As concrete indicators, we used the five direct drivers of biodiversity loss by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to examine and identify biodiversity-related footprints and challenges, whereby the applicability of the CBDR principle was considered. Data on the national impact and positive contributions to global biodiversity were also encompassed, considering all available data from older periods as possible. The results showed that low-, middle-, and high-income countries contributed to biodiversity loss, with high-income countries as the largest contributor, indicating relatively high responsibility by developed countries. Meanwhile, developing (middle- and low-income) countries contributed about 44% of biodiversity loss. The results further indicated that the shared responsibility was not clear enough to be sorted out by a simple dichotomy between developed and developing countries and immediately applying the CBDR principle. Besides, the impact of global trade should be fairly attributed to consumer countries (frequently developed countries) and producer countries (developing countries). Moreover, the upward move in the income category in many countries in the last decades has not been fully reflected in discussions under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This means that the respective capabilities have not been considered in a timely manner in policy-making. As such, we propose non-binary “Differentiated But Shared Responsibilities (and Updated Capabilities)” (DBSR-UC) as a new concept, highlighting the need for incentives and burdens based on scientific evidence.

AB  - During the franchisee recruitment process, franchisors and franchisee candidates must both engage and screen each other to determine whether they are a suitable match. To facilitate this, they usually exchange a number of signals that reduce information asymmetry. Whilst several authors have attempted to examine the role of signals in the decision-making process, these studies have overlooked the evolution of signals over the recruitment process and the active role of both parties in reaching an informed decision. Building on a dynamic integrative view of signaling theory, our research aims to provide a more thorough understanding of the signaling strategies franchisors and franchisee candidates adopt during this process. We rely on data stemming from in-depth interviews with 29 franchisors and 34 franchisee candidates in the French market. Our findings challenge the literature on franchisee recruitment by showing how franchisors and candidates alike customize their signals and screen each other over the recruitment process in order to decide whether to contract based on their assessment of person-organization fit. Our research thus confirms the relevance of frameworks combining the latest developments in signaling theory and the person-organization fit perspective to examine contexts of information asymmetry, thereby opening new avenues for research in B2B settings. Additionally, our paper offers managerial implications for franchisors and franchisee candidates by helping them effectively send and interpret mutual signals to avoid adverse selection.

AB  - The need for constant upgradation in nanotechnology and their integration with health science and the pharmaceutical sector has escalated the key innovation in the field of theranostics to produce versatile and promising carbon-based nanomaterials called Nanodiamonds (NDs). Their unique physicochemical and therapeutic properties, biocompatibility, and multifunctionality make them a potent candidate for theranostic and other prominent applications. This comprehensive review of NDs and their biomedical therapeutic potential stands as the first instance to delve into their latest advancements in synthesis techniques, characterization, and smart functionalization for enhanced target-specific biomedical applications, highlighting their unique properties such as dual-function combining both therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities, anti-microbial activity, anti-oxidant, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Despite toxicity and large-scale clinical translation challenges, ongoing research on surface modifications and functionalization strategies is paving the way for safer and more effective biomedical applications of NDs. The applications of NDs in bioimaging, such as fluorescence imaging, provide high-resolution and precise diagnostic information, and optical and electrochemical biosensors contribute significantly to rapid diagnosis of the disease. This review also highlights the future prospects of NDs, underscoring the benefits of integrating ML and AI with NDs in advancing personalized medicine and enhancing clinical outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach bridging materials science, biology, and pharmaceutical sciences will be essential for the successful integration of NDs into clinical practice, unlocking their full potential in modern theranostics. NDs can revolutionize theranostic methodologies as research progresses, revealing avenues towards personalized therapies with better patient outcomes.

AB  - Objective
Vascular neurosurgery has developed significantly in Nigeria, but its burden and challenges remain unclear. This study systematically reviewed vascular neurosurgical literature from Nigeria.
Methods
Four research databases and gray literature sources were searched from 1962–2021. ROBINS-I tool was used to assess risk of bias. Descriptive, narrative, and statistical analyses were conducted on all variables. Where appropriate, paired t-tests and Chi-squared independence tests were used (α = 0.05).
Results
56 articles were included and 3203 patients pooled for analysis. Risk of bias was moderate-high. Most articles were published over the last 20 years with retrospective cohort studies and case reports being the most common study designs. The cohort had a relatively even gender split and an average age of 49 years (±22). Cerebrovascular accidents accounted for over 85% of diagnoses, with most etiologies being traumatic. Headache and motor deficit were the most prevalent clinical features. X-ray and carotid angiography were the most commonly reported imaging modalities, closely followed by computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography. The top two radiological diagnoses were ischemic cerebrovascular disease and intracerebral hematoma. Aneurysmal clipping and hematoma evacuation were the most commonly reported treatment modalities. Outcome at last follow-up was favorable in 48%. The mortality rate was 6%. Post-treatment complications included chest infection and rebleeding.
Conclusions
This study illustrates the epidemiological burden of neurovascular pathology (based on the available data in published literature) in Nigeria, and raises awareness amongst service providers and researchers of the attendant challenges and epochal trends seen within vascular neurosurgery in Nigeria.

KW  - Thematic analysis
AB  - Purpose
In recent times, several instances of anti-immigration-related hate crimes and religious bullying have been reported where South Asian expatriates have been victimized. The accompanying children of such expatriates may find such hostile perceptions very difficult to deal with due to their tender age and sensitive ego, which may also lead to the premature return of the expatriate. In this study, a qualitative investigation is conducted to understand the specific problems faced by South Asian expat kids with respect to religious stigma and anti-immigration sentiments.
Design/methodology/approach
A latent thematic analysis was adopted as the research method in this study. Responses were obtained from 27 South Asian adolescent expat kids through audiovisual interviews.
Findings
A total of three central themes were identified from the analysis: (1) coping against social stigma, (2) dealing with social isolation and (3) assimilating with host culture. The findings indicated that the expat kids from South Asia were mentally well prepared to cope with bullying related to the religious or political sentiment using several self-reflective orientations and through optimal use of technical resources.
Research limitations/implications
This study applies a qualitative exploratory design. Hence, a follow-up study backed by quantifiable data is needed to enhance generalizability of the findings.
Practical implications
Corporate practitioners may develop dedicated social media page for expat kids or an online community of such individuals as a support system.
Originality/value
The paper applies a critical lens on some deep-rooted sociopolitical issues which have not been addressed in extant literature on expat adjustment.

AB  - Context: Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a standard data-centric publish–subscribe programming model and specification for distributed systems. DDS has been applied for the development of high performance distributed systems such as in the defense, finance, automotive, and simulation domains. Various papers have been written on the application of DDS, however, there has been no attempt to systematically review and categorize the identified obstacles. Objective: The overall objective of this paper is to identify the state of the art of DDS, and describe the main lessons learned and obstacles in applying DDS. In addition, we aim to identify the important open research issues. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted by a multiphase study selection process using the published literature since the introduction of DDS in 2003. Results: We reviewed 468 papers that are discovered using a well-planned review protocol, and 34 of them were assessed as primary studies related to our research questions. Conclusions: We have identified 11 basic categories for describing the identified obstacles and the corresponding research challenges that can be used to depict the state-of-the-art in DDS and provide a vision for further research.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is seen as a structural solution to society's sustainability problems. But with a large diversity of definitions, CE is also often portrayed as immature or in need of conceptual synthesis. Rather than treating the bemoaned ambiguity as a problem, in this article we analyse its implications on CE practice at the example of meetings aimed at popularising CE to businesspeople. To this end, we build on a grounded theory approach to analyse ethnographic and participant observations of CE meetings in Sweden from a performativity perspective. We identify four major communication norms that are enabled by ambiguity in the observed meetings, and simultaneously manage and maintain this ambiguity. The communication norms consist of implicit standards for how people ought to act, talk, respond, and reflect in the meetings. We contribute to CE scholarship by showing how ambiguity is not a sign of failure or immaturity, but an integral and productive part of CE discourse, as it enables diverse actors to congregate around shared aims. Our findings may help CE practitioners and scholars to make explicit the ambiguity of the CE concept in meetings, and ultimately to navigate in debates about what society and economy we want to live in.

AB  - Quest is a fully integrated Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project that started CO2 injection in August of 2015. The Quest CCS Project is located near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. It includes a capture facility which uses a Shell amine technology, a pipeline of about 65 km length, and three injection well pads. Each injection well pad has an injection well, a deep monitoring well, and shallow groundwater wells. The storage complex is geologically defined by the injection reservoir, a deep saline aquifer called the Basal Cambrian Sand (BCS) (about 45 m thick) and several seals, including the Middle Cambrian Shale (about 50 m thick) and Lotsberg Salts (about 120 m thick). As of August 2018, over three million tonnes of CO2 have been safely injected and permanently stored in the BCS. The Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (CCIR) requires the use of standard methods of quantification for reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for facilities with over 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year. An emission offset project is required to comply with CCIR, associated standards and protocols, to demonstrate a reduction in the specified gas emissions and, in the case of Quest, geological sequestration. Quest is the first CCS project to implement an offset project in the context of commercial scale on-shore CO2 geological sequestration within a saline aquifer. Quest uses the Quantification Protocol for CO2 Capture and Permanent Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers, from Alberta Environment and Parks. An offset project must develop an offset project plan (OPP) which demonstrates how the project meets the requirement of the protocol, describes how GHG emissions reductions are achieved, identifies risks associated with the quantification of emission reduction benefits, and describes methodologies used to quantify sources and sinks. Subsequent to completing the OPP, an offset project will put together offset project reports (OPR) to report on the net reductions of GHG emissions for a specific period. The intent of this paper is a) to provide an overview of the OPP and OPR for the Quest CCS project, and b) to discuss learnings from the initial compilation and submission of offset project reports. The key learning at this time is associated to the equipment improvements to the injection gas online analyzer.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) are rapidly becoming an important facet in the drive for attaining sustainable energy goals. However, EV sales still constitute only a small proportion of vehicles in most countries. The expansion of DC fast-charging network will facilitate a sustainable transportation revolution by offering end-user a versatile choice to charge EVs for longer journeys. Power converters play a significant role in the design and operation of EV charging stations. Modern technologies in charging stations are promising, where state-of-the-art research allows idle batteries or EVs to operate as distributed energy sources. However, it is always important to ensure input current harmonics and power factors are within the standard specification. Solid-state switch-mode power converters have reached a level of maturity with regards to the improvement in power quality and precisely regulating voltage levels during bidirectional power flow operation. This paper presents an exposition of EV charging systems, including incentives for development, structures, power converters, standards, industrial applications, and emerging trends. Furthermore, state-of-the-art technologies, including both academic and real-world EV charging technologies, have been carefully chosen, and a quantitative assessment of the technologies has been provided in this paper.

AB  - The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) has heavily relied on ex post, reactive tools. This approach has proven inadequate, as numerous foreseeable problems arising out of commercial development and applications of AI have harmed vulnerable persons and communities, with few (and sometimes no) opportunities for recourse. Worse problems are highly likely in the future. By requiring quality control measures before AI is deployed, an ex ante approach would often mitigate and sometimes entirely prevent injuries that AI causes or contributes to. Licensing is an important tool of ex ante regulation, and should be applied in many high-risk domains of AI. Indeed, policymakers and even some leading AI developers and vendors are calling for licensure in the area. To substantiate licensing proposals, this article specifies optimal terms of licensure for AI necessary to justify its use. Given both documented and potential harms arising out of high-risk AI systems, licensing agencies should require firms to demonstrate that their AI meets clear requirements for security, non-discrimination, accuracy, appropriateness, and correctability before being deployed. Under this ex ante model of regulation, AI developers would bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their technology is not discriminatory, not manipulative, not unfair, not inaccurate, and not illegitimate in its lawful bases and purposes. While the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can provide key benchmarks here for ex post regulation, the proposed AI Act (AIA) offers a first regulatory attempt towards an ex ante licensure regime in high-risk areas, but it should be strengthened through an expansion of its scope and substantive content and through greater transparency of the ex ante justification process.

AB  - Identification of stakeholder needs and documentation of software requirements are the critical steps to launch a software project. Natural language requirements serve as an agreement among the project stakeholders and they must be transformed into easy-to-understand conceptual models to avoid communication problems. Although conceptual models are mostly created manually with human involvement from the software team, it is seen in recent times that there is a significant increase in studies that automatically generate conceptual models from software requirements. In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based on the search of forty-four primary studies (published between 1996 and 2020), which automatically transform software requirements into conceptual models, is reported. These studies are evaluated regarding their approaches, functionalities, dataset used, evaluation methods, generated model types, and languages supported. Finally, several improvable points in the current approaches are highlighted and suggestions are provided as further works.

AB  - In part 1 we identified a coupling between death spikes and birth dips that occurs following catastrophic events such as influenza pandemics and earthquakes. Here we seek to characterize some of the key features of this effect. We introduce a transfer function defined as the amplitude of the birth trough (the output) divided by the amplitude of the death spike (the input). It has two salient features: (i) it is always smaller than one so is an attenuation factor and (ii) as a function of the amplitude of the death spike, it is a power law with exponent close to unity. Since many countries do not publish monthly data, merely annual data, we attempt to extend the analysis to cover such data and how to identify the death–birth coupling. Finally, we compare the responses to unexpected death spikes and those to recurrent seasonal death peaks, such as winter death peaks.

AB  - This review critically updates the state of the art on the uncertainties associated with reanalysis data directly used for wind resource assessment. Performances were analysed from 15 (9 global and 6 regional) reanalysis products applied on 322 very heterogeneous locations worldwide. Reanalysis scores were assessed by location type (offshore, coastal, inland and mountainous) and height above the ground (10–300 m). The results confirmed that reanalyses can predict wind resource pattern over time, while they are not similarly able over space. Reanalysis data (particularly by ERA5) are sufficiently reliable on offshore and flat onshore locations. Uncertainties are greater on mountainous and coastal sites, where wind speed and energy yield are significantly under- and over-estimated, respectively. On these locations, the use of higher-resolution regional products should be preferred over global datasets as they are better suited to resolving detailed terrain features as well as roughness and topographical discontinuities. Comparison between older and newer reanalysis versions revealed that the latter do not always outperform the former. In many cases, however, improvements by the newer products were found – rather than in accuracy itself – in pushing a given accuracy towards higher elevations, thus more suitably meeting the needs of modern wind power industry. In perspective, it is desirable that advances in forecasting models will enable current problems in assimilating surface land wind observations by global reanalyses to be overcome. Refinements in global datasets could also positively reflect on regional products.

AB  - Objective
To describe survival trends and global patterns of esophageal cancer (EC) using survival data from population-based cancer registries.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SEER, and SinoMed databases for articles published up to 31 December 2023. Eligible EC survival estimates were evaluated according to country or region, period, sex, age group, pathology, and disease stage.
Results
After 2010, Jordan exhibited the highest age-standardized 5-year relative survival rates (RSRs)/net survival rates (NSRs) at 41.1% between 2010 and 2014, while India had the lowest, at 4.1%. Survival rates generally improved with diagnostic age across most countries, with significant increases in South Korea and China, of 12.7% and 10.5% between 2000 and 2017, respectively. Survival was higher among women compared to men, ranging from 0.4%–10.9%. Survival rates for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were similar, differing by about 4%. In China, the highest age-standardized RSRs/NSRs was 33.4% between 2015 and 2017. Meanwhile, the lowest was 5.3%, in Qidong (Jiangsu province) between 1992–1996.
Conclusion
Global EC survival rates have improved significantly in recent decades, but substantial geographical, sex, and age disparities still exist. In Asia, squamous cell carcinoma demonstrated superior survival rates compared to adenocarcinoma, while the opposite trend was observed in Western countries. Future research should clarify the prognostic factors influencing EC survival and tailor prevention and screening strategies to the changing EC survival patterns.

AB  - This paper conducts performance assessment from integrated resilience engineering (IRE) and lean production points of view. This is the first study that evaluates the impact of integrated resilience engineering (IRE) on lean production principles. Second, this study considers integrated impact of lean production by a unique intelligent algorithm. The proposed algorithm is composed of radial basis function (RBF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Moreover, the algorithm is capable of handling both crisp and fuzzy data due to the existence of intelligent approach. The proposed algorithm is equipped with verification and validation mechanism through conventional regression, statistical methods and data envelopment analysis. To demonstrate the applicability of the study, a real-world pipe manufacturer is considered as our case study. The results showed that “pull system” and “fault tolerant” among lean and IRE factors, respectively have been implemented inappropriately, while other factors are either suitably executed or ineffective.

AB  - Background
Melanoma is one of the most life-threatening skin cancers; immune checkpoint blockade is widely used in the treatment of melanoma because of its remarkable efficacy.
Objective
This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research conducted in recent decades on immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma, while exploring research trends and public interest in this topic.
Methods
We summarized the articles in the Web of Science Core Collection on immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma in each year from 1999 to 2020. The R package bibliometrix was used for data extraction and visualization of the distribution of publication year and the top 10 core authors. Keyword citation burst analysis and cocitation networks were calculated with CiteSpace. A Gunn online world map was used to evaluate distribution by country and region. Ranking was performed using the Standard Competition Ranking method. Coauthorship analysis and co-occurrence were analyzed and visualized with VOSviewer.
Results
After removing duplicates, a total of 9169 publications were included. The distribution of publications by year showed that the number of publications rose sharply from 2015 onwards and either reached a peak in 2020 or has yet to reach a peak. The geographical distribution indicated that there was a large gap between the number of publications in the United States and other countries. The coauthorship analysis showed that the 149 top institutions were grouped into 8 clusters, each covering approximately a single country, suggesting that international cooperation among institutions should be strengthened. The core author extraction revealed changes in the most prolific authors. The keyword analysis revealed clustering and top citation bursts. The cocitation analysis of references from 2010 to 2020 revealed the number of citations and the centrality of the top articles.
Conclusions
This study revealed trends in research and public interest in immune checkpoint blockade for melanoma. Our findings suggest that the field is growing rapidly, has several core authors, and that the United States is taking the lead position. Moreover, cooperation between countries should be strengthened, and future research hot spots might focus on deeper exploration of drug mechanisms, prediction of treatment efficacy, prediction of adverse events, and new modes of administration, such as combination therapy, which may pave the way for further research.

AB  - Existing scales for Service Innovation focused mostly on technological newness in firms where the non-technological components were ignored. This study emphasizes the need for measures that could include both technological and non-technological constructs from customer perspective across a range of sectors. Mixed Method approach was adopted where qualitative techniques like in-depth interview, focus group discussion were used for item generation and purification followed by quantitative tests like PCA, EFA and path analysis to establish the item validation. A 22 items scale named INNOSERV with seven major typologies that measure service innovation was developed. Theoretically this study helps in emphasizing the importance of considering non-technological innovation to be viewed while measuring performance by the service industry. Managerially, the scale could be adopted by the service industry in understanding how their customers perceive or diffuse their innovation activity. For society, this scale organization understands that non-technological innovation also plays a major role in contributing to economic, social and environmental sustainability. This study highlights the need for exclusive approaches, theories and measurement tools which are essential to be defined in the service sector.

AB  - Today’s digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.

AB  - Background
Mast cells (MCs) play a critical role in many allergic and inflammatory reactions in healthy and disease states. Current therapeutic strategies to treat MC-mediated diseases aim to suppress MC activation by utilizing small molecule inhibitors or antibodies targeting specific signaling receptors on MCs. However, these strategies require chronic drug exposure, which have inherent limitations including increased patient burden and potential toxicity. Moreover, the redundancy between multiple signaling pathways concomitantly regulating MC activation can lead to insufficient MC suppression.
Objective
To develop a novel therapeutic strategy using an aglycosylated anti-KIT monoclonal antibody, briquilimab, to deplete MCs via KIT signaling inhibition.
Methods
Inhibition of KIT by briquilimab was evaluated in vitro in KIT expressing cell lines and primary human MCs. Briquilimab safety, pharmacokinetics, and MC depletion were evaluated in non-human primates (NHPs).
Results
Briquilimab potently blocks SCF ligand binding to KIT and inhibits SCF/KIT signaling and primary MC degranulation and survival, leading to MC apoptosis via PI3K/AKT pathway in vitro. Additionally, aglycosylation of briquilimab mitigates unwanted MC activation. In NHPs, single and multi-dose high, chronic exposure of briquilimab is well-tolerated with mild to moderate, but reversible adverse effects and effectively depletes various tissue MCs, such as lung, skin, and colon, in a dose-dependent manner.
Conclusions
Briquilimab effectively inhibits SCF/KIT signaling and induces MC apoptosis, leading to profound and durable MC depletion in NHPs, and may provide a safe and novel therapeutic option to treat MC-mediated diseases.

AB  - In recent years, machine-learning-based approaches have become of considerable interest to the efficient processing of short or limited data samples. Its so-called small data approach. This is due to the significant growth of new intellectual analysis tasks in various industries, which are characterized by limited historical data. These include Materials Science, Economics, Medicine, and so on. An effective processing of short datasets is especially acute in medicine. Insufficient number of vectors, significant gaps in the data collected during the supervision of patient’s treatment or rehabilitation, reduces the effectiveness or prevents effective intellectual analysis based on them. This paper presents a new approach to processing short medical data samples. The basis of the developed method is SVR with RBF kernel. The algorithmic implementation of the method in both operation modes is described. Experimental modeling on a real short data set (Trabecular bone data) is conducted. It contained only 35 observations. A comparison of the method with a number of existing machine learning methods is conducted. It is experimental established the highest accuracy of the method among those considered. The developed method has potential opportunities for wide application in various fields of medicine.

AB  - The widespread adoption of cloud technology in the healthcare industry has achieved effective outcomes in sharing health records and sensitive data. In recent years, many organizations have prioritized E-Health as their primary goal for advancement in health services. As a result, Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) has emerged as a reliable model for health information exchange across cloud settings. Eventually, it leads to provide acceptable solutions for challenging scenarios like fine-grained accesscontrol. Despite ABE significance and its breadth of applications, no systematic and comprehensive survey exists in the literature that covers every variation of ABE in healthcare, highlighting its past and present status. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive study of ABE works concerning E-Health as the authors rigorously investigate healthcare-focused ABE frameworks and examine them based on various descriptive criteria, along with categorizing them systematically in 10 distinct domains and sub-domains, ultimately offering observations and potential recommendations. The descriptive research design, significant findings along with the suggested future works will help future research in ABE to secure the existing E-Health data sharing more effectively. The present study will also facilitate researchers and practitioners to comprehend the past trends and current state of ABE architectures in secure health data-sharing scenarios, as well as the prospect of ABE deployment in most recent technological evolutions.

AB  - Background & Aims
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition increasingly associated with gut microbiota alterations. Among microbial metabolites, p-Cresol has emerged as a potential contributor to the pathophysiology of ASD. This systematic review aims to examine the evidence linking p-Cresol and its metabolites with ASD and explore their potential role within the gut–brain axis framework, a bidirectional communication system where gut microbiota influence brain function via immune, metabolic, and neural pathways (e.g., vagus nerve, microbial metabolites).
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane up to March 2025, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies were included if they quantified p-Cresol or its derivatives in biological samples from individuals with ASD. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. The protocol was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251007080).
Results
Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most reported elevated urinary or fecal p-Cresol levels in individuals with ASD compared to controls, with consistent associations found between p-Cresol concentrations and (1); gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly constipation and diarrhea; (2) specific microbiota alterations including increased Clostridium difficile and Desulfovibrio abundance; and (3) behavioral manifestations and ASD severity. However, heterogeneity in study designs, small sample sizes, and variability in analytical techniques limit the generalizability of the results.
Conclusion
p-Cresol and its microbial precursors may contribute to ASD pathophysiology through gut–brain axis interactions. Although current evidence supports this association, further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm causality and evaluate p-Cresol as a biomarker or therapeutic target in ASD.

We performed a systematic mapping for answering questions related with domains, approaches, solution types, variability, test case automation, artifacts, and evaluation. We built a roadmap from 44 selected studies. Main obtained results are: Software and Automotive domains are most considered; Black-box testing is widely performed; most studies have fully-automated support; variability is considered in most studies; Finite State Machines is the most used model to test SPLs; Behavioral-based and Scenario-based are the most used models; Case Studies and Experiments are used to evaluate MBT solutions and the majority is performed in industrial environments; traceability is not widely explored for MBT solutions. Furthermore, we provide a roadmap synthesizing studies based on used models, more formal artifacts, supporting tools, variability management, (semi-)automation, and traceability. The roadmap contributes to identify related primary studies based on given artifacts, variability management, tools, automation, and traceability techniques and to identify, from a given primary study, which artifacts, tools, variability management, automation and traceability techniques are related. Therefore, the roadmap serves as a guide to researchers and practitioners on how to model-based test SPLs.

AB  - Electric motors account for over 53% of global electricity consumption, making their energy efficiency relevant for climate change mitigation and for a more competitive industry. However, more efficient motors often require more materials. Despite this, research primarily focuses on motors' energy efficiency during usage, neglecting other life cycle phase like manufacturing and disposal. This study conducted a Systematic Literature Review, identifying 1112 publications on the topic, with only 20 deemed relevant. Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM) were dominant due to their cost, reliability, and efficiency. However, over the past 30 years, efficiency has improved largely due to altered material use. This impacts production and disposal phases but lessens the use phase impact. Alternatives like Switched Reluctance Motors (SRM) provide better energy efficiency with fewer materials compared to SCIM. Permanent Magnet Synchronous Electric Motors (PMSM) emerge as the most energy efficient but with high environmental impacts in production and disposal. Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRM) are competitive SCIM alternatives, boasting less vol/wt, higher efficiency, and reduced impacts. The analyzed Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) showed variations in included life cycle phases, materials accounted for, and impact categorization. Thus, a tiered framework for electric motor LCAs is recommended. The use phase has the most significant impact, accounting for over 90% of life cycle impacts. Efficient motors generally have reduced environmental effects over their lifespan, even if their production and disposal impacts are higher. Notably, all analyzed LCA publications are European, so findings might vary in other regions. The study concludes by highlighting seven research gaps to further reduce electric motors' environmental impacts.

AB  - Context:
Machine learning is a valuable tool in software engineering allowing fair defect prediction capabilities at a relatively small expense. However, although the practical usage of machine learning in defect prediction has been studied over many years, there is not sufficient systematic effort to analyse its potential for business application.
Objective:
The following systematic mapping study aims to analyse the current state-of-the-art in terms of machine learning software defect prediction modelling and to identify and classify the emerging new trends. Notably, the analysis is done from a business perspective, evaluating the opportunities to adopt the latest techniques and methods in commercial settings to improve software quality and lower the cost of development life cycle.
Method:
We created a broad search universe to answer our research questions, performing an automated query through the Scopus database to identify relevant primary studies. Next, we evaluated all found studies using a classification scheme to map the extent of business adoption of machine learning software defect prediction based on the keywords used in the publications. Additionally, we use PRISMA 2020 guideline to validate reporting.
Results:
After the application of the selection criteria, the remaining 742 primary studies included in Scopus until February 23, 2022 were mapped to classify and structure the research area. The results confirm that the usage of commercial datasets is significantly smaller than the established datasets from NASA and open-source projects. However, we have also found meaningful emerging trends considering business needs in analysed studies.
Conclusions:
There is still a considerable amount of work to fully internalise business applicability in the field. Performed analysis has shown that purely academic considerations dominate in published research; however, there are also traces of in vivo results becoming more available. Notably, the created maps offer insight into future machine learning software defect prediction research opportunities.

This paper presents a concept of a Case-Based Reasoning system to automate the implementation process, based on the assumption that similar assembly tasks have similar solutions as used as heuristics in the current manual procedure. For retrieving similar cases a digital description of the assembly task and a method to measure the similarity is introduced. The retrieved cases are then used to warmstart a Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. The approach is evaluated on two simulated robot task.

AB  - This chapter presents how standards in additive manufacturing (AM) can support the regulation and certification of medical devices and implants made by these technologies. There are some specific issues of AM technologies such as anisotropy, multi-material, graded material, process parameters, etc., which need to be addressed to ensure the final quality of the product. The chapter shows how standards in additive manufacturing are developed by international bodies (ASTM, ISO, CEN), and how the medical field requires specific standards. There are some gaps in the existing international regulations for medical devices/implants (MD/I) when this digital manufacturing is involved, for example, the issue of custom-made product /mass production. Future needs and priorities of standardization of AM for MD/I are proposed to fill the existing gap.

AB  - Objective
Access to neuro-oncologic care in Nigeria has grown exponentially since the first reported cases in the mid-1960s. In this systematic review and pooled analysis, we characterize the growth of neurosurgical oncology in Nigeria and build a reference paper to direct efforts to expand this field.
Methods
We performed an initial literature search of several article databases and gray literature sources. We included and subsequently screened articles published between 1962 and 2021. Several variables were extracted from each study, including the affiliated hospital, the number of patients treated, patient sex, tumor pathology, the types of imaging modalities used for diagnosis, and the interventions used for each individual. Change in these variables was assessed using Chi-squared independence tests and univariate linear regression when appropriate.
Results
A total of 147 studies were identified, corresponding to 5,760 patients. Over 4000 cases were reported in the past 2 decades from 21 different Nigerian institutions. The types of tumors reported have increased over time, with increasingly more patients being evaluated via computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is also a prevalent use of radiotherapy, though chemotherapy remains an underreported treatment modality.
Conclusions
This study highlights key trends regarding the prevalence and management of neuro-oncologic pathologies within Nigeria. Further studies are needed to continue to learn and guide the future growth of this field in Nigeria.

AB  - The valorization of biomass to produce biofuels has become a heavily investigated field due to the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental concerns. Among them, the research on deoxygenation of fatty acids or esters derived from biomass as well as municipal sludge organics to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons has become a hot topic. Fatty acid is a key intermediate derived from ester hydrolysis, therefore has attracted more attention as a model compound. In this review, we first introduce and compare the three reaction pathways of hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and decarbonylation, for the deoxygenation of fatty acids and esters. The preference of reaction pathway is closely related to the type of raw materials and catalysts as well as reaction conditions. The special purpose of this review is to summarize the dilemma and possible strategies for deoxygenation of fatty acids, which is expected to provide guidance for future exploration and concentrates. The atom utilization along with stability during reaction in a long time is the most important index for commercial economy. Herein, we propose that the rational design and delicate synthesis of stable single-atom non-noble catalysts may be the best solution. The ultimately goal is aiming to develop sustainable production of green diesel hydrocarbons.

AB  - Background
Redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for TAV failure is becoming increasingly common. Although short-term outcomes appear favorable, no post redo-TAVR imaging has been performed to evaluate the frame expansion and geometry.
Objective
We report our first-in-human experience of using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and fluoroscopy to evaluate valve frame expansion and geometry of both index and second TAV.
Methods
From 1/2023 to 4/2025, 30 out of 40 consecutive patients underwent redo-TAVR for bioprosthetic valve failure had evaluable postprocedural MDCT. Index TAV were pre-dilated 80% (24/30), and both TAV were post-dilated in all cases for frame optimization. Frame dimensions were measured by MDCT and fluoroscopy for both index and second TAV at different levels. Valve expansion and eccentricity were calculated by comparing observed measurements to expected nominal measurements validated from previous studies.
Results
TAV-in-TAV combinations were: 8/30 (26.7%) short-in-short, 16/30 (53.3%) short-in-tall (15 Evolut, 1 Navitor), and 6/30 (20%) tall-in-short. Structural valve deterioration was the common mechanism of failure. Both MDCT and fluoroscopy showed that index TAVs were all underexpanded and expansion was seen post redo-TAVR in all cases. The second TAVs were underexpanded across all valve types, but more so with tall-in-short (Evolut-in-Sapien) combination. No elevated valve gradients and no hypoattenuated leaflet thickening were observed at 30 days.
Conclusions
There was significant underexpansion of both index and second TAV after redo-TAVR, irrespective of valve type and combinations. Larger studies are needed to validate this finding and determine the longer-term impact of underexpansion of the second TAV, despite acceptable short-term hemodynamic performance.

KW  - NVivo analysis
AB  - Purpose
There is wide acknowledgment that training people from all levels of an organization in process management activities and “process thinking” is a major contributor to the success or failure, and sustainability of business process management (BPM). BPM training is provided in almost all BPM initiatives and involves the investment of valuable financial, human, information and other resources. However, little research has focused on this area. As a result, there is a lack of guidance for organizations in conducting value adding BPM training. The purpose of this paper is to consolidate the current published knowledge on BPM training in the form of a descriptive literature review to paint a picture of the existing work, identify gaps and propose a program of work for the future.
Design/methodology/approach
A structured descriptive literature review was conducted to understand the current status of literature on training in the domain of BPM. Of an initial search of 90 publications, 64 publications, published between 1994 and 2015, were filtered and reviewed based on their relevance to answer the research question: What has BPM literature mentioned of training people for BPM? This study proposes a research agenda based on this. A grounded theory coding approach was employed, where NVivo 10 was used as a tool to support the analysis.
Findings
A total of 234 codes (representing emerging themes) were inductively identified from the data. These codes were further analyzed, resulting in eight core themes pertaining to training in the BPM context.
Research limitations/implications
The paper presents a vivid descriptive overview of the current status of research in BPM training identifying gaps in the literature and presents a research agenda which supports a call for action.
Originality/value
The paper is the first known of its kind to compile the status of literature focused on BPM training and recommend a research agenda based on such.

AB  - Competition between companies, especially in the metalworking industry, has driven the continuous search for strategies that aim to reduce costs, improve product quality, and shorten delivery times. However, a persistent challenge that these industries face is delivery delays, caused by a number of complex factors, including supply chain issues, project management difficulties, technical and work issues. To address this issue, several approaches and methodologies have been adopted. On the one hand, agile management tools such as Scrum, Prince2 Agile, Lean Project Management, Agile Project Management and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) have been implemented to increase the flexibility and adaptability of production processes. On the other hand, classic analytical solutions, such as the Gantt/Waterfall Method, PMBOK Guide, Spiral Model, Prince2 and the Critical Path Method (CPM) and/or the PERT method, have been applied to ensure a clearer and more structured view of projects. In addition to these traditional approaches, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in project management. A detailed analysis of articles reveals a marked preference for Machine Learning (ML), with particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These AI techniques have been successfully applied in a variety of projects, especially in civil construction, helping to predict and mitigate delays, improve operational efficiency and optimize resource allocation. Despite the progress made, research on the use of AI in project management still faces significant challenges, as reflected in the scarcity of available studies on the topic in project management in the metalworking industry.

AB  - Purpose
Season of birth has been considered a proxy of seasonally varying exposures around perinatal period, potentially implicated in the etiology of several health outcomes, including malignancies.
Methods
Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we have systematically reviewed published literature on the association of birth seasonality with risk of central nervous system tumors in children and adults.
Results
Seventeen eligible studies using various methodologies were identified, encompassing 20,523 cases. Eight of 10 studies in children versus four of eight in adults showed some statistically significant associations between birth seasonality and central nervous system tumor or tumor subtype occurrence, pointing to a clustering of births mostly in fall and winter months, albeit no consistent pattern was identified by histologic subtype. A plethora of perinatal factors might underlie or confound the associations, such as variations in birth weight, maternal diet during pregnancy, perinatal vitamin D levels, pesticides, infectious agents, immune system maturity, and epigenetic modifications.
Conclusions
Inherent methodological weaknesses of to-date published individual investigations, including mainly underpowered size to explore the hypothesis by histological subtype, call for more elegant concerted actions using primary data of large datasets taking also into account the interplay between the potential underlying etiologic factors.

AB  - There is a markedly broad range of definitions and illustrative examples of the role played by governments themselves within the literature on government platforms. In response we conduct an inductive and deductive qualitative review of the literature to clarify this landscape and so to develop a typology of six definitions of government platforms, organised within three genres along a spectrum from fully centralised, through to fully decentralised. For each platform definition we offer illustrative ‘mini-cases’ drawn from the UK government experience as well as further insights and implications for each genre, drawn from the broader information systems literature on platforms. A range of benefits, risks, governance challenges, policy recommendations, and suggestions for further research are then identified and discussed.

This article seeks to develop a framework for MaaS analysis and present a panorama of MaaS initiatives in the Northern hemisphere as of 2021, in order to understand the practical meaning behind the MaaS concept. The analysis framework is based on a literature review of previous MaaS definitions and involves seven facets. The panorama of initiatives contains 30 implementations, of which 17 are out of Europe – from North America to Eastern Asia. From the characterization of the different initiatives, by conducting a cluster analysis, we derive a novel typology of MaaS initiatives in 6 categories.

AB  - Societal values are generally seen as leading to changes in human decisions and behavior, but have not been addressed adequately in current water management, which is blind to changes in the social drivers for, or societal responses to, management decisions. This paper describes the evolution of the societal value of water resources in Australia over a period of 169 years. These values were classified into two groups: those supporting economic development versus those supporting environmental sustainability. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper was used as the main data source to track the changes in the societal value of water resources. Content analysis was used to create a description of the evolution of these societal values. Mathematical regression analysis, in combination of transition theory, was used to determine the stages of transition of the societal value, and the co-evolved social-ecological framework was used to explain how the evolution of societal values interacted with water management policies and practices, and droughts. Key findings included that the transition of the societal value of water resources fitted the sigmoid curve – a conceptual S curve for the transition of social systems. Also, the transition of the societal value of water resources in Australia went through three stages: (1) pre-development (1900s–1962), when the societal value of water resources was dominated by economic development; (2) take-off (1963–1980), when the societal value of water resources reflected the increasing awareness of the environment due to the outbreak of pollution events; (3) acceleration (1981–2011), when the environment-oriented societal value of water resources combined with the Millennium Drought to trigger a package of policy initiatives and management practices focused on sustainable water resource use. The approach developed in this study provides a roadmap for the development of new disciplines across social and natural science.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Objective
This study evaluated different strategies of forage inclusion in finishing beef cattle diets and their ef- fects on feed intake, ruminal fermentation and microbiota, blood serum parameters, growth performance, carcass quality, and liver abscesses.
Materials and Methods
Steers (n = 360, 400 ± 29 kg) were stratified by weight and randomly allocated across 24 pens, which were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (15 steers/pen, 6 pens/treatment) in a completely randomized experiment. Treatments included: (1) positive control (+CTRL) fed a diet (7.5% forage on a diet DM basis) with tylosin (11 mg/kg); (2) negative control (−CTRL; control diet without tylosin); (3) a diet where forage concentration decreased (DECR) every 42 d and was static for the last 84 d (forage represented 15%, 9%, 3%, and 3% of DM, respectively) without tylosin; and (4) a diet where forage concentration increased (INCR), inverse of the DECR without tylosin.
Results and Discussion
The +CTRL steers had greater ADG (1.74 kg/d vs. 1.63 kg/d), shrunk total BW gain (306 vs. 287 kg), and a tendency for greater final BW (705 vs. 687 kg), than than INCR steers. As expected, a diet × period interaction was observed for DMI, but it did not differ among treatments over the full study. Yield scores and rib fat thickness were greater in –CTRL than INCR steers. The percentage of steers with minor liver abscesses tended to be less for +CTRL (51.8%) and DECR (51.8%) compared with −CTRL (62.2%) and INCR (64.3%).
Implications and Applications
Greater dietary con- centrations of forage earlier in the finishing phase, with a subsequent decline thereafter, has the potential to de- crease the proportion of minor liver abscesses similar to typical finishing diets including tylosin, without affecting growth performance or carcass quality.

AB  - Gynecological neuroendocrine neoplasms are rare entities and can be divided into two groups: carcinoids and neuroendocrine carcinomas. Due to their rarity their management is not standardized. The aim of this work is to summarize and discuss the current literature evidence on this pathology. A scoping literature review was performed in multiple databases. Thirty-one studies were included: 30 case reports and one case series. Patients’ age ranged between 28 and 92 years. Surgery was the most used treatment and the surgical approach included local excision (N = 16/31; 51.6%) with (N = 5/16; 31.25%) or without (N = 11/16; 68.75%) inguinal lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered in 12 (38.7%) cases; instead, platinum-based therapies were frequently used when chemotherapy was chosen for adjuvant treatment. The overall survival ranged between 20 days to 4 years. However, further research is needed; currently, multimodal approach including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy appeared safe and feasible for the treatment of these rare and aggressive diseases.

KW  - mobile phone
AB  - Background
Over the past 2 decades, various desktop and mobile telemedicine systems have been developed to support communication and care coordination among distributed medical teams. However, in the hands-busy care environment, such technologies could become cumbersome because they require medical professionals to manually operate them. Smart glasses have been gaining momentum because of their advantages in enabling hands-free operation and see-what-I-see video-based consultation. Previous research has tested this novel technology in different health care settings.
Objective
The aim of this study was to review how smart glasses were designed, used, and evaluated as a telemedicine tool to support distributed care coordination and communication, as well as highlight the potential benefits and limitations regarding medical professionals’ use of smart glasses in practice.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in 6 databases that cover research within both health care and computer science domains. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology to review articles. A total of 5865 articles were retrieved and screened by 3 researchers, with 21 (0.36%) articles included for in-depth analysis.
Results
All of the reviewed articles (21/21, 100%) used off-the-shelf smart glass device and videoconferencing software, which had a high level of technology readiness for real-world use and deployment in care settings. The common system features used and evaluated in these studies included video and audio streaming, annotation, augmented reality, and hands-free interactions. These studies focused on evaluating the technical feasibility, effectiveness, and user experience of smart glasses. Although the smart glass technology has demonstrated numerous benefits and high levels of user acceptance, the reviewed studies noted a variety of barriers to successful adoption of this novel technology in actual care settings, including technical limitations, human factors and ergonomics, privacy and security issues, and organizational challenges.
Conclusions
User-centered system design, improved hardware performance, and software reliability are needed to realize the potential of smart glasses. More research is needed to examine and evaluate medical professionals’ needs, preferences, and perceptions, as well as elucidate how smart glasses affect the clinical workflow in complex care environments. Our findings inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of smart glasses that will improve organizational and patient outcomes.

AB  - Mob programming is an emergent practice in the industry, attracting increasing attention from the research community. Superficially a simple concept – similar to pair programming, but with more people – many of the same concerns arise as with pair programming, only more so: can it truly be efficient, is it for everybody, and what are the benefits and risks involved? In this paper we show that while research interest in this topic is increasing, much of the published literature to date constitutes experience reports, with a number of implicit differences in how mob programming is practiced. To transform mob programming from an area of avant-garde experimentation into a well understood practice in the toolbox of mainstream software engineering, such implicit differences need to be exposed, analyzed and documented, and the contextual enabling factors must be investigated. In this paper we take an important step in that direction by identifying variations in the practice and providing concrete guidance for creating an organizational and social environment where mob programming can be practiced both effectively and safely.

AB  - In the rapidly evolving field of Omics research, computational tools play a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data generated by high-throughput technologies. However, with an ever-increasing number of tools available, it has become essential to evaluate their performance systematically. We present an overview of the systematic benchmarking of Omics computational tools. The methodology for benchmarking is discussed, including selecting representative tools, identifying benchmark datasets, and establishing performance metrics. Various criteria for evaluation, such as accuracy, computational efficiency, user-friendliness, and compatibility with different Omics data types, are outlined. The benchmarking results and analysis provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each tool, facilitating informed tool selection. Additionally, case studies demonstrate the practical applications of benchmarking results in specific Omics domains. The article also discusses future directions, challenges, and the impact of benchmarking on advancing Omics research and applications. Systematic benchmarking of Omics computational tools enhances the reliability and reproducibility of analyses, leading to improved data interpretation and scientific discoveries in various fields, including genomics and proteomics.

AB  - Big Data is reforming many industrial domains by providing decision support through analyzing large data volumes. Big Data testing aims to ensure that Big Data systems run smoothly and error-free while maintaining the performance and quality of data. However, because of the diversity and complexity of data, testing Big Data is challenging. Though numerous research efforts deal with Big Data testing, a comprehensive review to address testing techniques and challenges of Big Data is not available as yet. Therefore, we have systematically reviewed the Big Data testing techniques’ evidence occurring in the period 2010–2021. This paper discusses testing data processing by highlighting the techniques used in every processing phase. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future directions. Our findings show that diverse functional, non-functional and combined (functional and non-functional) testing techniques have been used to solve specific problems related to Big Data. At the same time, most of the testing challenges have been faced during the MapReduce validation phase. In addition, the combinatorial testing technique is one of the most applied techniques in combination with other techniques (i.e., random testing, mutation testing, input space partitioning and equivalence testing) to find various functional faults through Big Data testing.

AB  - Immunosuppressive drugs are used in the management of transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. However, immunosuppression can be associated with adverse effects such as infections and cancers. This study aimed to characterize the measures of cumulative immunosuppressive drug exposure (CIDE) used in the literature and their associated outcomes in transplant patients. A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using search terms related to maintenance immunosuppressants and CIDE. Study risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Thirty-one articles were included in this qualitative synthesis. Sixteen articles (52 %) calculated the total dose of immunosuppression over the treatment period, while eight (26 %) used area-under-the-curve of trough level concentrations to quantify CIDE. Five (16 %) articles investigated time-weighted metrics of calcineurin inhibitors and four (13 %) used other metrics that could not be categorized into the previous groups. Most studies investigated CIDE with calcineurin inhibitors and used additive dosing methods. This approach was also popular with corticosteroids and multi-drug exposures. The variety of metrics used in the literature reveals a lack of standardization in the evaluation of CIDE and long-term outcomes. Future studies should validate these metrics for clinical application, especially pertaining to infectious outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19 is a severe respiratory illness that has emerged as a devasting health problem worldwide. The disease outcome is heterogeneous, which is most likely dependent on the immunity of an individual. Asymptomatic and mildly/moderate symptomatic (non-severe) patients likely develop an effective early immune response and clear the virus. However, severe symptoms dominate due to a failure in the generation of an effective and specific early immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a late surge in pathogenic inflammation involves dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses leading to local and systemic tissue damage and the emergence of severe disease symptoms. In this review, we describe the potential mechanisms of protective and pathogenic immune responses in “mild/moderate” and “severe” symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected people, respectively, and discuss the immune components that are currently targeted for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Off-Site Modular Construction (OSMC) research has been a burgeoning research area over the past two decades due to low productivity of traditional construction methods. Some large Gen 3 reactors may employ an on-site assembly area similar to shipbuilding techniques. This OSMC productivity has attracted the interest of the nuclear industry with over 50+ designs in commercial development. Off-site modular construction has been estimated to reduce the capital cost of an SMR by up to 37.98% compared to a stick-built method. The IAEA highlights the first commercial SMR “shop built and road transported to site” has an earliest operation date of 2026 (IAEA, 2018). This research paper aims to understand the current state of modular design in nuclear power by reviewing current literature with a systematic literature review. What can new small modular reactor designs learn from modularisation in large nuclear. What design and analysis techniques have been developed that may aid the design considering design, schedule, transportation and supply chain? What is the state of the art in the module design process? The research provides knowledge gaps and recommendations for further research.

AB  - Abstract:
In April 2023, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published the Official ATS Statement: Race and Ethnicity in Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) Interpretation recommending the adoption of race-neutral reference equations for PFT interpretation. However, lack of a clear roadmap to implement this recommendation effectively remains a challenge. This paper outlines how our large, safety-net hospital systematically transitioned from race-specific to race-neutral reference equations. Our approach, guided by the Kotter Change Model, can serve as a framework for other institutions.

AB  - In the post-pandemic era, the public health community continues to search for innovative tools and technologies to enhance emergency response and preparedness for ongoing and future emergencies. Digital vaccination certificates (DVCs) could support real-time vaccination verification efforts for COVID-19 vaccines and future lifesaving immunizations. Our study objective was to broadly examine current literature on implementing DVCs during the COVID-19 pandemic, including benefits and potential challenges. Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies published between April 2020 and October 2022 and a total of five studies were selected for final analyses. Review findings highlight overall benefits of DVC utilization, legal and privacy, ethical: disparity gaps and barriers implications, and potential technical hurdles. We discuss the benefits of DVC implementation for maintaining privacy, accountability, cost-effectiveness, and authenticity of vaccination verification; however, also acknowledge and explore various challenges, including the need for increased standardization to meet global standards. We argue that our findings help bolster digital vaccination certificate projects into pandemic recovery efforts and future emergency preparedness by building public trust in digital solutions.

AB  - This study examines the default determinants of Fintech loans, utilizing a sample of more than a million of personal loans that were originated through the LendingClub consumer platform during the period 2007–2018. We identify a robust set of contractual loan characteristics, borrower characteristics, and macroeconomic variables that are important in determining the likelihood of default, such as loan maturity, homeownership, loan purposes, occupation, etc. We also find an important role of alternative data in determining the default, even after controlling for the obvious risk characteristics of the borrowers, loan characteristics, and the local economic factors. The results are robust to different empirical approaches. Results imply that it would be important for regulators to provide greater transparency in terms of guidance and regulatory clarity on which alternative data can be used legally without violating fair lending rules. Lenders need to pay closer attention to how they make decisions and understand their own decisions that may be driven by complex algorithms inside the “black boxes.”

AB  - Social media platforms have evolved into an online representation of our social interactions. We may use the resources they provide to analyze phenomena that occur within them, such as the development and viralization of offensive and hostile content. In today’s polarized world, the escalating nature of this behavior is cause for concern in modern society. This research includes an in-depth examination of previous efforts and strategies for detecting and preventing hateful content on the social network Twitter, as well as a novel classification approach based on users’ profiles, related social environment and generated tweets. This paper’s contribution is threefold: (i) an improvement in the performance of the HaterNet algorithm, an expert system developed in collaboration with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes of the Spanish State Secretariat for Security (Ministry of the Interior) that is capable of identifying and monitoring the evolution of hate speech on Twitter using an LTSM + MLP neural network architecture. To that end, a model based on BERT, HaterBERT, has been created and tested using HaterNet’s public dataset, providing results that show a significant improvement; (ii) A methodology to create a user database in the form of a relational network to infer textual and centrality features. This contribution, SocialGraph, has been independently tested with various traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, demonstrating its usefulness in spotting haters; (iii) a final model, SocialHaterBERT, that integrates the previous two approaches by analyzing features other than those inherent in the text. Experiment results reveal that this last contribution greatly improves outcomes, establishing a new field of study that transcends textual boundaries, paving the way for future research in coupled models from a diachronic and dynamic perspective.

AB  - Context: Replications are an important part of scientific disciplines. Replications test the credibility of original studies and can separate true results from those that are unreliable. Objective: In this paper we investigate the replication of defect prediction studies and identify the characteristics of replicated studies. We further assess how defect prediction replications are performed and the consistency of replication findings. Method: Our analysis is based on tracking the replication of 208 defect prediction studies identified by a highly cited Systematic Literature Review (SLR) [1]. We identify how often each of these 208 studies has been replicated and determine the type of replication carried out. We identify quality, citation counts, publication venue, impact factor, and data availability from all 208 SLR defect prediction papers to see if any of these factors are associated with the frequency with which they are replicated. Results: Only 13 (6%) of the 208 studies are replicated. Replication seems related to original papers appearing in the Transactions of Software Engineering (TSE) journal. The number of citations an original paper had was also an indicator of replications. In addition, studies conducted using closed source data seems to have more replications than those based on open source data. Where a paper has been replicated, 11 (38%) out of 29 studies revealed different results to the original study. Conclusion: Very few defect prediction studies are replicated. The lack of replication means that it remains unclear how reliable defect prediction is. We provide practical steps for improving the state of replication.

AB  - This article explores the relationship between masculinity and national security. There may be a reluctance to view the values, attitudes, and beliefs associated with a particular version of masculinity as a driver for violence. Yet, the “real man” version of masculinity is consistently correlated with those who in engage in mass violence, mobilized violence, and violent extremism—which present a threat to national security. The “real man” identity is also correlated with significant gender disparities in quality of life including income, health, happiness, and mortality for men. Such grievances represent yet another driver of discontent and violence. National security requires that we recognize and understand potential threats and subsequently work to mitigate those threats. Men in the US military have traditionally been viewed as prototypical of masculine identity and its associated values, attitudes, and beliefs. As such, this version of masculinity represents a unique institutional context to examine the “real man” version of masculinity, and to advance gender equality and overcome the harms that rigid gender roles present to national security.

AB  - Chirality is one of the most fundamental properties of nature and relates to the ultimate secret of the origin of life. Research on chirality has been a hot topic in many disciplines such as physics, chemistry and biology. Carbon dots, with their unique physicochemical properties and biocompatibility, have quickly become the rising star material in the family of carbon-based nanomaterials since their discovery 20 years ago. Carbonized polymer dots are an important member of the carbon dots family, which is a hot topic in the field of carbon dots research nowadays. Most of the CDs synthesized by the “bottom-up” method should be strictly regarded as CPDs, and as an important branch of carbon-based polymer dots, chiral carbon-based polymer dots (C-CPDs)have been widely used in the fields of sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedicine. In this paper, we provide an overview of the history of chirality, basic concepts, characterization tools, and common methods for obtaining a single chiral molecule, followed by basic information on four carbon-based materials, a review of the synthesis, purification, and application of chiral carbonized polymer dots, and finally an outlook on the future of C-CPDs as a reference for researchers.

AB  - This digest summarises the interdisciplinary research in dry eye disease (DED) published since the 2017 TFOS DEWS II reports. It comprises seven topics including Sex, Gender, and Hormones, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Tear Film, Pain and Sensation, Iatrogenic and Clinical Trial Design and explores how each of these inform diagnostic methodology, disease subtype and management of DED. Sex- and gender-related differences significantly influence the ocular surface due to hormones, sex chromosomes, sex-specific autosomal factors, epigenetics, care-seeking behaviors, and service utilization. Epidemiological data reveal that DED prevalence varies by age and sex, influenced by diagnostic criteria and the multifactorial nature of the disease. New risk factors for DED include environmental, iatrogenic, systemic diseases and lifestyle domains. Pathophysiological distinctions between Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye (ADDE) and Evaporative Dry Eye (EDE) have been clarified. EDE is characterized by a muted inflammatory response at the ocular surface, meibomian gland dysfunction and conceivably phenotypic changes in corneal epithelial cells. There is an expanding role for metabolic, hormonal, physical, neural and cellular stresses, including hyperosmolarity, mitochondrial stress, and neurogenic inflammation. Advancements in tear film research recommend new approaches to understanding DED pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers, such as microRNAs. Ocular pain perception is linked to structural integrity of corneal nerves, functional capacities of neurons, and activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Iatrogenic DED can result from medications, contact lenses, and surgical procedures. Clinical trials now emphasize aligning design and endpoints with DED subtypes and therapeutic mechanisms, with new therapeutics and trial designs under consideration.

AB  - Micro-(nano-)plastics have become emerging contaminants worldwide in recent years. However, there has not been a critical review on their fate and potential risk in intertidal zones with different geological conditions. Thus, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the roles of intertidal zones in accumulation or transportation of microplastics (MPs), involving convergence, migration, plastiglomerate, and ingestion effects. It is found that MPs are likely to be stranded in mudflats but be transported across the sandy beaches according to their intrinsic and external conditions. Meanwhile, MPs could also form the contamination of plastiglomerate and act as vectors for contaminants, even pathogens, in rocky and biological beaches. Thus, MPs together with nanoplastics (NPs) could potentially threaten the ecosystems of the intertidal zone by their ingestion and translocation. In view of the upsurge of personal protective equipment (PPE) during COVID-19, the occurrence of discarded PPE in the intertidal zones has also been summarized and discussed. Despite that the amount of discarded PPE is relatively smaller than other MPs, the pollution caused by these wastes could increase the possibility for pathogen-attached MPs becoming the source for spreading disease among wildlife and humans. It will be of vital importance for understanding the roles of intertidal zone in influencing the fate and ecotoxicity of the MPs. Moreover, the in-depth discussion on fate of the PPE in every type of intertidal zones can be conducive to drawing more attentions on plastic concerns in COVID-19 pandemic and achieving environmental sustainability.

AB  - Introduction
It is unknown if high concentration of airborne grass pollen, where subtropical grasses (Chloridoideae and Panicoideae) dominate, is a risk factor for respiratory health. Here we systematically reviewed the association between airborne grass pollen exposure and asthma emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions in subtropical climates.
Objectives
A systematic review was performed to identify and summarise studies that reported on respiratory health (asthma ED presentations and hospital admissions) and airborne grass pollen exposure in subtropical climates.
Methods
Searches were conducted in: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase and Google Scholar databases (1966–2019). Risk of bias was assessed using a validated quality assessment tool. A meta-analysis was planned, however due to the heterogeneity in study design it was determined inappropriate and instead a narrative synthesis was undertaken.
Results
Nineteen studies were identified for inclusion, with a total of 598,931 asthma ED presentation participants and 36,504 asthma hospital admission participants in six countries (Australia, India, Israel, Italy, Spain, USA). The narrative synthesis found airborne grass pollen appears to have a small and inconsistent increase on asthma ED presentations (judged as: probably little effect n = 5, may have little effect n = 4, no effect n = 2 and uncertain if there is an effect n = 4) and hospital admissions (judged as: probably increase slightly n = 2 probably little effect n = 1, may have a little effect n = 1, no effect n = 3 and we are uncertain if there is an effect n = 4) in the subtropics. Furthermore, the reported effect sizes were small and its clinical relevance may be difficult to discern.
Conclusion
Exposure to airborne grass pollen appears to have a small and inconsistent increase on asthma ED presentations and hospital admissions in the subtropics. These findings are comparable to reported observations from studies undertaken in temperate regions.

AB  - We present an accurate, efficient and massively parallel finite-element code, DFT-FE, for large-scale ab-initio calculations (reaching ∼100,000 electrons) using Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT). DFT-FE is based on a local real-space variational formulation of the Kohn–Sham DFT energy functional that is discretized using a higher-order adaptive spectral finite-element (FE) basis, and treats pseudopotential and all-electron calculations in the same framework, while accommodating non-periodic, semi-periodic and periodic boundary conditions. We discuss the main aspects of the code, which include, the various strategies of adaptive FE basis generation, and the different approaches employed in the numerical implementation of the solution of the discrete Kohn–Sham problem that are focused on significantly reducing the floating point operations, communication costs and latency. We demonstrate the accuracy of DFT-FE by comparing the energies, ionic forces and periodic cell stresses on a wide range of problems with popularly used DFT codes. Further, we demonstrate that DFT-FE significantly outperforms widely used plane-wave codes—both in CPU-times and wall-times, and on both non-periodic and periodic systems—at systems sizes beyond a few thousand electrons, with over 5−10 fold speedups in systems with more than 10,000 electrons. The benchmark studies also highlight the excellent parallel scalability of DFT-FE, with strong scaling demonstrated up to 192,000 MPI tasks.

Nature of problem: Density functional theory calculations. Solution method: We employ a local real-space variational formulation of Kohn–Sham density functional theory that is applicable for both pseudopotential and all-electron calculations with arbitrary boundary conditions. Higher-order adaptive spectral finite-element basis is used to discretize the Kohn–Sham equations. Chebyshev polynomial filtered subspace iteration procedure (ChFSI) is employed to solve the nonlinear Kohn–Sham eigenvalue problem self-consistently. ChFSI in DFT-FE employs Cholesky factorization based orthonormalization, and spectrum splitting based Rayleigh–Ritz procedure in conjunction with mixed precision arithmetic. Configurational force approach is used to compute ionic forces and periodic cell stresses for geometry optimization. Restrictions: Exchange–correlation functionals are restricted to Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), with and without spin. The pseudopotentials available are optimized norm conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopotentials and Troullier–Martins (TM) pseudopotentials. Calculations are non-relativistic. Unusual features: DFT-FE handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the same framework, while accommodating periodic, non-periodic and semi-periodic boundary conditions.

XR improves safety, optimizes mobility, and enhances human-machine interaction.This study presents a bibliometric analysis and thematic review of XR research in transportation. We analyzed 283 Scopus-indexed publications from 2014 to 2024 using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and Python-based libraries. The results show an annual publication growth rate of 18.15%. Cornell University, the University of Glasgow, and Delft University of Technology emerged as leading institutional contributors. National leadership was dominated by the United States, Germany, and China.Thematic mapping identified key areas such as autonomous vehicle validation, pedestrian-AV interaction, AI-driven traffic simulation, immersive driver training, and AR navigation for rail and maritime transport. Keyword analysis emphasized research focuses including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Vehicles, Pedestrian Safety, Mixed Reality, Traffic Simulation, and Human Factors.Despite this progress, significant challenges persist. Studies often lack ecological validity, demographic diversity, scalability, cybersecurity resilience, and ethical transparency. Most XR applications remain confined to laboratory settings with limited real-world validation or cross-cultural generalizability.To address these gaps, we propose integrated frameworks and a strategic research agenda. We emphasize ecological realism, cognitive-adaptive XR designs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical governance.This study consolidates existing knowledge and outlines future research directions. XR is positioned as a transformative and human-centered technology, crucial for advancing safer, smarter, and more inclusive transportation ecosystems.

AB  - Machine learning is the state of the art for many recurring tasks in several heterogeneous domains. In the last decade, it has been also widely used in Precision Agriculture (PA) and Wild Flora Monitoring (WFM) to address a set of problems with a big impact on economy, society and academia, heralding a paradigm shift across the industry and academia. Many applications in those fields involve image processing and computer vision stages. Remote sensing devices are very popular choice for image acquisition in this context, and in particular, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a good tradeoff between cost and area coverage. For these reasons, research literature is rich of works that face problems in Precision Agriculture and Wild Flora Monitoring domains with machine learning/computer vision methods applied to UAV imagery. In this work, we review this literature, with a special focus on algorithms, model sizing, dataset characteristics and innovative technical solutions presented in many domain-specific models, providing the reader with an overview of the research trend in recent years.

AB  - Objective
Summarise the published evidence on otitis media and associated hearing loss in low to middle-income countries (LMIC) and disadvantaged populations.
Data sources
PubMed and other databases.
Review methods
Firstly, sensitive search strategy using ‘otitis media’, combined with specific key words for each topic of the review, from January 2015 to June 2019. Then, restriction to LMIC and disadvantaged populations. Topics covered included prevention, epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment.
Conclusions
There was a high degree of methodological heterogeneity and high risk of bias. The majority of studies were school-based. In Africa, Asia and Oceania (e.g., Australian Aboriginal populations) the prevalence of OM was respectively 8% (range 3-16%), 14% (range 7–22%) and 50% (4–95%). Prevalence of any hearing loss in these regions was 12% (range 8–17%), 12% (range 3–24%), and 26% (range 25–28%) respectively. Risk factors in LMIC and disadvantaged populations included age, gender, exposure to smoke and pollution. Microbiology was reported for otitis media with effusion at time of surgery or ear discharge (acute otitis media with perforation or chronic suppurative otitis media). Specimen handling and processing in hospital laboratories was associated with low detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Case series described complicated cases of OM due to M. tuberculosis, multidrug resistance and HIV. QOL studies identified discrimination of persons with OM and hearing loss. Diagnostic methods varied greatly, from naked eye to tympanometry. Treatment interventions were reported from four RCTs. Non-RCTs included evaluations of guidelines, surgery outcomes, access to ENTs.
Implications for Clinical Practice
Chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss are common in LMIC and disadvantaged populations. Paucity of research, poor regional representation, non-standardised methods and low-quality reporting preclude accurate assessment of disease burden in LMIC and disadvantaged populations. Awareness and adherence to reporting Guidelines should be promoted.

AB  - Detecting leaks in water pipes is a critical task for water utilities, as it helps prevent water loss and damage to infrastructure. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown potential in detecting water pipe leaks, but there are gaps and limitations in the ML modeling process that need to be addressed. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of ML-based techniques for leak detection in water pipes, discussing the general steps to develop an ML-based model, including data collection, data processing, and model development. The study reviews a diverse array of ML-based methods, from traditional ML techniques to advanced deep learning approaches, and introduces their applicability and limitations. Finally, current research limitations and gaps are summarized following the reviews, and potential future directions are suggested, including overcoming data scarcity, enhancing current model performance and interpretability, assessing the potential of various ML-based approaches, and improving the practicability of water management for relevant researchers, engineers, and managers. This study provides a reference for academics and industrial practitioners interested in ML-based water leak detection models, especially in signal processing techniques, model selection and development, and practical applications. The findings contribute to understanding water pipe leak detection, promoting the development of water leak detection technologies, advancing the current water leak management, enhancing the decision-making process, and benefiting water utilities, academics, and end users.

AB  - A review and evaluation of 34 visual methods for ecosystem research revealed that there was no method to visually capture the dynamics of innovation ecosystems. To fill this gap, we develop and demonstrate a new visual method, the ecosystem dynamics mapping (EDM) language, for capturing and analysing (i) structural elements, (ii) structural changes and (iii) dynamic forces in evolving innovation ecosystems over time. To develop the EDM language we applied the design science research methodology (DSRM), conducting a demonstration case in the commercial aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector. The sector's innovation ecosystem is currently experiencing profound dynamics, with a focus in this paper specifically on dynamics that result from servitizing manufacturers. For the demonstration case, we conducted 18 in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 decision-makers at a large incumbent service provider, producing a total of 13 ecosystem dynamics maps. This study attempts to make three contributions. First, it identifies, summarises and evaluates the existing ecosystem visualisation methods. Second, we introduce the new EDM language for visualising the dynamics of innovation ecosystems. Third, we present an EDM demonstration case validating its applicability. The EDM language can be used by researchers, practitioners and policy-makers to better understand how innovation ecosystems are changing, thereby supporting strategic decision-making or policy interventions.

AB  - The data storage burden resulting from large climate model simulations continues to grow. While lossy data compression methods can alleviate this burden, they introduce the possibility that key climate variables could be altered to the point of affecting scientific conclusions. Therefore, developing a detailed understanding of how compressed model output differs from the original is important. Here, we evaluate the effects of two leading compression algorithms, sz and zfp, on daily surface temperature and precipitation rate data from a widely used climate model. While both algorithms show promising fidelity with the original output, detectable artifacts are introduced even at relatively tight error tolerances. This study highlights the need for evaluation methods that are sensitive to errors at different spatiotemporal scales and specific to the particular climate variable of interest.

For Ebola vaccine development, antibody response is a major endpoint although its determinants are not well known. We aimed to review Ebola vaccine studies and to assess factors associated with antibody response variability in humans.
Methods
We searched PubMed and Scopus for preventive Ebola vaccine studies in humans or non-human primates (NHP), published up to February 2018. For each vaccination group with Ebola Zaire antibody titre measurements after vaccination, data about antibody response and its potential determinants were extracted. A random-effects meta-regression was conducted including human groups with at least 8 individuals.
Results
We reviewed 49 studies (202 vaccination groups including 74 human groups) with various vaccine platforms and antigen inserts. Mean antibody titre was slightly higher in NHP (3.10, 95% confidence interval [293; 327]) than in humans (2.75 [257; 293]). Vaccine platform (p<0·001) and viral strain used for antibody detection (p<0·001) were associated with antibody response in humans, but adjusted heterogeneity remained at 95%.
Conclusions
Various platforms have been evaluated in humans, including Ad26, Ad5, ChimpAd3, DNA, MVA, and VSV. In addition to platforms, viral strain used for antibody detection influences antibody response. However, variability remained mostly unexplained. Therefore, comparison of vaccine immunogenicity needs randomised controlled trials.

AB  - The need for fine scale description of vegetation structure is increasing as Leaf Area Density (LAD, m2/m3) becomes a critical parameter to understand ecosystem functioning and energy and mass fluxes in heterogeneous ecosystems. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has shown great potential for retrieving the foliage area at stand, plant or voxel scales. Several sources of measurement errors have been identified and corrected over the past years. However, measurements remain sensitive to several factors, including, 1) voxel size and vegetation structure within voxels, 2) heterogeneity in sampling from TLS instrument (occlusion and shooting pattern), the consequences of which have been seldom analyzed at the scale of forest plots. In the present paper, we aimed at disentangling biases and errors in plot-scale measurements of LAD with TLS in a simulated vegetation scene. Two negative biases were formerly attributed to (i) the unsampled voxels and to (ii) the subgrid vegetation heterogeneity (i.e. clumping effect), and then quantified, thanks to a the simulation experiment providing known LAD references at voxel scale, vegetation manipulations and unbiased point estimators. We used confidence intervals to evaluate voxel-scale measurement accuracy. We found that the unsampled voxel effect (i) led to underestimations with the “mean layer” method –commonly used to fill unsampled voxels- for small voxels (0.1–0.2 m) and/or low number of scans (<4). It was explained by the spatial correlations in vegetation, which induced that dense voxels were more often occluded by dense neighbors than light voxels. The distribution of the bias was heterogeneous in canopy, the bias being stronger at mid canopy where occlusion started, but smaller in highly-occluded upper layers. This somehow counterintuitive result was explained by a more random sampling of upper layers, but could highly depend on vegetation structure. The subgrid vegetation heterogeneity effect (ii) was confirmed to increase with voxel size, yet, the magnitude of this bias -quantified with vegetation manipulation- was found to be more homogeneously-distributed than the unsampled voxel effect. Overall, we found that no scenario was unbiased. However, an intermediate voxel size (0.5 m) was the best option, because the relatively homogeneous subgrid effect could be handled with a single correction factor and voxel-scale measurements errors were reasonable. On the contrary, smaller voxels led to poor voxel-scale measurements and variable biases in magnitude and spatial distribution with sampling design. However, more similar research in other context is required to adapt these conclusions to other forest plots.

AB  - WNT/β-catenin signaling orchestrates various physiological processes, including embryonic development, growth, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. Abnormal WNT/β-catenin signaling is associated with various cancers and its inhibition has shown effective antitumor responses. In this review, we discuss the pathway, potential targets for the development of WNT/β-catenin inhibitors, available inhibitors, and their specific molecular interactions with the target proteins. We also discuss inhibitors that are in clinical trials and describe potential new avenues for therapeutically targeting the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, we introduce emerging strategies, including artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools and technology-based actionable approaches, to translate WNT/β-catenin inhibitors to the clinic for cancer therapy.

AB  - The combined health and economic impact of Taenia solium urges for control and, if possible, elimination of this neglected parasitic zoonosis. Up till now there is still no consensus about the most cost-effective and feasible approaches for control. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and summarize the evidence in English scientific literature on the control and elimination of T. solium since 2014, based on the rapidly evolving field of evidence on control and elimination of T. solium. The search resulted in the identification of 458 records of which 31 were included, covering 13 field trials and 18 articles containing experimental data, mathematical models, and other information directly relevant the control of T. solium. Recent field studies confirm that combinations of interventions or multiple rounds are more successful in obtaining rapid reductions in transmission and parasite occurrence, with the quick impact of the combination of human and pig treatment confirmed in a South Asian and Peruvian context. Moreover, elimination of transmission through a one-year intensive program, combining human and pig treatment/vaccination was described in a Peruvian study. Recent studies also provide more data on the positive impact of specific health education, as well as newly developed electronic educational tools, providing opportunities for area specific community-engaged participatory interventions. Once control has been achieved, monitoring of migration of both potentially infected people and pigs from outside the control area is important for sustained disease control.

AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative disorder of the retina and a leading cause of visual impairment and childhood blindness worldwide. The disease is characterized by an early stage of retinal microvascular degeneration, followed by neovascularization that can lead to subsequent retinal detachment and permanent visual loss. Several factors play a key role during the different pathological stages of the disease. Oxidative and nitrosative stress and inflammatory processes are important contributors to the early stage of ROP. Nitric oxide synthase and arginase play important roles in ischemia/reperfusion-induced neurovascular degeneration. Destructive neovascularization is driven by mediators of the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and metabolic factors (succinate). The extracellular matrix is involved in hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization. Vasorepulsive molecules (semaphorin 3A) intervene preventing the revascularization of the avascular zone. This review focuses on current concepts about signaling pathways and their mediators, involved in the pathogenesis of ROP, highlighting new potentially preventive and therapeutic modalities. A better understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ROP should allow the development of more effective and targeted therapeutic agents to reduce aberrant vasoproliferation and facilitate physiological retinal vascular development.

AB  - Zero Energy Building (ZEB) is gaining more attention as a solution to significantly mitigate the environment concerns. However, a bibliometric analysis of the topic, a very useful method to analyze the database of published publications and reviews, is lacking. Especially, to provide when and how this concept has been brought out, insights into the state-of-art technology, the findings of the collaboration networks and the challenges of ZEB. To address this gap, in this paper, ZEB studies have been reviewed using multiple perspectives and analytical tools, such as VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to analyze the collaboration networks and the thematic trends of ZEB publications. The original data was retrieved in Scopus, a total of 1051 documents including research articles and reviews published from 1976 to 2020. The analysis of the number of publications over the years shows that the development of Zero energy building research has gone through three stages: a slow development period from 1076 to 1999, followed by a development from 2000 to 2010 and finally a rapid development from 2011 to 2020. The study also reveals different rankings, including the most widely collaborated scholars, the most cited scholars, the most published countries, etc. Therein, the United State, United Kingdom and China have the most research on ZEB. Based on the analysis of co-occurrence network and evolution of thematic keywords, it is found that energy efficiency and life cycle assessment (LCA) are the main challenges for the achievement of ZEB target. Finally, these challenges have been discussed and solutions provided.

AB  - The proliferation of online reviews has provoked a substantial deal of academic research, providing proof of online reviews’ influence on purchase intention in consumer behavior. However, the current empirical research often yields inconsistent and inconclusive results. In order to bridge the gap in our understanding of the relationship between purchase intention and its determinants, a meta-analysis of 156 studies with 214 effect sizes and 69,006 observations was conducted. Additionally, two new factors - review content type and review format - were included in the study. The results showed that all antecedents significantly affect purchase intention, with review valence showing the most potent effect (r = 0.563). Furthermore, individualism, product type, and four study characteristics are important moderating factors. In conclusion, this study provides more reliable generalizations, and its findings are beneficial to scholars, managers, retailers, and website owners, for example, to help set the agenda for future research efforts and to provide practical guidance that could boost marketing activities.

AB  - Micro spacecraft which have gained huge popularity in the last decade are termed as “CubeSat”, a well-known class of small satellites. The fast growing functionality and popularity of CubeSat has helped researchers to push the technology demonstration towards efficient performance and reliability needed for commercial and governmental applications. Keeping space debris and use of fossil fuels as propellant in mind, an attempt has been made to develop a green propellant to overcome the issues of space debris, toxicity of propellant and affordable propellant. All liquid propellant based propulsion requires liquid feed system and for that, uses pressurized gas (basically helium) to assist liquid to expel out of the tank. But once the liquid propellant is over, the pressurized gas is unutilized and system runs out of fuel. So the current work, apart from being used as normal cold gas propulsion, it also offers the advantage of using feed system unutilized gases in case of liquid fuel runs out. The present work focuses on cold gas micro thruster development, and its experimental testing in space and sea level condition at various pressure conditions. A computational fluid dynamics model for the same has been developed to validate its experimental results. The thrust value recorded between micro to milli Newton ranges to fulfil the requirements of attitude and station keeping for the CubeSat of 1 to 50 kg dry mass range. Thrust values of 0.8 mN at 1 bar pressure difference to 2.24 mN at 4 bar pressure difference were reported for vacuum environment testing. It’s almost just twice the value of thrust achieved in case of sea level for the corresponding pressure differences. Furthermore, the parameters like pressure, temperature, Mach number, velocity vector, specific impulse, nozzle efficiency etc. are studied and reported for 8 different cases of pressure difference ranging from 1 bar pressure difference to 4 bar pressure difference respectively in atmospheric and vacuum environment.

AB  - Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome observed in 2–5 % of thymomas. Literature reports great variability in its management. Based on an illustrative clinical case, we present a systematic literature review whose main objective is to evaluate the therapeutic management of PRCA. The literature search was performed based on the PICO method in the Medline and Scopus databases. The reference clinical case concerns a 51-year-old woman with stage IVa thymoma. After initial response to chemotherapy, a locoregional progression occurred with PRCA development that responded favorably under second line chemotherapy. The patient finally died in a context of bicytopenia with febrile neutropenia. The systematic review covers 135 articles published between 1950 and 2019. Thymectomy alone or in combination with other therapies showed a 31 % complete remission (CR) rate for PRCA of, whereas none was reported with anti-tumor treatments without thymectomy. Among immunomodulatory therapies, cyclosporin gave the highest percentage of CR (74 %). Finally, the combination of thymectomy and immunomodulatory treatments showed a CR rate of 45 %. Thymectomy appeared to be the most effective anti-tumor treatment for PRCA. Immunomodulatory therapies, particularly cyclosporine, are shown effective, but the risk of infectious complications must be considered. The optimal place of anti-tumor and immunomodulatory therapies against PRCA has yet to be determined.

AB  - Model-driven development is a model-centric software development paradigm that automates the development process by converting high-level models into low-level code and documents. To maintain synchronization between models and code/documents — which can evolve independently — this paper introduces BIT, a bidirectional language that can serve as a conventional template language for model-to-text transformations. However, a BIT program can function as both a printer, generating text by filling template holes with values from the input model, and a parser, putting parsed values back into the model. BIT comprises a surface language for better usability and a core language for formal definition. We define the semantics of the core language based on the theory of bidirectional transformation, and provide the translation from the surface to the core. We present the proof sketch of the well behavedness of BIT as a formal evidence of soundness. We also conduct three case studies to empirically demonstrate the expressiveness and the effectiveness of BIT. Based on the proof and the case studies, BIT covers the major features of existing template languages, and offers sufficient expressiveness to define real-world model-to-text transformations that can be executed bidirectionally and incrementally.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to reduce emissions from the transportation sector and are also capable of providing several services to the power system including resilience during power outages. However, transportation electrification has increased the interdependence of transport and power networks, which could become challenging during periods of extended outages. Consequently, the analysis of the existing literature on the resilience of power systems and EVs is carried out in two parts in this study. In the first part, the use of EVs as a resilience resource for buildings, microgrids, and power systems is discussed. In addition, the use of exhausted EV batteries (second life) for resilience enhancement purposes and collective resilience of power and transport networks are also discussed. In the second part, strategies used for enhancing the resilience of EVs are discussed, which comprise onsite storage deployment, integration of renewable energy sources, design of off-grid charging stations, energy allocation to EVs during outages, and the use of EVs for evacuation during emergencies. Especially, the need to include EVs in making public policies on disaster management is emphasized. Then, the prevailing challenges for realizing these services are discussed along with the research gaps in the existing literature. Finally, several potential research directions are presented to carry out future research based on the existing studies.

AB  - Nowadays, people prefer to read news articles from online sources worldwide due to their easiness and availability. For the last few years, online searching for required information or content has been replaced by item recommendation, and news recommendation is also not an exception. For news recommendations, News Recommender System (NRS) helps the users to find the appropriate and pertinent content, alleviate the problem of information overload, and propose news that would be of interest to news readers. NRS also assists different users all around the world in this regard by recommending the most recent news articles based on their interests and past preferences. Many techniques such as traditional, Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid have been proposed to solve the NRS challenges and issues. DL techniques are considered one of the best techniques and have been successfully applied in various fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). This survey article provides a detailed analysis of DL models-based techniques to build NRS. In this regard, firstly, a comprehensive comparison is provided between published survey articles on NRS and this research work. Secondly, it discusses the background of recommendation systems and their techniques. Furthermore, NRS is explored along with its current research challenges. Then background knowledge of DL and its methods have been discussed along with the analysis of year-wise published relevant articles having DL as the applied technique. The survey also presents widely used datasets and performance evaluation metrics used in the relevant literature. Finally, a detailed discussion provides several future directions and open research challenges for the researchers to consider DL applications in NRS.

AB  - Air pollutants influence the morphological, physiological, and biochemical status of plants, and their impacts vary substantially among different species and cultivars. Current review synthesises published literature on the assessment of air pollution impacts on vegetation, with a specific focus on chronicling and summarizing scientific methods that quantify those impacts. Investigations carried out globally on pollutant-plant exposure-response, and articles that describe impact of air pollutants on plants and pollutant abatement using green infrastructure (GI) were systematically reviewed. 273 articles reviewed indicated that a substantial number of past explorations were on a small spectrum of certain species, mainly wheat, rice, soybean and maize; and fewer on non-crop plant species, which cover most of the urban areas and are part of GI. Furthermore, in lower middle-income countries which face significant pollution loads, even studies on crop species are limited. Most studies either use Air Pollution Tolerance Index, which is not pollutant dependent or concentrate on either Ozone or Particulate Matter (PM) and rarely investigate the impact of multiple pollutants in the atmosphere. Also, very few studies differentiate the effect of PM on plants based on its composition. Subsequently, the best possible experimental set ups and wide array of plant health parameters for determining and understanding the effects of different air pollutants on a variety of plant species has been emphasized. While this review compiled literature-based commendations for academic federations wanting to study and quantify air pollutant impacts on vegetation, numerous pertinent vital topics for future research were identified.

AB  - Context
Sustainability is considered as either a quality requirement or a quality characteristic that should be included in software when environmental protection concerns are being taken into account. However, addressing sustainability in software projects might have an impact on the quality of the software product delivered. Conflicting goals between sustainability and particular software product characteristics should be studied when developing application software, since achieving users’ requirements can be a hindrance in the quest to meet sustainability goals.
Objective
This paper aims to provide an overview of the approaches found in the literature for dealing with interactions between software product quality and sustainability in the context of application software.
Method
A systematic mapping study is conducted to identify practices for managing interactions between software quality characteristics and sustainability. The selected papers are classified according to the quality characteristic considered and their influence on sustainability.
Results
Most of the 66 selected papers focused on validating current technologies concerning their support for sustainability (46%%). The interaction between performance efficiency and energy efficiency is what is reported most and there is a fairly positive interaction. In addition, reliability and usability point to a positive interaction with energy efficiency, while security shows a conflicting interaction with energy efficiency. Functional suitability and maintainability can present both positive and negative interaction, with different goals derived from environmental sustainability.
Conclusions
Interactions between software quality and sustainability have been addressed within an explorative approach. There is a need for additional research work to characterize the impact of interaction on both software quality and sustainability. Furthermore, proposals should be validated in industrial settings.

AB  - Intellectual property rights are indisputably vital to the issue of innovation and access of plant genetic resources for food in particular and the economics of agriculture in general. However, the shaping of these rights and the manner of their implementation in the realm of agricultural biotechnology without any forethought or balancing of public interests have raised a host of issues that impinge on human rights, ethics, morality, and last but not least sustainable development. The developing nations perceive the payment of monopoly rents for the use of intellectual property detrimental for their developmental process. Not only has commodification of biodiversity and genetic resources occurred, the knowledge that underpins these technological developments are increasingly moving from the public to private realms restricting the access of many people to the fruits of biotechnology. To exacerbate matters, these activities have resulted in the erosion and loss of traditional knowledge about biodiversity. This chapter analyzes the arising issues and problems and explores pathways to harmonize rules on plant genetic resources by reviewing the provisions of the Convention of Biological Diversity, the Nagoya Protocol and TRIPS Agreement.

AB  - Cloud application developers enjoy the advantages of a just-in-time infrastructure; they are free to design an application without being concerned where the application will run. Cloud elasticity allows applications to seamlessly absorb additional workload. Cloud users also benefit from the speedup due to parallelization. Sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 cover cloud application developments and provide insights into workflow management. Coordination based on a state machine model is presented in Section 11.4, followed by an in-depth discussion of the MapReduce programming model and one of its applications in Sections 11.5 and 11.6. Hadoop, Yarn, and Tez are covered in Section 11.7, while systems such a Pig, Hive, and Impala are discussed in Section 11.8. An overview of current cloud applications and new application opportunities is presented in Section 11.9, followed by a discussion of cloud applications in science and engineering and in biology research in Sections 11.10 and 11.11, respectively. Social computing and software fault isolations are the subjects of Sections 11.12 and 11.13. Further readings and exercises and problems are contained in Sections 11.14 and 11.15.
