The use of blockchain technology helps reduce transaction costs and allows to make micro transactions in the proposed market. Blockchain also improves the security of the platform because all the involved actors can be certain about the authorship of the information produced in the system.

However, these agents require appropriate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures to coordinate their actions. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel approach for dynamic and flexible configuration of communication networks, which enables integration of reliability and security enhancing measures, while optimizing network load and cost efficiency. In this work, the concept of SDN and traditional networking are compared regarding their applicability for establishing distributed power grid control. In particular, we discuss the aspects of security, reliability, transmission paradigms, topology detection and configuration effort. Using a typical transmission grid scenario, derived from the well-established New England Test System (NETS), we demonstrate the capabilities of SDN to improve significantly on the reliability of MAS communications, while incurring minimal administration overhead. Overall, our study indicates clear benefits of applying SDN for distributed power grid control.","","978-1-5386-1427-3","10.1109/EI2.2017.8245292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8245292","","Power grids;IP networks;Communication networks;Network topology;Topology;Substations;Power system reliability","","7","","24","IEEE","4 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Multiple-Attack-Scenario (MAS) defender-attacker-defender model is proposed by extending the conventional tri-level defender-attacker-defender model. The proposed model considers the uncertainties related to the offensive resource and the interactions involving the security personnel at the top-level, the attacker at the middle-level and the power system operator at the bottom-level. The Column-and-Constraint Generation (C&CG) algorithm is implemented by decomposing the MAS defender-attacker-defender model into an upper-level problem for the security personnel, and a lower-level problem for the attacker involving the optimal power flow analysis-based corrective power re-dispatch implemented by the power system operator. Case studies are performed based on the IEEE RTS79 system, and the results validate that the proposed method is able to minimize the damage when uncertainties are involved in the offensive resource.

The interaction representing the communication between two agents is characterized by edge weights in a signed directed graph where the positive weight of an edge implies cooperation between the two agents while a negative one corresponds to antagonism. Resilient consensus problems without antagonistic interactions have been exhaustively studied, while the security problem of bipartite consensus, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied yet. In this paper, we extend the resilient consensus problem to the case when antagonistic interactions exist. The developed results which are applicable for multi-agent systems with continuous-time dynamics shows that all normal nodes reach resilient bipartite consensus if the associated signed digraph is structurally balanced and has sufficient connectivity in terms of robustness.

They have also pushed the digitization and pixelization of our everyday life. The industry has attained a great achievement in terms of Power consumption, Performance, silicon Area, chip and system Cost as well as Time to market (PPACT). Unfortunately, the pace and benefits of CMOS scaling have now slowed down, yet the explosive demand for chip PPACT is on a completely opposite trajectory due to the rise of Generative AI (GAI), next-generation wireline and wireless (5G-Advanced and 6G) communication, automotive electronics and so forth. On the energy supply side, the worldwide electricity generation increasing at ~6%/year is far less than the growth of the power consumption for just computing alone [1] making the supply vs demand unsustainable. Emerging technologies, such as new material, compound semiconductor devices, and novel circuits and systems both in the Cloud and at the edge are coming to the rescue. But splitting functions then stitching diverse chiplets together is still at the dawn of the new homogeneous and heterogeneous integration (HI) era. It should also be noted that HI should not be limited to semiconductor chips in a package. Some promising progress will be illustrated ranging from electrical, optical, and passive component integration to support co-packaged optics (CPO), Antenna-in-Package/Module (AiP/AiM), socket waveguides, etc. While the advance in devices and manufacturing is essential, there are lots of innovations needed for architectures, systems, algorithms, and circuits to develop the huge variety of applications. Tools like Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and automatic software code generation are supposed to help human engineers to find optimal solutions in a timely manner. However, the pace of enhancement for those tools is around an order of magnitude slower than the Moore's Law. The emergence of machine learning and inference, commonly called ML or AI, is showing a great potential [2], [3] especially when the engineers need to deal with high-dimensional complex options. In fact, many designs assisted by ML have surpassed the PPACT achieved by human engineers using conventional software tools. Following the new large AI foundation model framework, “ChipGPT” could become an essential tool in the future. So far, we have only cracked the tip of the iceberg for all the aforementioned fronts. A lot more challenges and opportunities still lie ahead to be explored.","","979-8-3503-3003-8","10.1109/A-SSCC58667.2023.10347923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10347923","","Semiconductor device modeling;Wireless communication;Technological innovation;Solid modeling;Design automation;Power demand;Moore's Law","","3","","11","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most important capabilities of generative AI is the ability to receive human input, understand it, and output something in return. For an enterprise AI platform, human‐driven refers to the ability to receive inputs in a natural language fashion and generate an expected output or solution.

We explore data augmentation by adding missing fields and textual data to an expurgated IR process log public dataset using few-shot learning, where ChatGPT was conditioned on samples from both the publicly available enhanced base dataset and IR playbooks to allow the generation of the IR process activities and communication data. The enhanced base dataset consists of field attributes from both the refined existing dataset and new required fields from data sources of typical IR tools used by Security Operations Center (SOC) and Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). The generated data seeks to reflect the natural variation in individual IR process paths to further enrich the dataset with realistic and contextually accurate examples that align with real-world IR scenarios.

Using their advanced text processing and comprehension abilities, LLMs accurately analyze extensive network traffic to pinpoint potential threats and unusual behavior patterns. This can significantly reduce false alarms and missed detections, improving overall detection efficiency. However, current research on using Transformer-Based LLMs faces two main challenges. Primarily, concentrating solely on extracting features from packet bytes inadequately represents traffic and overlooks the significance of flow features in differentiating attacks. Furthermore, the quadratic computational complexity of Transformer-Based LLM models hinders cost-effective computation and deployment for intrusion detection systems. To address these challenges, we propose Norns, an effective multimodal linear state-space model with a comprehensive method for characterizing traffic. Using flow feature maps and bytes from multiple packets as input data, Norns significantly enhances traffic representation.

A better understanding of prompting impacts both performance in certain tasks and cost. As we move through the chapter, various facets of cost optimization, including caching, model optimization methods, and hyperparameter tuning, among others, are discussed in detail. Summarization in the context of LLMs and GenAI serves as a critical technique both for enhancing the efficiency of processing large datasets and for optimizing the storage of information. Quantization reduces model size and speeds up inference, while in‐flight batching and tensor parallelism optimize resource usage for parallel processing.

In particular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged images, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images, medical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is task-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing prompt inputs.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-5300-6","10.1109/CVPR52733.2024.02207","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106078); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10657214","Domain Adaptation;Segment Anything Model;Weakly Supervised Adaptation","Image segmentation;Computer vision;Costs;Large language models;Robustness;Computational efficiency;Pattern recognition","","10","","75","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose an automatic script generation method to produce emotional scripts by providing seed words with sentiment polarity and phrases of nonverbal vocalizations to ChatGPT using prompt engineering. We select 514 scripts with balanced phoneme coverage from the generated candidate scripts with the assistance of emotion confidence scores and language fluency scores. Experimental results show that JVNV has better phoneme coverage and emotion recognizability than previous Japanese emotional speech corpora. We then benchmark JVNV on emotional text-to-speech synthesis using discrete codes to represent NVs. The results demonstrate that there still exists a gap between the performance of synthesizing read-aloud speech and emotional speech, and adding NVs in the speech makes the task even harder, which brings new challenges for this task and makes JVNV a valuable resource for relevant works in the future.

Early mental disorder detection can lead to cost savings for public health agencies and avoid the onset of other major comorbidities. Additionally, the shortage of specialized personnel is a critical issue because clinical depression diagnosis is highly dependent on expert professionals and is time-consuming.In this study, we explore the use of GPT-4 for clinical depression assessment based on transcript analysis. We examine the model’s ability to classify patient interviews into binary categories: depressed and not depressed. A comparative analysis is conducted considering prompt complexity (e.g., using both simple and complex prompts), as well as varied temperature settings, to assess the impact of prompt complexity and randomness on the model’s performance. Results indicate that GPT-4 exhibits considerable variability in accuracy and F1-Score across configurations, with optimal performance observed at lower temperature values (0.0-0.2) for complex prompts. However, beyond a certain threshold (temperature ≥ 0.3), the relationship between randomness and performance becomes unpredictable, diminishing the gains from prompt complexity. These findings suggest that, while GPT-4 shows promise for clinical assessment, the configuration of the prompts and model parameters requires careful calibration to ensure consistent results. This preliminary study contributes to understanding the dynamics between prompt engineering and large language models, offering insights for future development of AI-powered tools in clinical settings.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10825184","LLM;GPT;Clinical Depression;classification models;Variability","Costs;Mental disorders;Large language models;Depression;Data models;Complexity theory;Prompt engineering;Personnel;Public healthcare;Interviews","","2","","20","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A Dynamic Game Framework for Rational and Persistent Robot Deception With an Application to Deceptive Pursuit-Evasion","L. Huang; Q.

We present an  $N$ -player  $K$ -stage game with an asymmetric information structure where each robot’s private information is modeled as a random variable or its type. The deception is persistent as each robot’s private type remains unknown to other robots for all stages. The deception is rational as robots aim to achieve their deception goals at minimum cost. Each robot forms a dynamic belief of others’ types based on intrinsic or extrinsic information. Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE) is a natural solution concept for dynamic games of incomplete information. Due to its requirements of sequential rationality and belief consistency, PBNE provides a reliable prediction of players’ actions, beliefs, and expected cumulative costs over the entire  $K$  stages. The contribution of this work is fourfold. First, we identify the PBNE computation as a nonlinear stochastic control problem and characterize the structures of players’ actions and costs under PBNE. We further derive a set of extended Riccati equations with cognitive coupling under the linear-quadratic (LQ) setting and extrinsic belief dynamics. Second, we develop a receding-horizon algorithm with low temporal and spatial complexity to compute PBNE under intrinsic belief dynamics. Third, we investigate a deceptive pursuit-evasion game as a case study and use numerical experiments to corroborate the results. Finally, we propose metrics, such as deceivability, reachability, and the price of deception (PoD), to evaluate the strategy design and the system performance under deception. Note to Practitioners—Recent advances in automation and adaptive control in multi-agent systems enable robots to use deception to accomplish their objectives. Deception involves intentional information hiding to compromise the security and operational efficiency of the robotic systems. This work proposes a dynamic game framework to quantify the impact of deception, understand the robots’ behaviors and intentions, and design cost-efficient strategies under the deception that persists over stages. Existing research studies on robot deception have relied on experiments while this work aims to lay a theoretical foundation of deception with quantitative metrics, such as deceivability and the PoD. The proposed model has wide applications, including cooperative robots, pursuit and evasion, and human–robot teaming. The pursuit-evasion games are used as case studies to show how the deceiver can amplify the deception by belief manipulation and how the deceived robots can reduce the negative impact of deception by enhanced maneuverability and Bayesian learning. The future work would focus on designing cooperative deception among swarm robotics and robotic systems that are robust to or further benefit from the deception.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3097286","National Science of Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:ECCS-1847056,CNS-1544782,CNS-2027884,SES-1541164); Army Research Office (ARO)(grant numbers:W911NF-19-1-0041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494340","Discrete-time Riccati equations;linear-quadratic (LQ) games;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;pursuit-evasion;robot deception","Intelligent robots;Games;Bayes methods;Probability distribution;Riccati equations","","17","","41","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This increased interest has spotlighted Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), which possess the capability to operate independently and covertly, making them a preferred choice for diverse underwater tasks. However, as underwater missions grow in complexity, the limitations of individual AUVs have spurred the exploration of multi-AUV systems. These systems offer higher efficiency, greater intelligence, and enhanced fault tolerance, rendering them indispensable in both deep-sea search and rescue missions and national maritime security efforts. Task allocation is a central challenge in the realm of multi-AUV systems. Balancing factors like search environments, ocean currents, obstacles, and target locations, various intelligent optimization methods have been employed. This paper references representative works to explore genetic algorithm-based decentralized task allocation and Hungarian algorithm-based decentralized task allocation, examining their potential to enhance cooperative underwater searches. Centralized task allocation faces robustness and scalability concerns, necessitating decentralized alternatives, particularly for mobile multi-agent systems. The presented research underscores the significance of decentralized methodologies in optimizing multi-AUV task assignments. The paper elucidates these two approaches, discusses their implications, and concludes by presenting an analysis of the results. Through this study, the paper contributes to advancing the field of multi-AUV systems and their effective coordination for efficient underwater search operations.","","979-8-3503-0702-3","10.1109/ISPCEM60569.2023.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499350","Multi-AUV systems;Decentralized genetic algorithm;DHBA;Decentralized task allocation","Oceans;Scalability;Signal processing algorithms;Transportation;Signal processing;Robustness;Resource management","","","","16","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It economizes the communication bandwidth usage, especially when bits are critical while strengthening security by eliminating the transmission of sensitive system information including the initial system states. However, non-differentiable virtual control inputs, stemming from the discrete neighboring states received only at triggering instants, make backstepping technique difficult to proceed. An auxiliary system is elaborately constructed for more general MASs, which postpones these discrete signals to the final step of backstepping-based consensus control.

However, with nations worldwide actively pursuing carbon neutrality and emission peak goals, sustainable energy sources such as solar and wind are increasingly penetrating distribution networks, posing significant challenges to conventional fault detection, classification, and localization techniques due to bidirectional power flows, dynamic fault currents, and rising network complexity. These challenges manifest as reduced sensitivity of protection systems in distribution networks, increased difficulty in identifying high impedance faults, and frequent misclassification or mislocation of faults under dynamic network conditions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a comprehensive review of artificial intelligence-driven approaches and emerging technologies that are specifically tailored for fault analysis in distribution networks, to enhance diagnostic accuracy, adaptability, and real-time decision-making efficiency. Following the chronological development of artificial intelligence, the review systematically investigates smart fault detection methods applied to fault scenarios in distribution networks, with a particular emphasis on presenting fault type classification and fault localization separately to facilitate a logically structured understanding. In addition, common types of distribution network faults are examined, and the impact of distributed generation on fault behavior, electrical characteristics, and protection coordination is critically assessed. The review further distinguishes between artificial intelligence-based smart approaches that directly process raw distribution networks signal data and those that rely on advanced feature extraction techniques to enhance functional performance.

However, as Industry 5.0 integrates DT with generative AI technologies via APIs and tokens, security risks increase. Outdated modeling tools, coupled with vulnerabilities in resource-constrained environments, such as limited computational power and bandwidth, further compromise DT security. These constraints impede the implementation of robust security measures like encryption, authentication, and blockchain, making DT susceptible to cyber threats and fraud. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a secure DT conceptual architecture that leverages edge-fog-cloud computing with Federated Learning (FL), and Blockchain. The framework ensures resource-efficient security by integrating privacy-preserving computations, secure data storage, and resilient communication channels. It effectively mitigates risks beyond 51% attacks, including Sybil attacks and data manipulation, while enabling secure data exchange and realtime monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed architecture improves adaptability in complex IIoT environments, supporting seamless device integration, scalability, and energy-efficient operations to safeguard industrial systems against evolving threats.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2025.3554031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10937969","","Industrial Internet of Things;Security;Blockchains;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Firewalls (computing);Ecosystems;Data privacy;Data models;Computer security","","","","","IEEE","24 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The results are generally good, however still require significant validation to ensure both adequate quality and repeatability prior to deployment, but there is a clear benefit in terms of productivity for engineers in many scenarios. There is however even greater potential for much wider and deeper use of AI methods where greater creativity and exploration could be envisaged including novel topologies, conceptual exploration, creative design, morphic and adaptive design, design space exploration and the identification of novel design features from empirical, simulation and analytical data sources. This paper will explore the further potential of AI and identify approaches that can be applied in design automation to achieve greater leverage of the power of AI in practical scenarios.","","979-8-3503-5586-4","10.1109/DMC62632.2024.10812151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812151","Artificial Intelligence;Design Automation;Computational Intelligence;Machine Learning","Electric potential;Design automation;Design methodology;Soft sensors;Reliability engineering;Power electronics;Data models;Topology;Space exploration;Artificial intelligence","","1","","23","IEEE","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it often remains unclear how the models actually process code, and to what extent their reasoning and the way their attention mechanism scans the code matches the patterns of developers. A poor understanding of the model reasoning process limits the way in which current neural models are leveraged today, so far mostly for their raw prediction. To fill this gap, this work studies how the processed attention signal of three open large language models - CodeGen, InCoder and GPT-J - agrees with how developers look at and explore code when each answers the same sensemaking questions about code. Furthermore, we contribute an open-source eye-tracking dataset comprising 92 manually-labeled sessions from 25 developers engaged in sensemaking tasks. We empirically evaluate five heuristics that do not use the attention and ten attention-based post-processing approaches of the attention signal of CodeGen against our ground truth of developers exploring code, including the novel concept of follow-up attention which exhibits the highest agreement between model and human attention. Our follow-up attention method can predict the next line a developer will look at with 47% accuracy. This outperforms the baseline prediction accuracy of 42.3%, which uses the session history of other developers to recommend the next line. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging the attention signal of pre-trained models for effective code exploration.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2024.3445338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645745","Attention mechanism;code exploration;eye tracking;follow-up attention;neural models of code","Codes;Task analysis;Gaze tracking;Transformers;Cognition;Attention mechanisms;Visualization","","1","","73","CCBY","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In these systems, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is commonly used for background information retrieval. However, as the size of the dataset increases, the search speed becomes significantly slower. In this paper, we propose Tiered Cache-HNSW (TC-HNSW) that caches pre-categorized datasets in layers. TC- HNSW prioritizes caching frequently accessed nodes into faster storage based on the number of accesses and their category, allowing faster searches. This paper describes TC- HNSW system design, caching strategy, and the efficiency of categorization-based caching. Our preliminary evaluation shows that categorization-based caching improves performance, achieving search speeds four times faster than traditional methods when search topics are specified.","","979-8-3315-0412-0","10.1109/ICCT-Pacific63901.2025.11012786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11012786","RAG;Hierarchical Caching;Categorization","Costs;Generative AI;Databases;Retrieval augmented generation;Memory management;Nearest neighbor methods;Information retrieval;Vectors;System analysis and design","","","","12","IEEE","30 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional cryptanalysis methods, such as linear and differential attacks, often require extensive mathematical modelling and computational effort. In contrast, deep learning enables automated feature extraction and pattern recognition, potentially identifying cryptographic weaknesses more efficiently. This paper presents an advanced neural network-based cryptanalysis framework targeting modern encryption schemes, including AES, RSA, and lightweight block ciphers. We employ deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to analyse ciphertext-plaintext relationships and recover cryptographic keys. Additionally, we explore the impact of data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and model interpretability on cryptanalysis accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that deep learning can achieve significant improvements in key recovery probability compared to conventional approaches. However, we also highlight the computational challenges and practical limitations of deep-learning-based cryptanalysis.
