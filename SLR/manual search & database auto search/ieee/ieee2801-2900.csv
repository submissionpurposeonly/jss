This article presents a study on using supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key attributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts. Specifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes—communication and proportional navigation—which combine to define four mutually exclusive swarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm classification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing intelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through simulated swarm-versus-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms of observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm size. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using short observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful degradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent scalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents. These capabilities are promising for real-time decision-making support in defense scenarios by rapidly inferring insights about swarm behavior.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2024.3447615","Office of Naval Research Science of Autonomy Program(grant numbers:N0001424WX01651); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643723","Fleet coordination;onboard intelligence;swarms;UAV interactions","Artificial neural networks;Navigation;Mathematical models;Accuracy;Vectors;Trajectory;Real-time systems","","","","23","USGov","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a first-principles risk assessment framework underlying the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice for AI Risk, Safety, Trustworthiness, and Responsibility. We distinguish between process risks (risks arising from how AI systems are built or operated) and outcome risks (risks manifest in the AI system's outputs and their real-world effects), arguing that generative AI governance should prioritize outcome risks. Central to our approach is an information-centric ontology that classifies AI-generated outputs into four fundamen-tal categories: (1) Perception-level information, (2) Knowledge-level information, (3) Decision/Action plan information, and (4) Control tokens (access or resource directives). This classification allows systematic identification of harms and more precise attribution of responsibility to stakeholders (developers, deployers, users, regulators) based on the nature of the information produced. We illustrate how each information type entails distinct outcome risks (e.g, deception, misinformation, unsafe recommendations, security breaches) and requires tailored risk metrics and mitigations. By grounding the framework in the essence of information, human agency, and cognition, we align risk evaluation with how AI outputs influence human understanding and action. The result is a principled approach to AI risk that supports clear accountability and targeted safeguards, in contrast to broad application-based risk categorizations. We include example tables mapping information types to risks and responsibilities. This work aims to inform the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice and broader AI governance with a rigorous, first-principles foundation for assessing generative AI risks while enabling responsible innovation.","","979-8-3315-2400-5","10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11050553","Risk;Information Categorization;AI Agency;Human Agency;GenAl","Ethics;Technological innovation;Regulators;Generative AI;Standards organizations;Organizations;Cognition;Stakeholders;Security;Fake news","","","","23","IEEE","7 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With constant improvement of the Internet of Things, real-time systems needed different software architectures and communication systems to enable their remote operation, with the same degree of flexibility when operating the systems in-situ.

Within this context, the detection of abnormal IoT traffic in mobile communications assumes paramount importance, especially in the industrially diverse connectivity sector. Against this backdrop, deep learning-based techniques for anomaly detection in traffic data have emerged as a pivotal solution. However, the latest deep learning algorithms often lack a theoretical basis for hyperparameter settings, relying heavily on empirical experience from practical engineering. This necessitates prolonged training and tuning processes, which are particularly costly and time-consuming in the era of large-scale models like LLMs, where every parameter adjustment entails extensive training and testing durations. Addressing this challenge, our study innovatively proposes the integration of mathematical characteristics of data, specifically eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data matrix, into the construction and training of Transformer models. This approach leverages the intrinsic properties of traffic data, enhancing the model’s effectiveness and efficiency. Our methodology encompasses three key initiatives: (1) Utilizing eigenvectors to initialize model weights; (2) Employing eigenvalues to determine the weighting of each head in the Transformer model; (3) Utilizing eigenvectors to define the number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism. Empirical results from our experiments demonstrate that this novel approach facilitates quicker optimization of model parameters, with an average performance improvement of 3% compared to models with random initialization. Moreover, the integration of data matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors with the Transformer’s multi-head attention mechanism exhibits a significant mathematical correlation, underscoring the efficacy of our proposed method.","2376-6506","979-8-3503-6126-1","10.1109/IWCMC61514.2024.10592399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10592399","IoT;Traffic Detection;Matrix Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors;Attention Mechanism;Transformer","Training;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Attention mechanisms;Text categorization;Telecommunication traffic;Transformers","","","","17","IEEE","17 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing methods and tools that aim to decrease the complexity of setting up such systems through modeling-based approaches often focus on single-robot interaction and rely on manual data entries, thus limiting their scalability and applicability to more intricate multi-robot environments. This contribution introduces the Robot ion Method (RobAM), a conceptual modeling method developed to decrease the design complexity of CPS through additional layers of abstraction. By utilizing conceptual modeling, capabilities of humanoid robots can be leveraged for the design of multi-robot interactions. Thereby, our approach enhances the modeling of complex CPS as well as the subsequent generation of code to enable efficient deployments. Through an experimental scenario, we demonstrate how RobAM simplifies the development process of CPS, paving the way for advancements regarding the integration of AI-supported technologies, such as Large Language Models, to ultimately generate contextually relevant semantics for future system design.","2768-1734","979-8-3503-7301-1","10.1109/WF-IoT62078.2024.10811410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811410","","Adaptation models;Limiting;Scalability;Large language models;Semantics;System integration;Manuals;Cyber-physical systems;Programming;Complexity theory","","","","19","IEEE","30 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, three objectives are achieved: trust, cooperation and privacy. The trust of agents depends on the credibility of trust evaluators, which is verified using the proposed methods of trust distortion, consistency and reliability. To enhance the cooperation between agents, a tit-3-for-tat (T3FT) repeated game strategy is developed. The strategy is more forgiving than the existing tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy. It encourages cheating agents to re-establish their trust by cooperating for three consecutive rounds of play. Also, a proof-of-cooperation consensus protocol is proposed to improve agents' cooperation while creating and validating blocks. The privacy of agents is preserved in this work using the publicly verifiable secret sharing mechanism. The proposed methods are implemented using MATLAB R2018a while the MAS is simulated using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. From the simulation results, the proposed trust method outperforms an existing fuzzy logic trust method in terms of detecting the cheating behavior of agents in the system.

Existing speech backdoor attack methods typically utilize fixed and unnoticeable perturbations as triggers, but these may still be audible and thus detected during training and inference stages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel backdoor attack paradigm (PhaseBack) injecting triggers in the phase spectrum. PhaseBack exhibits sufficient stealth by leveraging the fact that the human ear is insensitive to phase information. Besides, injecting partial perturbations in the frequency domain results in global perturbations throughout the time domain, making the attack more effective. Extensive experiments on the Voxceleb1 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of PhaseBack.

These malicious sensor attacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the cooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS. Moreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and manipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient containment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of correlated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator attacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve the bounded containment performance. Compared to existing literature addressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused in the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are resilient against unknown and unbounded attack signals simultaneously, injected into the sensor and actuator channels, and, hence, more practical in real-world security applications.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence application, LLMs have achieved excellent results through vertical domain integration with different fields. However, in the domain of power operation and maintenance, due to the vast amount of specialized knowledge, frequent content updating etc, there are numerous challenges for the LLMs to generate specialized knowledge of power operation and maintenance. Currently, researchers have attempted to use general LLM to build power operation specialist, but it has limited interaction with users, which cannot address the collaboration issues. At the same time, the range of power operation questions is extremely broad, which poses challenges to the judgment and processing capabilities of LLM. To address these problems, we propose a Dual-Stage Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Generation Approach for Intelligent Power Operation and Maintenance called PoD-RAG. This method introduces dual-stage retrieval-augmented generation technology, ensuring the reliability and usability of the generated content for power operation and maintenance. In the first stage, PoD-RAG exploits vertical question-answer pairs for supervised fine-tuning, assuring the professionalism and compliance of the LLM. In the second stage, the method provides answers through RAG, then uses a self-reflection mode to allow the LLM to autonomously judge the generated content, balancing the security and professional needs of power operation and maintenance. To validate the effectiveness of the method, we conducted experiments using professional data and knowledge base from power operation and maintenance. The results indicate that PoD-RAG is highly stable in generating professional responses in the power domain, providing support for power infrastructure construction.","","979-8-3315-9510-4","10.1109/BigDataSecurity66063.2025.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11006824","Retrieval-Augmented Generation;Power Operation and Maintenance;Self-reflection;Fine-Tuning;Large Language Model","Accuracy;Large language models;Retrieval augmented generation;Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Decision making;Natural language processing;Maintenance;Security;Usability","","","","21","IEEE","21 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, their expressiveness and modularity means that to use them, a developer must laboriously annotate all the functions in their code with potentially complex type specifications that specify the contract for that function. We present LHC, a neurosymbolic agent that uses LLMs to automatically generate refinement type annotations for all the functions in an entire package or module, using the refinement type checker LiquidHaskell as an oracle to verify the correctness of the generated specifications. We curate a dataset of three Haskell packages where refinement types are used to enforce a variety of correctness properties from data structure invariants to low-level memory safety and use this dataset to evaluate LHC. Previously these packages required expert users several days to weeks to annotate with refinement types. Our evaluation shows that even when using relatively smaller models like the 3 billion parameter StarCoder LLM, by using fine-tuning and carefully chosen contexts, our neurosymbolic agent generates refinement types for up to 94% of the functions across entire libraries automatically in just a few hours, thereby showing that LLMs can drastically shrink the human effort needed to use formal verification.","1558-1225","979-8-3315-0569-1","10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11029908","llm;ai4code;refinement types;liquid haskell","Large Hadron Collider;Data structures;Software;Libraries;Safety;Security;Logic;Contracts;Formal verification;Context modeling","","","","50","IEEE","23 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These deep vulnerability detectors are mostly trained in a supervised manner, which heavily relies on large-scale, high-quality vulnerability datasets. However, the vulnerability datasets used to train deep vulnerability detectors frequently exhibit class imbalance due to the inherent nature of vulnerability data, where vulnerable cases are significantly rarer than non-vulnerable cases. This imbalance adversely affects the effectiveness of these detectors. A promising solution to address the class imbalance problem is to artificially generate vulnerable samples to enhance vulnerability datasets, yet existing vulnerability generation techniques are not satisfactory due to their inadequate representation of real-world vulnerabilities or their reliance on large-scale vulnerable samples for training the generation model. This paper proposes G VI, a novel approach aimed at generating vulnerable samples to boost deep vulnerability detectors. G VI takes inspiration from human learning with imagination and proposes exploring LLMs to imagine and create new, informative vulnerable samples from given seed vulnerabilities. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought inspired prompt in GVI that instructs the LLMs to first analyze the seed to retrieve attributes related to vulnerabilities and then generate a set of vulnerabilities based on the seed's attributes. Our extensive experiments on three vulnerability datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul) and across three deep vulnerability detectors (i.e., Devign, Re Veal, and Line Vul) demonstrate that the vulnerable samples generated by G VI are not only more accurate but also more effective in enhancing the performance of deep vulnerability detectors.","1558-1225","979-8-3315-0569-1","10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11029920","","Training;Deep learning;Accuracy;Detectors;Boosting;Software;Security;Software engineering","","","","55","IEEE","23 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, practical limitations, such as closed-source models and restricted access, often result in limited training samples. Therefore, training a general detector with few-shot samples is essential for modern detection mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose FAMSeC, a general AI-generated image detection method based on LoRA-based Forgery Awareness Module and Semantic feature-guided Contrastive learning strategy. To effectively learn from limited samples and prevent overfitting, we developed a forgery awareness module (FAM) based on LoRA, maintaining the generalization of pre-trained features. Additionally, to cooperate with FAM, we designed a semantic feature-guided contrastive learning strategy (SeC), making the FAM focus more on the differences between real/fake image than on the features of the samples themselves.

Recent significant developments in AI technology including generative AI, such as TransFormer-based algorithms, have made us realise that those technologies have the potential to produce more accurate trajectory prediction. This study aims to develop a method of trajectory prediction using AI from AIS data. We used the data of fishing vessels tracked in Japanese territorial waters of the Pacific Ocean, which includes latitude, longitude, ship over ground, and course over ground, and converted them into four-hot vectors to analyse the complex trajectories. The accuracy of the prediction was evaluated by accumulating the distance between the predicted value and the actual measurement value for each time. Our results showed that the TransFormer-based method can predict the fishing vessels’ trajectories which had been failed to predict by the LSTM-based method in previous studies. We conclude that the use of AI technology can contribute to the improvement of maritime traffic safety and sustainability, and could lead to more effective and versatile trajectory prediction algorithms.","","979-8-3503-5409-6","10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10605471","Trajectory prediction;AIS data;AI technology;TransFormer;Four-hot vectors;LSTM","Accuracy;Transformers;Prediction algorithms;Vectors;Time measurement;Trajectory;Security","","2","","6","IEEE","30 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, established paradigms like STIX have emerged as de facto standards within the CTI community, emphasizing the formal categorization of entities and relations to facilitate consistent data sharing. In this paper, we introduce AGIR (Automatic Generation of Intelligence Reports), a transformative Natural Language Generation tool specifically designed to address the pressing challenges in the realm of CTI reporting. AGIR’s primary objective is to empower security analysts by automating the labor-intensive task of generating comprehensive intelligence reports from formal representations of entity graphs. AGIR utilizes a two-stage pipeline by combining the advantages of template-based approaches and the capabilities of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. We evaluate AGIR’s report generation capabilities both quantitatively and qualitatively. The generated reports accurately convey information expressed through formal language, achieving a high recall value (0.99) without introducing hallucination. Furthermore, we compare the fluency and utility of the reports with state-of-the-art approaches, showing how AGIR achieves higher scores in terms of Syntactic Log-Odds Ratio (SLOR) and through questionnaires.

Yet, drastically different from natural languages, source code watermarking requires far stricter and more complicated rules to ensure the readability as well as the functionality of the source code. Hence we introduce SrcMarker, a watermarking system to unobtrusively encode ID bitstrings into source code, without affecting the usage and semantics of the code. To this end, SrcMarker performs transformations on an AST-based intermediate representation that enables unified transformations across different programming languages. The core of the system utilizes learning-based embedding and extraction modules to select rule-based transformations for watermarking. In addition, a novel feature-approximation technique is designed to tackle the inherent non-differentiability of rule selection, thus seamlessly integrating the rule-based transformations and learning-based networks into an interconnected system to enable end-to-end training.

Therefore, knowledge management (KM) of CQM is underinvestigated. To offering a comprehensive view of KM in CQM, this article employed a mixed review method to critically review 87 related articles. The results indicate 1) building information modeling, ontology, and natural language processing are identified as critical technologies in KM, 2) expert system and decision support, structural health monitoring, and project management are the major application domains. This article conducts an in-depth analysis of the literature based on the three phases of quality control: pre-construction, in-construction, and post-construction. The results are discussed to critically assess the critical technologies in KM. A framework is proposed to guide the effective implementation of KM in CQM, alongside a discussion of the current challenges and opportunities. The article further identifies potential development directions for KM in CQM, including total quality management, digital twins, development of large language models, construction of “No-cost” KM platforms, uniform evaluation and standardization mechanisms, tacit knowledge capture, and confidentiality and security. A novel paradigm for knowledge-driven quality management decision-making is first introduced.

The sequence contains temporal relations among attack actions, such as a malware is first downloaded and then executed. Information related to temporal relations enables cybersecurity practitioners to investigate past cyberattack incidents and analyze attackers' behavior. However, cybersecurity practitioners must extract such information automatically, in a structured manner, through a common vocabulary to reduce human effort and enable sharing, and collaboration. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in proactive defense against attacks by automatic information extraction of temporal relations among attack actions from cyberthreat intelligence reports. We propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for extracting temporal relations among attack actions from CTI reports. The attack actions are represented as MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and the relations are represented as a knowledge graph. To construct ChronoCTI, we build a ground truth dataset of temporal relations and apply large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. ChronoCTI demonstrates higher precision but lower recall performance on a real-world dataset of 94 CTI reports. ChronoCTI achieves macro precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.75, 0.46, and 0.54, respectively. ChronoCTI aids practitioners in analyzing large volumes of CTI reports, thinking like attackers, and knowing what attack actions are likely to happen next, which enables the practitioners to assess imminent threats and strengthen their cybersecurity readiness.","2374-8486","979-8-3315-0668-1","10.1109/ICDM59182.2024.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10884120","Tactics;Techniques;and Procedures;MITRE ATT&CK;Temporal relation;Cyberthreat intelligence;CTI reports;Knowledge graph;attack graph;TimeML","Vocabulary;Large language models;Pipelines;Collaboration;Knowledge graphs;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Malware;Cyber threat intelligence;Data mining","","1","","63","IEEE","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern spam emails span multiple categories, including advertising spam, which promotes products or services; scam spam, which attempts to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information; and malicious spam, which carries phishing links or malware. Traditional techniques usually detect spam emails by analyzing specific word patterns or applying a rule-based filtering system. However, spammers now employ more sophisticated language to evade detection, making it harder to recognize spam emails. Traditional methods may overlook subtle contextual and behavioral indicators critical for distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Recent advancements in large language models present new opportunities by capturing complex patterns related to urgency, requests for sensitive information, and deceptive linguistic structures. This study explores a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) derived features to enhance spam detection, especially with classifiers that benefit from diverse feature sets. We evaluate this combined feature set across multiple machine learning classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Our findings reveal that this hybrid approach significantly improves model performance, with Random Forest achieving high accuracy (99.86%), precision (98.46%), and recall (100%). Notably, other classifiers, like K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree, benefit from the added contextual and behavioral cues. The results demonstrate the importance of a multifaceted approach for detecting spam emails, where linguistic patterns and contextual features together can capture the deceptive tactics used by spammers. This research demonstrates the value of combining term-based methods with advanced language model features, providing a novel, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing email security systems against diverse spam threats.","","979-8-3315-0769-5","10.1109/CCWC62904.2025.10903847","Commonwealth Cyber Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10903847","Spam Email Detection;Large Language Model;Generative Pre-trained Transformer;TF-IDF;Machine Learning;Threat Detection","Unsolicited e-mail;Computational modeling;Phishing;Nearest neighbor methods;Linguistics;Feature extraction;Transformers;Frequency diversity;Decision trees;Random forests","","1","","44","IEEE","5 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compare the European Commission’s eTranslation service, DeepL, Google Translate, and the Watson Language Translator, using an automated, extensible, and open-source pipeline. Parallel biomedical corpora are identified and used to translate German, French, and Spanish sentences to English. We apply evaluation metrics, BLEU, ROUGE, and BLEURT, and additionally rank translations in a human validation. We found that both the evaluation metrics and the human validation indicate a higher translation quality of DeepL and Google Translate, compared to the Watson Language Translator and eTranslation. Also, human raters identified more errors in eTranslation and Watson Language Translator translations. The BLEURT metric reaches the highest agreement with the human validation. However, effect sizes of evaluation metric differences are small and the raters agree that in general translations were overall reasonable. While the translations are overall understandable, in practice it should always be clear to users that translations were done automatically and can be erroneous. Moreover, when choosing a translation service for a medical service, other features than translation quality such as speed and data security should be considered.

"Holistic Integration of Performance and Programmatic Metrics in Analysis of Alternatives","P. Malone","Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc., EI Segundo, CA",2025 IEEE Aerospace Conference,"14 Jul 2025","2025","","","1","14","Initiating and completing an objective and robust Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs) when developing a capability, system, or product is influenced by the level of importance of each technical metric (Key Performance Parameter) or desirable attribute. This can be driven by mission, system or product need, stakeholder surveys or system engineers' ad hoc discussions. An AoA as defined by DoD policy is an analytical comparison of the (mission) operational effectiveness, suitability, risk, and life cycle cost of alternatives under consideration to satisfy validated capability needs and affordability. When balancing technical and programmatic performance, then combining them into a single weighted score can be difficult. Moreover, results can differ if weighting allocations change based on stakeholder priorities or influences that change alternative choices. An approach to developing an objective metric for AoAs, are often expressed in terms of technical metrics using the Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS) such as measures of effectiveness (MOEs), measures of suitability (MOSs), or measures of performance (MOPs) among others. They contain multiple technical parameters (e.g., survivability, reliability, availability, range, field of view, etc.) that can be integrated into one overall measure to compare solutions. Key programmatic metrics considered though not often explicit in AoA solutions are schedule, technical maturity, quality, risk, security, and logistics, etc. To support a complete unbiased solution, we provide a framework using the analytical hierarchy process to organize and objectively integrate attributes. Technical and programmatic metrics are combined, into a single measure. The results can then be expressed as a comprehensive group of solutions plotting them on the “Y” axis, (ordinate) against cost on the “X” axis, (abscissa) within an affordability range. It is like cost as an independent variable (CAIV) where finding the “sweet spot” balance between performance and cost. Then we expand the trade space into a three-dimensional solution to highlight some of the more important requirements such as programmatic performance, risk or logistics to provide additional sensitivity from an integrated program management perspective. These visualizations can reveal other drivers not always shown in a holistic solution. We draw from historical system engineering research by Saaty, Keeney and others on technical metric integration, then expand on their work to provide a total integrated technical and programmatic solution that can be applied to a variety of AoAs. Developing representative life cycle cost estimates (LCCE) for each design will accompany each alternative. The LCCEs will be structured using a work breakdown structure integrated with the key metrics, then risk adjusted to provide probabilistic solutions for added fidelity. The results of this methodology will clearly highlight drivers not always shown in a AoA that can influence solution choice or cost and schedule uncertainty when making materiel decisions. Future work will investigate how to consider delaying a final solution “lock in” too early to efficiently integrate technical and programmatic knowledge, address attribute weighting and scalability, investigate the influences of machine learning and validated large language models to support high fidelity AoA studies.","2996-2358","979-8-3503-5597-0","10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068586","","Measurement;Surveys;Schedules;Visualization;Costs;Uncertainty;Systems engineering and theory;US Department of Defense;Stakeholders;Logistics","","","","16","IEEE","14 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To keep up with the ever-increasing need for professionals with ML expertise, for-profit and non-profit organizations conduct a wide range of ML-related courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. Despite the availability of ML-related education materials, there is lack of understanding how students perceive ML-related topics and the dissemination of ML-related topics. A systematic categorization of students' perceptions of these courses can aid educators in understanding the challenges that students face, and use that understanding for better dissemination of ML-related topics in courses. The goal of this paper is to help educators teach machine learning (ML) topics by providing an experience report of students' perceptions related to learning ML. We accomplish our research goal by conducting an empirical study where we deploy a survey with 83 students across five academic institutions. These students are recruited from a mixture of undergraduate and graduate courses. We apply a qualitative analysis technique called open coding to identify challenges that students encounter while studying ML-related topics. Using the same qualitative analysis technique we identify quality aspects do students prioritize ML-related topics. From our survey, we identify 11 challenges that students face when learning about ML topics, amongst which data quality is the most frequent, followed by hardware-related challenges. We observe the majority of the students prefer hands-on projects over theoretical lectures. Furthermore, we find the surveyed students to consider ethics, security, privacy, correctness, and performance as essential considerations while developing ML-based systems. Based on our findings, we recommend educators who teach ML-related courses to (i) incorporate hands-on projects to teach ML-related topics, (ii) dedicate course materials related to data quality, (iii) use lightweight virtualization tools to showcase computationally intensive topics, such as deep neural networks, and (iv) empirical evaluation of how large language models can be used in ML-related education.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893530","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2247141,2310179,2312321); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893530","artifical intelligence;empirical study;machine learning;perception","Surveys;Privacy;Ethics;Systematics;Data integrity;Education;Machine learning;Security;Virtualization;Faces","","","","37","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, machine learning, large language models, and multimodal detection technologies have been widely applied to this field. However, the long-tail distribution of malware samples, with a few dominant classes and many underrepresented ones, significantly impairs the classification performance of machine learning models in malware detection. In this paper, we propose a novel family space dynamic reweighting classification method (FSDR), which dynamically reweights the classifiers by analyzing the spanned space of the family. We meticulously evaluate the magnitude of the spanned space for each category by conducting a thorough analysis of the sample distribution. By treating samples of a class as identically distributed random variables and analyzing their correlations, we derive a simple non-parametric formula to estimate the spanned space of a family. Subsequently, we apply a simple weighting scheme that is inversely proportional to the size of the spanned space for each family, aiming to achieve a more equitable training process. During the training, the weights of the family categories adaptively adjust as the optimized features evolve. The extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used datasets, Malimg and MaleVis, conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FSDR method.

A drone compromised by Byzantine attacks transmits erroneous values to its neighbors while applying wrong input signals for itself, which is aggressive and challenging to defend. Inspired by the concept of digital twin technology, we introduce a new hierarchical protocol equipped with a virtual twin layer (TL), which decouples the challenges into two defense schemes: one against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and the other against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). In the TL, we provide a topology reconfiguration strategy that enhances the resilience of the communication network by judiciously adding a minimal number of key edges. We rigorously demonstrate that the control strategy attains asymptotic consensus within a finite timeframe, given that the topology on the TL adheres to a strongly  $(2f+1)$ -robustness criterion. Within the CPL, decentralized chattering-free controllers are proposed to ensure the resilient output consensus for the heterogeneous multi-UAV systems against Byzantine node attacks. Furthermore, the derived consensus controller exhibits an exponential convergence characteristic. The effectiveness and practicality of the obtained theoretical results are verified by a UAV swarm flight experiment. Note to Practitioners—Cooperative control of UAVs presents significant prospects for application and development, becoming a focal point of automatic control. By modeling UAV swarms as multi-agent systems, various complex distributed control methods have been conveniently proposed and implemented economically in practical systems. However, when certain agents are compromised and interfere with their neighbors, the whole network may become highly susceptible to failure. This paper specifically studies the resilient consensus control against the significant active internal threats, Byzantine attacks. The published results have primarily focused on cases where the leader UAV has no input signals. In practical applications, however, the leader often has a pre-established trajectory sent by the host and the followers are unaware of this input information. This significantly complicates the task of identifying Byzantine attackers. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchical protocol inspired by the concept of digital twin technology, which decouples the challenges into defense against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and the defense against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer. The experiment shows the feasibility and security of our control scheme, which provides valuable guidance for the practical applications of drones.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3420697","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFE0126800); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2024A1515030153); Project of Department of Education of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022KTSCX105,2023ZDZX4046); Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau Technology Research Program(grant numbers:SGDX20230821091559019); Shenzhen Natural Science Fund through the Stable Support Plan Program(grant numbers:20231122121608001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10584430","Byzantine attacks;cooperative control;multi-UAV systems;resilient distributed control","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Consensus control;Topology;Vectors;Network topology;Consensus protocol;Trajectory","","18","","41","IEEE","3 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hybrid attacks in topology networks can result in neighbor information dropouts and inaccuracies among agents. First, the MASs with unknown dynamics are translated to equivalent linear data equations by the dynamic linearization technique. Second, the impact of neighbor information dropouts caused by DoS attacks is mitigated by a designed attack compensation mechanism, in which the compensation error is guaranteed to be bounded in the sense of mathematical expectation. Then, a fully distributed MFASMC algorithm, which does not depend on knowledge of the Laplacian matrix, is designed to improve the robustness of MASs with topology networks exposed to hybrid attacks, thus indirectly mitigating the impact of neighbor information inaccuracies. Finally, the consensus error is rigorously proved to be bounded in the sense of mathematical expectation, and the validity of the proposed strategy is confirmed by simulations. Note to Practitioners—This paper aims to develop a fully distributed MFASMC method to address the consensus problem for unknown MASs with hybrid attacks in network topologies. A hybrid attack compensation mechanism is proposed to mitigate the effects of neighbor information dropouts caused by hybrid attacks. By combining the sliding mode control theory with the model-free adaptive control strategy, the system’s robustness is improved to relieve the impact of neighbor information inaccuracies attributed to hybrid attacks. Since the proposed algorithm does not depend on the mathematical model and Laplace matrix of systems, it can be applied to large-scale MASs with unknown models to solve network topology security problems, such as multiple subway trains, wireless communication systems, and microgrid systems.

This perspective may underestimate the threats posed by vFL, as practical adversaries can deviate from the protocol to enhance their attack capabilities. In response, this work proposes two novel active data reconstruction attacks to compromise data privacy. Each attack induces gradient manipulation during the training phase to breach data privacy. Including an Active Inversion Network (AIN), our first attack exploits a subset of known data in the training set to make passive parties train an auto-encoder (AE) to reconstruct their private data. The second attack introduces an Active Generative Network (AGN) that relies only on the data distribution to train a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) for private feature reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both attacks in three real-world datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, and USCensus.

The proposed method introduces a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) with a predetermined offset to optimize communication efficiency in bandwidth-limited systems. Furthermore, a mechanism for detecting attacks has been developed to ensure the integrity of transmitted information, thereby mitigating the impact of hybrid attacks. Theoretical conditions are established to ensure the input-to-state practical stability of the closed-loop system using the proposed method. Finally, simulation cases are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to existing approaches in scenarios where CPSs encounter similar hybrid attacks.

Although MPC is effective, intermittent network attacks and inaccuracies in state estimation hinder the adjustment of control strategies. To tackle these issues, we propose a predictive control strategy that employs a dynamic event-triggering model with a detection mechanism.

In the past, some browsers evaluated an unknown URL for inclusion in a list of known phishing pages. However, as the number of URLs and known phishing pages continued to increase at a rapid pace, browsers started to include one or more machine learning classifiers as part of their security services that aim to better protect end users from harm. While additional information could be used, browsers typically evaluate every unknown URL using some classifier in order to quickly detect these phishing pages. Early phishing detection used standard machine learning classifiers, but recent research has instead proposed the use of deep learning models for the phishing URL detection task. Concurrently, text embedding research using transformers has led to state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of transformer models on the phishing URL detection task. We consider standard masked language modeling and additional domain-specific pre-training tasks, and compare these models to fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa models. Combining the insights from these experiments, we propose URLTran which uses transformers to significantly improve the performance of phishing URL detection over a wide range of very low false positive rates (FPRs) compared to other deep learning-based methods. For example, URLTran yields a true positive rate (TPR) of 86.80% compared to 71.20% for the next best baseline at an FPR of 0.01%, resulting in a relative improvement of over 21.9%. Further, we consider some classical adversarial black-box phishing attacks such as those based on homoglyphs and compound word splits to improve the robustness of URLTran. We consider additional fine-tuning with these adversarial samples and demonstrate that URLTran can maintain low FPRs under these scenarios.","2155-7586","978-1-6654-3956-5","10.1109/MILCOM52596.2021.9653028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9653028","Phishing Detection;Neural Networks;BERT;Adversarial Robustness","Uniform resource locators;Phishing;Web pages;Transformers;Feature extraction;Robustness;Natural language processing","","50","","41","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the emergence of multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4V, has exhibited transformative potential across a wide range of tasks in various research domains. These models have demonstrated remarkable generalist intelligence and accuracy, owing to their large-scale pre-training on broad datasets and substantially scaled model size. In this study, we explore the application of GPT-4V powering multimodal ChatGPT for dietary assessment, along with prompt engineering and passive monitoring techniques. We evaluated the proposed pipeline using a self-collected, semi free-living dietary intake dataset, captured through wearable cameras. Our findings reveal that GPT-4V excels in food detection under challenging conditions without any fine-tuning or adaptation using food-specific datasets. By guiding the model with specific language prompts (e.g., African cuisine), it shifts from recognizing common staples like rice and bread to accurately identifying regional dishes like banku and ugali. Another standout feature of GPT-4V is its contextual awareness. GPT-4V can leverage surrounding objects as scale references to deduce the portion sizes of food items, further facilitating the process of dietary assessment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3417280","Innovative Passive Dietary Monitoring; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(grant numbers:OPP1171395); SODIAT; U.K.’s Medical Research Council; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:MR/W028336/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10565946","ChatGPT;deep learning;dietary assessment;food recognition;foundation model;GPT-4V;passive monitoring","Artificial intelligence;Estimation;Task analysis;Chatbots;Monitoring;Accuracy;Visualization","Humans;Artificial Intelligence;Nutrition Assessment;Adult;Female;Male;Wearable Electronic Devices;Diet;Generative Artificial Intelligence","14","","53","CCBY","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To adapt SAM, to medical imaging, existing methods primarily rely on tuning strategies that require extensive data or prior prompts tailored to the specific task, making it particularly challenging when only a limited number of data samples are available.

We then apply the concept of the longest common subsequence to deduplicate the API sequences. The BERT model is employed to perform vectorization on the API sequences. The classification model utilizes a transformer architecture based on the lambda attention mechanism, which effectively extracts contextual semantic information from the API call sequences, resulting in improved recognition and classification performance, as well as higher training efficiency. Experiments show that our model achieves higher classification accuracy than traditional models, with an accuracy increase of 2.0% to 5.6% compared to standalone CNN or LSTM models, and an improvement of 0.4% over conventional transformer models that utilize self-attention mechanisms. The use of the lambda attention mechanism results in approximately a 70% reduction in average training time for the transformer model on our dataset compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms, effectively addressing the issue of prolonged convergence times in traditional models. Additionally, comparisons with methods from other literature validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach presented in this paper.","","979-8-3315-4169-9","10.1109/RICAI64321.2024.10911299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10911299","Malicious code;deep learning;Lambda attention mechanism;transformers","Training;Attention mechanisms;Accuracy;Semantics;Transformers;Feature extraction;Malware;Long short term memory;Context modeling;Convergence","","","","41","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Retraining or fine-tuning these models requires substantial human effort and computational resources. To address this, in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling query image segmentation by conditioning on example image-mask pairs provided as prompts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on implicit modeling or non-end-to-end pipelines, we redefine the core interaction mechanism in ICL as an explicit retrieval process, termed E-ICL, benefiting from the emergence of vision foundation models (VFMs). E-ICL captures dense correspondences between queries and prompts at minimal learning cost and leverages them to dynamically weight multi-class prompt masks. Built upon E-ICL, we propose EICSeg, the first end-to-end ICL framework that integrates complementary VFMs for universal medical image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight SD-Adapter to bridge the distinct functionalities of the VFMs, enabling more accurate segmentation predictions. To fully exploit the potential of EICSeg, we further design a scalable self-prompt training strategy and an adaptive token-to-image prompt selection mechanism, facilitating both efficient training and inference. EICSeg is trained on 47 datasets covering diverse modalities and segmentation targets. Experiments on nine unseen datasets demonstrate its strong few-shot generalization ability, achieving an average Dice score of 74.0%, outperforming existing in-context and few-shot methods by 4.5%, and reducing the gap to task-specific models to 10.8%. Even with a single prompt, EICSeg achieves a competitive average Dice score of 60.1%. Notably, it performs automatic segmentation without manual prompt engineering, delivering results comparable to interactive models while requiring minimal labeled data.

Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3556781","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); York Research Chair; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10947002","Responsible artificial intelligence;ethical artificial intelligence;autonomous electric vehicles;generative artificial intelligence;synthetic data","Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Safety;Security;Prevention and mitigation;Data privacy;Roads;ISO Standards;Decision making;Synthetic data","","3","","76","CCBY","1 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, despite the use of many software quality assurance (SQA) practices in software development (e.g., code review, continuous integration), defects may still exist in the official release of a software product. Therefore, prioritizing SQA efforts for the vulnerable areas of the codebase is essential to ensure the high quality of a software release. Predicting software defects at the line level could help prioritize the SQA effort but is a highly challenging task given that only ≈ 3% lines of a codebase could be defective. Existing works on line-level defect prediction often fall short and cannot fully leverage the line-level defect information. In this paper, we propose - Bugsplorer - a novel deep-learning technique for line-level defect prediction. It leverages a hierarchical structure of transformer models to represent two types of code elements: code tokens and code lines. Unlike the existing techniques that are optimized for file-level defect prediction, Bugsplorer is optimized for a line-level defect prediction objective. Our evaluation with five performance metrics shows that Bugsplorer has a promising capability of predicting defective lines with 26–72% better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art technique. It can rank the first 20% defective lines within the top 1–3% suspicious lines. Thus, Bugsplorer has the potential to significantly reduce SQA costs by ranking defective lines higher.","2640-7574","979-8-3503-3066-3","10.1109/SANER60148.2024.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589817","software quality assurance;line-level defect prediction;deep learning;transformers","Measurement;Codes;Costs;Accuracy;Reviews;Biological system modeling;Software quality","","2","","58","IEEE","16 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering, scene layout conditioning, or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless, pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards adressing this challenge, we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multi-layer, instance-wise RGBA decompositions, and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn, we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pre-trained general-purpose models, and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction, instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas, and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets, which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style, composition and complexity. With MuLAn, we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decompo-sition and occlusion information for high quality images, opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI re-search.

However, the huge data scale and complex invocation relationships between services make the root cause localization of faults in microservice systems extremely difficult. Some of the current root cause localization methods based on metrics data use history fault data to effectively improve the localization results, but there are challenges such as not representing history faults effectively and limiting the localization results to repetitive faults that have occurred in history. In this paper, we propose an automatic root cause localization framework MicroHFRCL based on the history fault library to address the above issues. MicroHFRCL constructs an instance causal graph based on metric data for causal analysis. The instance causal graph is weighted by encoding the anomalous subgraph and calculating the similarity of history faults. The PageRank algorithm is used to locate the root cause of faults. Among them, MicroHFRCL learns the structure and feature information of fault anomalous subgraphs through GCN and Transformer models, achieving effective representation of history faults and fast calculation of similarity in history fault codes, improving the efficiency of repetitive fault localization, and effectively solving the problem of the limitation of using history faults for root cause localization results. We implemented MicroHFRCL and tested it on the fault dataset collected by a benchmark microservice test system.

Automating it with conventional text mining faces technical challenges, primarily because the taxonomy often begins with abstract definitions, which experts progressively refine and contextualize as they annotate the corpus.

We exploit these aspects for test generation, focusing in particular on the generation of tests that trigger the precondition of an assertion. On the example of a key assertion we show that, by encoding a variety of different behaviours respondent to the agent's perceptions of the test environment, the agency-directed approach generates twice as many effective tests than pseudo-random test generation, while being both efficient and robust. Moreover, agents can be encoded to behave naturally without compromising the effectiveness of test generation.
